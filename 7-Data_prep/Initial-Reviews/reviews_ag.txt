US	52683195	R3LBRQSDV9V9RI	2764100965	657339014	Taste Of Asia	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Interesting and fun	This is a big book. It is taller than normal and it is thickish and heavy. It is a sturdy book that will put up with a lot of wear and use. There are nice color pictures and some recipes have pictures of how to make a dish to go with the directions.<br /><br />The recipes are fun and are from all over Asia. They are actually devided into country of origin rather than by type of recipe. For example, the recipes from one country are grouped together rather than having all of the chicken dishes grouped together. I like the layout and look of this book and have found it easy to use.<br /><br />While it has some ingredients that are uncommon that is part of the nature of cooking these types of dishes. The directions are easy to follow and the results are great. There are some of the more traditional type of dishes you might expect to find (egg rolls, spring rolls etc) and some unexpected recipes as well.<br /><br />I really enjoy this cookbook. I use it quite a bit.<br /><br />Enjoy.	2005-10-10

Some were effective for me and some weren't.  If there was a point where I didn't mesh with the style of a teacher, there inevitably was someone who got a lot out of the lesson/class/teacher.  It seems in this book that Palmer is trying to say that there is one way to teach as well as one way to learn.  There is also only one way to find truth.  I find these conclusions very misleading, as everyone is different and will take things in differently. <br /> <br />One very strong part about this book were the many examples from different parts of life.  I think one quote that sums up the book quite nicely comes from Thomas Merton who said, \\"the purpose of education is to show a person how to define himself authentically and spontaneously in relation to his world.\\"  That is, it isn't to force things upon people, but to let them figure out how things relate to their lives and experience them in a way only an individual can. <br /> <br />That said, it seems as if the truth is out there waiting for us to find it.  This book seems to imply though, that the truth is different for all people.  I strongly disagree with this, the truth is universal regarding certain criteria, but it is how we interpret things that makes it pertinent to our lives as people of the world.  Palmer goes on though, to say that truthful knowing isn't just some random thing that is out there, and it isn't something we can manipulate, but something we must participate in.  This is a great statement that needs to be brought out more and given a more prominent place in the book. <br /> <br />\\"To Know as we are Known\\" is a great synthesis of education and spirituality and should be read by those teaching in a church setting.  It isn't exclusive of the spiritual realm of education and should be read by the secular educators as well, but it fits in very well in a Christian Education setting.  It is a good read and goes bypretty quickly.  You won't regret reading this, but as with all things, take it with a grain of salt.	2005-10-10

I found it very hard trying to figure out what was going to happen next. The development of this story is good in terms of how it moves through the character's eyes showing you what happened to her in the past and how she's dealing with her own problems in her present time. While the story may seem at times to be moving at a rapid pace, this novel is in my opinion, riveting and quite captivating. What I did like most about the novel is the strong bond between Roxane and her uncle Cecil. Whereby her father's a total screw up and a pervert, she at least still had somewhat of a father figure in her life which probably is what kept her from totally hating men. Not to mention, being raped by your own father isn't an easy thing to get over, so her having that kind of bond with a male member of her family was the least likely thing for me to believe could take place. I do like that Cecil was the hero in her life. And that's my reason for giving the book 5 star rating.  <br /> <br />I'd recommend this book as a read to women all over as I know there's still a great many women still struggling with the painful memory of being abused sexually and just as many in a physically abusive relationship in some shape or form. Goins has written a touching and very moving story about such a delicate subject many choose to ignore. As the main character points out in the story, abuse is abuse, no matter what form it's presented in.	2005-10-10

You may know him from [...] or from any of his several other Web sites and newsletters.<br /><br />For The Top 101 Experts Who Help Us Improve Our Lives, he looked into which self-help experts are most often searched for on the Web.  Having identified who they are, he devised an ingenious format for briefly describing how each one got their start, what their key message is, how to find out more about them on-line and where to start in investigating their work.<br /><br />It's that last point that makes this book special.  Many of these experts have written lots of books, created many audio and video products and deliver many seminars and courses.  Without someone to guide you where to enter that maze of material, you would quickly become confused by starting with something that's too advanced for you.<br /><br />The experts include classic self-help gurus like Tony Robbins, Dale Carnegie and Stephen Covey; business improvement experts like Ken Blanchard, Brian Tracy and Jim Collins; psychologists like Dr. Phil McGraw; spiritual healers like Deepak Chopra and Caroline Myss; personal finance teachers like Robert Allen, Robert Kiyosaki and Bruce Wilkinson; and relationship counselors like John Gray and Barbara De Angelis.  There's no attempt to separate out the \\"serious\\" from the \\"popular\\".  You find Sylvia Browne ahead of the Dalai Lama.<br /><br />Unless you are a committed self-help junkie, chances are that you haven't read anything by more than a few dozen of these people.  With this reference, you can decide which of the others is most worthy of your attention.  That will save you countless hours and lots of money.<br /><br />If there's a better guide to the top self-help experts, I don't know what it is.  Get this book today!	2005-10-10

This collection published posthumously reminds us all that he richly deserved the Nobel Prize. How many poets can we point to that were writing after the age of 90? Milosz is humble about his perceptions of the world but his horizon is vast--enough to take in both faith and doubt in the same work. Of very special note in the collection is the poem \\"Eyes.\\"     \\"My most honorable eyes, you are not in the best of shape.  I receive from you an image less than sharp, . . . \\"    \\"Eyes\\" is a poem of depth and true insight, which tells us something about a way of looking at the world as one moves on in life, \\"away from the fairgrounds of the world.\\"  There is an inner life, a deep inner truth which takes in all. It is a vision at once mystical and secular.     Milosz is a master, straddling eras and cultures. What can a 90-plus-year-old poet tell us about sexuality and desire? Amazing things--revelations, truly. But don't expect the cheap sensuality of popular culture.    Milosz and his poems have endured throughout our lives and will remain with us for a very long time. In Second Space he opens up a space that is rich and exciting.	2005-10-10

Nancy Chandler Pittman makes NO apologies for her weird doctrinal blends..Much Christianity comes from Pagan religions. I like people who are not afraid to use logic..What the H? She has interesting historical sources for the feminization of the Holy Spirit which is very interesting. She quotes rich and diverse sources. At least in this section, her scholarship is thorough unlike what some of her reviewers have said. Kings X is a group that sings metal and funk and Beatles style stuff for those of you who may be interested in Christian-Wicca rock, check out \\"Gretchen Goes to Nebraska\\" (named for Lion,Witch and Wardrobe by C.S.Lewis I think..)by them. Carl McColman (sp?) has written a book called \\"Embracing Jesus and the Goddess\\"( I think), which is well written. And it flows better than Nancy's work, and is more exciting, but the scholarly work is hard to make readable. Nancy's work is interesting when she talks about the evolution of her belief system into what is Christian Wicca, a weird mishmash. But whatever..Makes for a chock-filled rich liturgy. Hey..Give us a line on how your beliefs develop..Notice this is (Mary is sacred..)the OnLy book, I have darker leanings,(see my other reviews..), . ..with such a (..dark!..)name for these beliefs, and I reward pioneers.

It seemed like a good premise, but could have been a lot better.  The writing style is so poor, with such tenuous logic, that any points that the author makes about racism are weakened.  The characters are two-dimensional and don't behave like real people.  They just serve to move the plot from point A to point B.  So many of the characters are thin stereotypes that the overall message is diluted.  The main character, named Macon, is the \\"downest\\" white guy ever.  He seems to be an embarrassing alter-ego for the author (who has some hip-hop album reviews on his web site if you want a sample his writing style).  Macon is not exactly a hero, but something of an Eminem among black political leaders.  Macon's political message is somewhat ambivalent, and it's easy to lose interest in his character halfway through.  The ending is ridiculous and ruins the story.  Mansbach's overall writing style can be downright embarrassing.  He's overly earnest in his attempt at hipness.  He often uses bad poetry slam writing full of paens to hip-hop, with cringe-inducing use of words like \\"pimpstrut\\" as a verb.  The book also includes fictional segments from the memoir of an early negro baseball player, but they're written in a revisionist style that's way out of touch with the writing of that time.  It's another fatal error that prevents the book from ringing true.  I wanted to like this book, and found some of the observations on racial identity to be very acute, but overall it just doesn't work - not even as a criticism of white people trying to adopt black culture.  A writer like Gore Vidal, for example, can write about controversial subjects like this with absurdity and insight, but Adam Mansbach just doesn't succeed.  For a better book on racism, skip Angry Black White Boy and just read Richard Wright's book Black Boy instead (or any other classic works on racism from authors who actually know what they're talking about, unlike Mr. Mansbach).Mansbach).	2005-10-10

I once told a friend that the reason I keep reading Ms. Slaughter's books was that I wanted to see how ridiculous each one was.  In that respect, this was a disappointment.  It was actually the best-written book in the \\"Grant County\\" series, and that's not saying much.    This book has its share of problems.  First, the situation regarding Jeffrey's health issue.  This hung over the story only to be resolved half way through the book with a simple two-word sentence.  After that, it was referred to once and only briefly.  I'm not exactly clear as to why this was even in the book (oh, yeah, Jeffrey once cheated on Sara - \\"Faithless\\" - very clever.)    Next, it is obvious to me the Slaughter really dislikes her own characters.  There is nothing remotely likeable about any of them, and she seems to have a truly distasteful, offensive hatred toward all of her female characters.  If you're a female character in a Karin Slaughter book, rest assured she will find a horrible, disgusting way to brutalize you.    Then there is the character of Lena.  To say that this character is a downer is putting it mildly.  She is without a doubt the most depressing, gloomy, pathetic character I have ever read in any book.  I have no interest in her as a character anymore.  She needs to go.    Lastly, what was with the Heart references?  Did the Wilson sisters pay Slaughter for a mention in the book?  True to form, Slaughter even found a way to insult Ann Wilson.    Wow, can't wait for the next one...	2005-10-10

The problem is not that the chapters alternate between the present and the past (if you are any kind of reader you've been there, done that), the problem is not that it is an unfamiliar landscape - we are talking 20th century Africa here. The problem is that after 100 pages, nothing has happened.  <br /> <br />Now, that might be okay provided that there were some detailed character studies. Alas, there are none of these either.  <br /> <br />I must echo an earlier observation that the author tried to pack in too many ideas to make any of them work properly. Interesting events are brought into play that after only a few paragraphs or a couple of pages are dropped and lost forever. Perhaps Abani was trying to show the rapid progression of life and the constant change occuring in Africa at the time but it does not make for good reading.  <br /> <br />Added effects, like the recipes that end each chapter, are neat but don't tie the story together in any pertinent way - the characters hardly ever eat or focus on food preparation and Elvis' memories of his mother do not dwell on food, either.  <br /> <br />The chapter prefixes on the Kola nut are also interesting but distract from the story and are forgotten as soon as the story continues.  <br /> <br />I had not heard of Mr. Abani's work prior to this novel and was shocked to see the list of credits to his name. On further consideration, I decided that this is a poet's novel - each scene may have been better written as a series of poems with the stunning imagery of the continent and commentary on the difficutlies of life left to themselves without attempts to connect them inbetween.  <br /> <br />I cannot, unfortunatley, recommend this to lovers of fiction, but I do intend to take a look at some of Mr. Abani's poetry.	2005-10-10

Hunt, Commander Of Artillery, Army Of The Potomac	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Master of Artillery	When reading this book you can't help but admire Henry Hunt. This is a man who knew what he was best at, artillery, and knew how best to use it. If only his superiors understood what a true asset they had in this man. Henry Hunt was a Hero of the Mexican War and the Civil War. It was a mistake for the government and Grant never to promote him to Major General during the war, and to Brigadier General after the war. This man really can be considered the father of American Artillery in my opinion. He designed artillery, wrote manuals on artillery, and was overall a true pioneer for the use of artilley. His theories on the massed use of artillery, which he was able to display at Malvern Hill and Gettysburg to great effect, were very good and it was a shame he never saw his dream of a unified corps of artillery come true.   <br /> <br />I think Longacre did a pretty good job with General Hunt. His chapters on Malvern Hill and Gettysburg in particular were very good. I think he did a good job portraying the situation between Hunt and Joe Hooker. You really do come away from this knowing that Hooker knew next to nothing when it came to artillery and that had he followed Hunt's advice and gave Hunt the power he needed Chancellorsville may very well have been a very different battle. One thing I found out from this book that both interested me and caught me by surprise was the friction between Hunt and Winfield Hancock. They really didn't get along that well at all, both having very different views when it came to the use of artillery. Hancock was an incredible Corps commander but when reading this biography you definitely see that Hancock would have been better off following Hunt's advice when it came to artillery.  <br /> <br />Only real complaint would be that the biography could have been longer. I think Longacre could have done a better job, or at least more detailed job, with Hunt before the Civil War. I think Hunt in Mexico was rushed a bit. I also think the post-Gettysburg section of the book, specifically the Overland Campaign and Petersburg could have been given more spotlight. I thought this part of the book seemed a bit rushed.  <br /> <br />But overall a very good biography of a very good soldier.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

James and her prolific detective Adam Dalgliesh, I was a little hesitant to stray from that series into the first one devoted to Cordelia Gray.  Yet \\"An Unsuitable Job for a Woman\\" is a richly rewarding read, with the classic elements that mark James' writing and a mystery as twisted as anything that Dalgliesh would find himself up against (and the fact that he makes an appearance later in the book is a boon).  James went out on a limb crafting a new detective, a young female one at that, but succeeds in establishing Cordelia Gray in easy company with her more reknowned detective.<br /><br />\\"An Unsuitable Job for a Woman\\" introduces readers to Cordelia Gray, a twenty-two year old private investigator who has just inherited the entire investigation buisness from her partner after his suicide.  She finds herself at odds with how to make ends meet, when a case is thrown her way that was originally intended for her partner.  Cordelia makes her way to Cambridge, at the request of the famous scientist Ronald Callender.  He is at a loss to explain the suicide of his young son and hires Cordelia to find out why his son killed himself.  As soon as Cordelia starts searching and asking questions regarding the young heir's death, she finds herself convinced that the case is one of murder, not suicide, and that her own life may be at risk.<br /><br />Cordelia Gray has her work cut out for her.  Secrets abound everywhere, and she must make her way in a 'man's world' to uncover the truth behind the mystery.  The writing is surprisingly fast-paced for a novel that is introducting a new character, but James throws in the necessary information about her new sleuth as the novel progresses.  It is told in natural flashbacks through Cordelia's thoughts on the case at hand.  I look forward to reading the other Cordelia Gray mystery and am sure I will find myself wishing there were more.	2005-10-10

I agree the books are very funny - genuine laugh outloud funny - but the schtick and generalizations (Iowans, Swiss, Germans and in later books, New Yorkers, Irish and Italians) was overly broad and only funny the first time. The tenth time in less then two pages that there was some comment about Irish time or Italian's dressing better really started to tick me off. I could say it's because I live in Iowa but having not grown up here I don't think that's the case. By the way, I've lived in western and central Iowa for a decade and never heard 'uff da' from anyone native or otherwise and Hunter obviouly hadn't heard of the Loess Hills which eat up a third of the state - - not that they are by any means the Swiss Alps.  <br />That aside, Hunter does have an interesting turn of phrase and I was surprised to find myself actually laughing out loud in a way I haven't done since I read Bridget Jones, Edge of Reason.  <br />As I said, I'll continue to go to the library to check them out when I'm desperate for something to read but unlike other series which I actively purchase, this will not be on my list either for Amazon or a used bookstore purchase.	2005-10-10

Perhaps the best part of this book is that the clues are laid out in the open, but their meaning is hard to figure out whereas in most Carr books the clues are hidden; however, had you known that was a clue you would immediately figure out what it means.  You get to know and like the characters in this book and J.D. gives you lots of hints to make you think each of them could be the killer.  Unlike many of his other stories the explanation of how the murder could have happened in a locked room does not involve anything so physically complex and impossible to imagine, but rather lends itself naturally from the descriptions given.	2005-10-10

Jim Fraiser's novel brings it all back with a vengeance. The plot's about a hurricane hunter pilot who flies through the hurricane, and sends back a report that nobody believes--there's never been a hurricane that powerful before. It's great finding out what it's like to fly through a hurricane, and its sickening to see  how news reports were so wrong about Camille as late as hours before she hit the Mississippi coast in 1969. The pilot gets back home just in time to be with his wife and child as the hurricane's eye, with 200+ mph winds, a thirty foot tidal wave, and two of its 80 tornados strike their two-story home near the beach.

The book is geared toward understanding bilingualism as practiced in a wide range of groups.

The more I read, the more I see that readers are believing this novel is Stanley Ketchel's biography. It may be well written as readers who are fans of Mr Blake's stories, will attest. But, do not be regaled, into believing this, smarmiest of the smarmy tale. The elder Mr. Kiecal was not Stanley's step-father. Stanley Ketchel did not leave home because of any violence between he and his father. At 12 years of age, his mother gave him permission to leave home. He was not an alcoholic, he seldom drank at all, he was a prankster, and he only smoked cigars, when he attended social events. The factual tale, is fabulous without benefit(?) of fiction. So, please, don't settle into this story.  This fictional composite, dabbles more, in folk-lore, than what actually happened in this courageous, and powerful young man's short life.  Thank you, and please remember. This is written from imagination. Creative, but predominantly, a fabrication, none the less.	2005-10-10

This is a great story to bring kids to classical music. It presents the intriguing world of 18th Century Venice to the modern child. I was interested in this book because I am interested in the Pieta and Vivaldi's life in general. Overall, this book was well researched and thoughtfully presented for a young audiance. <br /> <br />It did irk me that the main character is not a real orphan but one who actually had parents. It was the policy of the Pieta to condemn parents who tried to pass thier children off orphans when they were not actually. I would have liked to see the main character have been a real orphan. <br /> <br />There were a few things that were historically inacurare as well. Children were no brought to the Pietas and raised there. They were brought,and then sent into the country to be raised until they were old enough to come back. Also the ending is wrong as well. She becomes an opera singer, when in reality women at the Pieta either stayed there thier entire lives of left in favor of marriage/convent. If they did leave, they had to promise never to preform in public. <br /> <br />I would say unless you really love this book, please go for \\" Vivaldi's Ring Of Mystery\\".	2005-10-10

A frightening memoir of growing up under Iran's male-dominated oppressors, confirming <br />that the mad ayatollahs have, in 27 years, wrecked a once-vibrant nation and <br />destroyed its culture. <br />Omid's Iran is a dysfunctional society in a \\"coma of ignorance,\\" led by \\"mindless fanatics.\\" <br />Males are obsessed with money and hymens. Women, if they aren't victims, have sold <br />out and joined the Pasdar spies who hound female violators of the ayatollahs' decrees. <br />Throughout, Omid displays numerous perceptive, valuable observations: Ayatollah <br />Khomeini's command of Farsi was so weak he could barely be understood; his mullahs took <br />the Shah's palaces after the overthrow, then cornered the black market for food to become <br />\\"even richer\\" than the Shah; 70 percent of Iran's villages have been destroyed or abandoned <br />under the mullahs. She also harbors no illusions about Iran's wickedness: \\"If Iran becomes a nuclear power,\\" she warns, \\"the world should start digging, <br />either their shelters or their graves...\\" What is most riveting, however, is her striking journal of personal pain within her abusive family-her brother <br />forced her into persistent incest, her wealthy father humiliated her and abandoned the family to destitution and she was forced to battle her way out of <br />one arranged engagement after another. Little wonder she has emerged on the far side, in Vancouver, as a brittle manic-depressive finding it difficult to <br />outrun her past. Omid wrote most of Living in Hell in a single month while under a therapist's care, imbuing the work with a powerful sense of urgency. <br />Passionate and commanding. <br />Omid, Ghazal <br />LIVING IN HELL: A True Odyssey <br />of a Woman's Struggle in Islamic Iran <br />Against Personal and Political Forces <br />Park Avenue Publishers (488 pp.) <br />$26.95 <br />July 30, 2005 <br />ISBN: 0-9759683-0-0 <br />-Kirkus Discoveries <br />Kirkus Discoveries, VNU US Literary Group, 770 Broadway, New York, NY 10003 646-654-4602 fax 646-654-4706 <br />discoveries@kirkusreviews.com	2005-10-10

While Shirow does mention that this book is not a continuation of the first, there are some major differences in style.<br /><br />Let's start with the artwork.  As I've noticed with Shirow's work, all the ways from Appleseed, his style has matured with each work and is at a very advanced level, in my opinion, among top comic book artists in the world.  He has a certain style of coloring that, to me, is really unique in how subtle, lifelike, and tactile he makes fabrics and skin.  While only roughly 35-40% of the book is colored, it is done so fantastically.<br /><br />In addition, Shirow has a supreme mastery of the female body form.  It's simply stunning to see how beautifully he can render the female body, especially with the dynamic energy he brings to his characters.  While he renders many of the panels with the female characters in the buff, he does not render \\"R\\" nudity, but rather \\"PG-13\\" nudity, except in one panel).  (As a sidenote, parents of younger readers should perhaps consider this an \\"R\\" rated book. While none of the nudity is gratuitous, it can be a little too much for some).<br /><br />As fans of Shirow have noticed, he has been experimenting with integrating 3D, rendered environments and objects with his 2D artwork.  He shows his mastery of this technique in many of the panels, where it seems seemless; you feel as if the character is really a part of the scene.  Then in others, it seems poorly done (for example, he renders pigs in a sequence of panels and the pigs just look weird).  I'd also offer some criticism of his rendering of \\"virtual space\\", as it quickly becomes cluttered and very difficult to navigate, visually, especially in the low-res, black and white lineart panels.<br /><br />As with all Shirow works, there is certainly enough cool technobabble and gadgets to get your geek juices flowing.  From exoskeletons that envelope and \\"swallow\\" the pilot, to oddly constructed androids, to the techno-metaphysical discussions of reality, life, existence, and justice.<br /><br />My main criticism with the work is the incontinuity *within* the plot itself (I fully understand and accept that this is not a continuation of the first).  Without going deeply into the plot, there are some scenarios where he will start what seems like an arc, but then the arc disappears, without entering into the plot again.  It seems like whole parts of the book were created just for the sake of showing artwork, and not progressing plot (to me, plot should always come first in a written work, which this is, despite the medium).  It feels like the recent Star Wars movies in that they are really a showcase for Lucas's technique with fully rendered set and have lost any semblence of a cohesive plot and great acting (especially Harrison Ford) that made the first three the classics that they are.  Yes, while I do appreciate the eye candy, this is still a graphic novel, and, as such, I expect a cohesive plot and not random interjections of this and that and whatever.<br /><br />Some fans will also find the lack of action (compared to the first book) a bit disappointing.  The first book was far grittier and more action packed than this book.  It also had a richer cast of characters.  \\"Man-Machine Interface\\" really only features one character (albeit in various bodies and forms) and thus loses some of the dynamic interactions between characters.  Shirow never gets a chance to fully developer the chief of Poseidon police and his crew.<br /><br />Overall, this book is excellent if you simply love Shirow's beautiful artwork, mastery of the female body form, and creative techno-gadgets.  The plot, especially the ending, will leave you sorely disappointed.  Whereas the first ended on a revelation of a metaphysical type, this book ends in a fizzle.constructed androids, to the techno-metaphysical discussions of reality, life, existence, and justice.

She had to depend on her nasty father's mercy to have a shelter for her and the un-born baby, but in return, she had to agree to the baby's adoption as her father's daughter, also as her sister. He had been using the baby to make her do anything he wanted her to do for him, including a convenient marriage to  Alexander Doumas, and to give him a grandson to pass on his inheritance. And Mia would get her daughter back in the end. <br /> <br />Alex himself wanted to have his family's island back desparately in order to fulfill his late-father's wish, and he had to agree to Jack Frazier's condition. He looked down on Mia even more because of her motives, which he assumed it had to be money, just as she had told him for she was not allowed to give out anything about the truth, or she would loose her daughter. She was so afraid of what her callous father might do if she broke the rules.  <br /> <br />She had so much bitterness towards men like her father, and she had believed Alex was no difference, same cunning and heartless. But then she couldn't deny the hot-passion between them, eventhough their hatred for each other. They had the same goal, to make a baby-boy, she would get her daughter and he would get his precious island. <br /> <br />Later, Alex learnt about the truths and he decided that he couldn't let her wife suffer any longer. He had to put an end to all the lies given by her father. He could lose his island, but not his expecting wife and her daughter. But it was impossible for Mia to trust him to save her from her father, or to value her more than his island. In the end, his love for her was proved to be true, and came the happiness into her life. <br />  <br />This is my first Ms.Reid's book, from which then I became her fan and have been collecting her books. I love her style and fantastic imagination in her writing. As for this one, I'd love to give her a \\"10-TOP-STARS\\"!	2005-10-10

The format is different in the sense, that entire chapters are made of quasi-independent paragraphs which are direct quotes or paraphrases from different people. It gives the book a distinct look, not necessarily a format the average business-related book follows. In that sense, the book takes a little getting used to. However, the book does provide some very interesting insights on some of the events (sort of backstage news) that have roiled Wall Street over its existence.

As part of his rehabilitation he roams the streets of his neighbourhood, where one day he finds the Paper Palace, a stationary shop where he buys a blue Portuguese notebook from the Chinese owner. When he gets home he immediately starts to write a story about a man who one day walks out on his wife and disappears without a trace. But after a while he gets stuck and does not know how to continue. In the meantime he finds out that his wife is pregnant, his house is broken into, he endangers his marriage when he encounters the Chinese shopowner Mr  Chang again, his best friend, the renowned author John Trause, has health problems and the son of this best friend ends up in a rehab centre. And all that in the timespan of nine days. As Sidney tries to cope with all this he needs his blue notebook to make sense of all the developments. <br /> <br />This book gets mixed reviews on Amazon and I see the problems that some people have with the two relatively unfinished story lines. Paul Auster can definitely write: even though the story as such was not terribly interesting to me (except for the story within the story of the guy who disappears without a trace), the book is so well-written that I was simply forced to read on.	2005-10-10

As you read down the list of the 759 previous reviews, it is easy to suggest that if you are a Republican, conservative,  Bush lover, church goer or \\"Red Stater,\\" you will love this book, but that if you are a Democrat, liberal, CBS news employee, New York Times subscriber or \\"Blue Stater\\" that you will dislike it.    However, this is too simplistic an interpretation of what Bernard Goldberg has put together in \\"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America.\\"  At the book's heart, Goldberg  is decrying the corruption of values that once defined and brought us together as a nation of people, but now divide people through arrogance, deceit, greed and intolerance into scores of self-serving victims, special needs/protected class groups et als.    Granted, Goldberg has a predominantly conservative bias, but his attack is not so much about Liberals or Conservatives as it is directed to hypocrites of all genres who attempt to bully society and poison the culture under the guise of hubris.    And, attack is what Goldberg does.  He goes after 100 people who (in his judgment) are screwing up America, some of whom are recognizably easy and obvious, and many others who are unknown and insidious.  But, in all cases the author clearly states his case in a very easy-to-read writing style.    The meek may never inherit the Earth, but thanks to Goldberg, the arrogant and the greedy and the mean spirited and (especially) the hypocrites who often behave as though they already own it, have been called to account.    The key to this book is that in constructing his list, Goldberg has challenged his readers to a debate.  That 760 responses have already been posted on Amazon (yielding a well distributed 3 star average) tells you that he has succeeded in reaching a level of passion not commonly achieved.      What else is an author supposed to do if not to make you think?    You may either like his list, or hate it - but you will read it, and you will read it all the way to the end - then compose your own additions or deletions - and perhaps even post your opinion like all the 760 others (and counting) before you.

This version, which updates Edersheim's magnificent 19th century edition, contains color photos of some of the best researched models of the Herodian Temple at Jerusalem and is your one-stop-shopping source for information on structure, priesthood function, liturgical song and rites.  Eyewitnesses to the Temple, such as Philo and Josephus are consulted and cited.  Rabbinic material is investigated and used to support the text.<br /><br />The Temple is depicted in painstakingly detailed models and maps based on the best archaeological evidence and eyewitness reports.  Edersheim and his successors then take you through the priesthood functions as well as the rules specific to behavior in/around the Temple, and funding sources such as the various taxes and offerings.  Next the sacrifices are covered.  I found the most striking chapter for me to be \\"At Night in the Temple,\\" where Edersheim takes you on rounds with the priests and temple guard.  Everything is here, the feasts, the Passover, the Day of Atonement.<br /><br />If you're a Jew, this text will help you in your studies of pre-diaspora Jewish Temple worship.  If you're a Christian, it sheds more context on the New Testament by filling in blanks that would have made sense to 1st century Jewish Christians.  One can sense just how devastating the loss of the Temple in 70AD must have been for the religious Jews of Jerusalem.	2005-10-10

The ideas in this book are good so don't get me wrong...but I don't know how many women today could just sit back and smile and make happy while, for example, their husband is off with another woman waiting for him to see how much better things would be back at home.  I believe the husband is the head of the household but I can't believe that God intends for a \\"submissive wife\\" to allow her husband that is committing adultry to continue to live in their house, sleep in their bed, and be an example for their children.	2005-10-10

This book does a fine job in showing us how companies such as McDonalds, Nike, Kodak, DeBeers, and others have learned these lessons to their benefit.<br /><br />McDonalds used to ignore women while focusing on children and men.  By listening to women and letting women help design their new salads, they have not only increases sales, but increased the dollars per order as well.  Kodak, went back to its roots and created products for digital photography that were easy to use and empowered women who weren't interested in becoming technical experts to take and print great pictures.  Nike opened a huge new market by creating products specifically for women rather than simply cutting down men's products.  Women want and need different equipment and fashion.  DeBeers realized that their traditional market of selling to men to buy for women was cutting them out of the market of single women who could buy diamonds for themselves.<br /><br />This is a book of eye opening case studies and contains lessons for every business.  There may be things to bemoan about the course our current culture is taking, but businesses have to function and sell in the present.  This book can help you see what others have found and maybe help you think through possible new directions for your own company and its products and services.	2005-10-10

It's classic Lewis; it inspires the reader and delivers deep insight in laymen's terms. <br /> <br />The text is a treasure chest embedded with jewels like this: <br /> <br />\\"God, who needs nothing, loves into existence wholly superfluous creatures in order that He may love and perfect them.  He creates the universe already foreseeing - or should we say \\"seeing\\"?  there are no tenses in God - the buzzing cloud of flies about the cross, the flayed back pressed against the uneven stake, the nails driven through the mesial nerves, the repeated incipient suffocation as the body droops, the repeated torture of the back and arms as it is time after time, for breath's sake, hitched up.  If I may dare the biological image, God is a \\"host\\" who deliberately creates His own parasites; cause us to be that we may exploit and \\"take advantage of\\" Him.  Herein is love.  This is the diagram of Love Himself, the inventor of all loves.\\" <br /> <br />In a word: beautiful.	2005-10-10

Sklansky's books about limit poker are excellent reads, however, this book is lacking of any advanced poker theory.  For beginners, I would recommend any books by Tom McEvoy and T.J. Cloutier.

I'm me." --JL	I was lucky enough to help make this beautiful book happen. (I was the editor.) Everyone who saw this book through the various stages of its development were constantly riveted--by the storytelling, the photos, the design, the revelations (I didn't know John's mom was killed when he was 17! I didn't know that Ringo was actually considered to be a great drummer! I didn't know Brian Epstein died so young! I didn't know John loved Alice in Wonderland!) This is the perfect book for both kids AND adults because it's more like reading someone's personal photo album and memory book than reading an old-fashioned biography. For every photo, there's a story, for every story, there's a photo. The author used hundreds of quotes from John's interviews, giving the book HIS voice and not her own. We found some great photos of John as a little boy, and it's so much fun to see someone who you only knew as a Beatle splashing around on a school trip at the age of nine. You can see exactly who John was even then! And the book design is just captivating. Also, if you are looking for a book that takes you on a seamless journey from the very beginning to the very end, this is the book for you. Many people didn't realize that the famous photos with Yoko taken by Annie Leibovitz were taken the day John was killed. (Think naked John laying next to Yoko) Each chapter begins in John's own words, and all of the many influences in his life, from the goon show, to Little Richard and Chuck Berry, to Paul, and Aunt Mimi, and Yoko, and everyone--they are all here. So enjoy!	2005-10-10

The Dixie Hummingbirds are probably the most world-famous vocal group in the entire history of gospel, with many hundreds of recordings from 1939 well into the rock era.  They are ENTIRELY ABSENT from this book.  Yes, really, I'm not joking; my jaw dropped open when I discovered it.  The Swan Silvertones are another of the most beloved groups in gospel history, with their \\"Oh Mary Don't You Weep\\" one of the candidates for greatest gospel record ever; they're nowhere to be found here.  Incredible but true. The Rev. Gary Davis is an all-time gospel legend having originated many well-loved classic songs; the authors apparently never heard of him.  The recordings of Washington Phillips have been influential on generations of gospel artists; he, too, is missing in action.  I suppose we should consider ourselves fortunate that Mahalia Jackson made the cut. <br /> <br />The more accurate subtitle of this book should be \\"The Encyclopedia of Gospel Performers from 1970 to Today, plus a Small Number of Gospel Performers Before 1970.\\"  Recorded gospel music goes back more than 100 years, but the authors are apparently either ignorant of this rich history, or simply don't care about it. Did anyone actually edit this book who knew the first thing about gospel music history?  I feel badly for the great Mavis Staples, who wrote an introduction for this book that totally ignores many of the artists who were crucial inspirations for her career.  I'm sure she's deeply embarrassed at having her name associated with this abomination, this travesty. <br />  <br />Yes, there is some useful information here on modern-era gospel performers and a very small number of earlier greats.  But for those of us who had been waiting for years fora true gospel music encyclopedia and ordered this book believing this was it, \\"Uncloudy Days\\" is a cruel deception and a horrendous disappointment. Buyer beware.   I only hope that before too long someone else will publish a true, historically accurate gospel music encyclopedia.  Because this, most emphatically, is NOT it.  <br /> <br />Steve Sullivan	2005-10-10

Not only does it capture the spirit of the famous Venetian bar at a fraction of the cost of an actual visit, the recipes are surprisingly easy and, for the most part, quite manageable by the home cook. There are very few hard to find ingredients, the methods are mostly straight forward, and the results most pleasing. Arrigo Cipriani stresses the Harry's is indeed a bar, and not primarily a fine dining restaurant. This does not mean that the food is not fine, rather it means that the food is very fresh, typical, simple Italian fare. The sort of food that has made the many cuisines of Italy so popular all over the world. The recipes give readers the opportunity to reproduce this type of food wherever they live. <br />If you wish to be vicariously transported to Venice, with some minimal cooking and cocktail mixing competence you can be in Harry's at least in your mind's eye.	2005-10-10

First, for a \\"reassessment\\" of eugenics, Lynn seems very fond of the original eugenic principles set forth by Sir Francis Galton over 100 years ago.  He dismisses several eugenic propositions set forth by more contemporary thinkers simply because they do not match with Galton's original ideas.  Furthermore, while Lynn includes a section on biotechnology, he seems to place little emphasis on its importance.     Secondly, as I suppose should be expected of a book about eugenics, Lynn places heavy emphasis on nature's influence on intelligence, health, and personality.  The standard stance in the social sciences is to accept nature and nurture as having a 50/50 influence on these factors unless there is compelling evidence to the contrary.  And while Lynn does attempt to make a case for favoring nature over nurture, his evidence is sometimes shoddy.  Lynn often asserts causation when he only presents a correlation and is prone to mixing his units of analysis (this is called the ecological fallacy in the social sciences).      Also, I found this book to be offensive (and inaccurate) in its classist nature.  Lynn writes of encouraging higher birth rates among the rich as if wealth is the same as genetic superiority.  While research shows that people of higher socioeconomic status are more likely to have better genes, higher IQs, etc, this is not absolute.  According to the APA Task Force report on intelligence, the correlation between parental SES and child's IQ is .33.  Any successful eugenics program would need a much better measure of genetic fitness than SES alone.    However, in spite of these failings, I do believe that \\"Eugenics: A Reassessment\\" is an important work for anyone who is interested in eugenics and its place in modern society.  Lynn must be given credit for attempting to defend eugenics at a time when such a stance is horribly unpopular.  And while this bookhas its weaknesses, Lynn does provide ample evidence that a) eugenics would be effective in improving IQ, reducing genetic birth defects, and increasing positive personality traits and b) many of us already support eugenics without knowing it.  Just a few examples of this include:    - Selective plant and animal breeding has been highly successful in producing 'superior' stock (insect resistant crops, higher yielding dairy cattle, etc).  Why should selective breeding of humans be any different?  - A multitude of studies on twins and adopted children show a significant genetic component to IQ and a number of personality characteristics.  - If you could choose between having a child (via egg/sperm donor) with Donor A: an unemployed drug addict or Donor B: a Harvard law professor, which donor would you choose?  - The majority of pregnant women in America, when told that their child is likely be born with a severe birth defect, choose to abort their pregnancies.    All in all, \\"Eugenics: A Reassessment\\" is a well organized book touching on many different topics relating to eugenics.  Lynn's evidence should be carefully considered, as some of his arguments are much better supported than others.  Additionally, I would have expected this book to be more embracing of new ideas.  However, \\"Eugenics: A Reassessment\\" tracks the history of eugenics, looks at where eugenics stands today, and makes many predictions about its future.  It is an important read for anyone interested in the subject matter.	2005-10-10

The idea with these people is that their political opinions are \\"facts\\" and since they are \\"facts\\" they cannot be challenged and must be accepted as history. The agenda behind this is usually to turn history into an intellectual prop for the government and right-wing ideas. The people involved currently want to rehabilitate ideas like the crusades, the idea of \\"civilizing primative people\\" through force and the essential unchanging goodness of America. But in the end its not about history so much as it is trying to create guidelines for how history should be presented and taught. <br /> <br />The book also wants to bring a sort of morality into history.  All conflicts are to have a good side and an evil side.  Taking an example from american history, Vietnam was a \\"good\\" war done for the \\"right\\" reasons.  The vietnamese who opposed America and anyone who opposed the war in the US is therefore by definition \\"evil\\".  There can, in this view, never be two sides to a conflict.  There are only good people who must be helped and evil people who oppose them who must be destroyed.  There is good and evil in history, but overplaying morality as the book proposes leads only to turning history into national propaganda. <br /> <br />Then the author goes into the virtues of \\"old fashioned\\" ideas.  In American history, the first old fasioned idea is the civilizing mission of America on the frontier.  The book wants to go back to the days were native americans are \\"savages\\" in the way of the march of progress and civilization.  Where colonialism exists to help the inferior peoples of the world reach a higher level of civilization.  And where every history sweeps inconvenant facts under the rug to promote the goodness and virtue of the country.  Its a history of propaganda and not much more. <br /> <br />The far left and the far right are each just as bad as the other.  Each wants to take history and use it as a weapon to re-educate the broader society.  The lesson should take away is that history as an academic discipline can't really work when the people in the field (right or left) use it as a political weapon.  The conflicts the author sees are not conflicts about \\"facts\\" or \\"history\\" but political conflicts where there is no easy answer.  History as an academic subject can only work when the facts presented are accepted by the overwhelming majority of those being taught the history.	2005-10-10

A complete guide to hiking the UP would take a series of books this size, but fortunately for us Eric Hansen has done all the walking himself to find the fifty that cannot be missed.

Nancy Roberts could truly be referred to as the Queen Mother of ghost book authors for she was one of the first to publish books on the subject and over the years she has been a very prolific writer. Given her status and also the fact that it was one of her early works that turned me on to this type of book in the first place I find that I have a hard time being critical when it comes to her publications. In this case however, I am afraid that critical I must be.<br /><br />As usual Mrs. Roberts writing style is wonderful and fluid without being wordy or pretentious. This author can frankly tell a story like no other and even though the stories in this book aren't all that good, Mrs. Roberts still managed to keep me riveted. This was quite an accomplishment seeing as how I had already heard almost all of the stories in this book at least once before. She comes quite close in fact to making a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Close, but not quiet.<br /><br />I have learned over the years that Mrs. Roberts tends to produce two distinct types of ghost books. The really good ones are written after the author has traveled to the haunted sites she is writing about and has talked to people who have experienced the haunt first hand. The other types of book that she produces are basically fine examples of folklore or storytelling and nothing more. These are what I refer to as the \\"some say\\" or \\"they say\\" books because most of the stories end with a bit about how \\"They say\\" that on rainy nights you can still hear or see whatever it is the author has just written about. These types of books contain almost no recent eyewitness accounts and are just old legends handed down for generations. There is of course nothing wrong with this type of book except that they should not be sold as ghost books but should instead be marketed as folklore.<br /><br />There are a few very good stories in this book, but they are a distinct minority. The story about the modern day antics of the Bell Witch is an excellent story that includes all kinds of recent eyewitness accounts including some accounts of recent happenings from a direct descendent of old John Bell himself. This story is an example of Nancy Roberts at her best and that is the Nancy Roberts that I was looking for in this book. It is not however the Nancy Roberts that I found. I can't say that this was a bad book but I can say that she can do and has done so much better.ell Witch is an excellent story that includes all kinds of recent eyewitness accounts including some accounts of recent happenings from a direct descendent of old John Bell himself.

Eric Prentis has written The Astute Investor  for people who want to take responsibility for their own investment success.  To be astute in any field requires hard work, study, and reflection.  The book contains no magic bullets or supposedly sure -fire techniques.  Rather, it presents a good introduction to the most important investing topics.  Moreover, it also contains much advice on how to discipline one's mind and emotions in order to make wise financial decisions, as well as a thorough section on retirement planning.<br /><br />Prentis offers three sorts of information in this book.  The first sort, what I call \\"preparing the ground,\\" explains the context in which stock and bond market movements occur.  For instance, he explains how the federal government controls the monetary supply, how to understand economic indicators, how the business cycle works, and how interest rates affect the business cycle, among many other fundamental topics.  Investing without understanding these topics cannot be more than a hit or miss enterprise.  Reading through this material might be daunting for beginners, but the author explains it clearly and as painlessly as possible.<br /><br />The second type of information has to do with how to buy stocks and bonds once you understand the context of the market-you could consider this the \\"techniques\\" portion of the book.  Prentis is very much a fundamentalist-that is, he presents several methods of choosing companies to invest in based on studying their financial health, future possibilities, and style of management.  However, he doesn't neglect technical analsis, and explains some elementary chart reading techniques, including a good basic discussion of candlesticks.  He also discusses how to integrate chart reading with fundamental analysis.<br /><br />Aside from fundamental and technical analysis,  an important part of Prentis' strategy entails placing a large portion of one's portfolio in the S&P 500 Index, and he has some very persuasive arguments to support this.  For bonds, he describes the types of bonds, their risks, and at what point in the business cycle bonds are most profitable to buy.<br /><br />The third type of information involves trading psychology as well as the qualities of mind necessary to carry out investing in a rational manner.  He emphasizes that good investors tend to be lifelong learners. He also devotes an entire chapter to the contrarian mindset-that is, thinking for oneself and avoiding the herd mentality.  This is important material, as the best investors are independent-minded people who learn to manage their emotions and to work out their own way of understanding the markets.<br /><br />The Astute Investor  is an excellent guide for both beginning and more advanced investors.  The information on economics and investing techniques is thorough and provides a solid foundation for further study.  Learning to invest is a lifelong journey-there is always more to learn about the markets and about oneself.

OK, the title does indeed tell a great deal about this particular book:  However, the \\"Cisco\\" tag may be misleading.  Cisco WLAN Equipment and even some terminology is used throughout this text.  With a Vendor's badge on the cover and name in the title it prepared me for an extremely biased volume of configurations and presentations on Cisco specific technology.  This text greatly exceeded a book with that good but narrower approach.  A great plus of this particular text is the detail it provides on technology and design criteria which is applicable to WLAN security regardless of technology vendor.  It has taken the place of my best vendor agnostic text as the first reference I grab. <br /> <br />Kirshna, Sri, Andrew, and Darrin have delivered the subtitle \\"Expert guidance for securing your 802.11 networks\\" in 13 chapters.  Vast majority of their 395 pages of text and diagrams are not only applicable but extremely valuable to anyone charged with designing, implementing, and administrating WLANs in today's security conscious environment.   <br /> <br />Guidance on secure WLAN design is far more than delivery of some cookie cutter equipment configs.  The authors obviously recognized this and exceeded this reader's expectation.  Their guidance was achieved by delivering sufficient detail on all the technologies and interdependencies that are required to deliver WLAN Security.  They did not pave a single configuration which would have had too narrow an audience.  They provided the foundation which enables, even seasoned WLAN engineers, to deliver for a wide variety of business requirements.   <br /> <br />My copy has loads of dog-eared pages.  Those pages mark specific paragraphs which have been very valuable in customer and support organization presentations.   <br /> <br />If you're interested in designing secure WLAN which fits your customer's needs and performs well.   <br />Then, you should pick up a copy of this text.  <br /> <br />I'm looking for an update from these guys which includes some of the additional features and functions available in the latest \\"Cisco\\" WLAN technologies from both Aironet and Airespace teams.   <br /> <br />Great book for a WLAN designer, implementor, operator, or manager of any of those resources. <br />	2005-10-10

In fact, it is the best book I have read in terms of explaining Chinese culture as x, y, z. It is said that everything you hear about China is true, but not necessarily where you are. This book includes valuable information that is true in most locations in China, not only the coastal cities, nor just Beijing, nor only in academic circles. The book is broken into two sections. The first half of the book contains general culture information about Chinese people which should be applicable to Chinese in general, no matter where they live in the world. The second half contains information specific to Mainland China and situations you may find yourself in there.<br /><br />A poignant example would be the fact that when Chinese people are visiting you and decide it is time to leave they do just that, leave. There is no extended time of talk after an initial, \\"I need to go soon,\\" rather they just stand up and say goodbye. This surprised me the first time it happened with some students but I quickly became used to it. I have read other books which recommend against reading books like this because they will only cause more harm than good. However, almost everything in this book was relevant to my time in China and if I had read it before I went my learning curve would have been shallower.<br /><br />I would hope that they will come out with a third edition of this valuable book. A few items are dated and China is changing so rapidly that some details are sure to be very different in the future.	2005-10-10

US	50993506	R1MQEHIOHMID77	0802845975	850543828	The Protestant Face of Anglicanism	Books	1	16	34	N	Y	Theological Iconoclasm	This book is a manifesto that intends \\"to restore the distinctly Protestant face of Anglicanism\\" (7), despite the fact that Anglicanism has always understood itself as a reformed Catholicism first, its relation to continental Protestanism being depending upon the former.  Zahl's attempted restoration aims for much, for it aims at undercutting the self-understanding that Anglicans have always had (regardless of the various shades of understanding that \\"catholicity\\" has embodied in Anglicanism - as in the rest of the Church); in short, Zahl attempts a complete recreation of Anglican identity.    The sources that he argues against throughout this work are predominately secondary sources (those that he dislikes the most are almost all found in a fairly thick volume titled The Study of Anglicanism) and his arguments are largely constructed by secondary sources against one another.  Such a method reflects neither a mature nor thoughtful scholarship but, instead, a rather peurile approach to a fairly significant claim: that Anglicanism isn't what we think it is.    One must wonder: why doesn't Zahl engage classic Anglican thinkers - as well as the medieval theologians and the Church Fathers?  He seems neither to know classic Anglican thinkers such as Richard Hooker and Lancelot Andrewes nor to know that these persons built upon a legacy of 1,500 years, for any engagement with Anglican theology must be an engagement with the Church Fathers and the medieval doctors, especially St. Thomas Aquinas (who, although he does not hold the place for Anglicans that he holds for Roman Catholics, is nonetheless quite influential).  Anyone can quote secondary sources, especially when they are all contained in a single volume!  It takes a far greater and far deeper level of reading to get into the very foundation of any theological movement for the foundation is what grounds the worldview.  It means getting into theologians as well as liturgies and hymns, art and poetry.  He does none ofthis.    Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, Zahl writes that Anglicans have never done any hard theological work.  Yet, this is clearly not the case: Richard Hooker's Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity was the greatest consideration of the nature of the Church during the Reformation; the King James Bible and the Revised Standard Version are both products of Anglicanism; Archbishop William Laud was a tremendous patron of the sciences; the great Catholic \\"revivals\\" (which Zahl has a clear dislike for) in the 19th century were initiated by scholars at Oxford and Cambridge; the late 19th century Biblical and Patristic scholarship of Bishops Westcott, Lightfoot and Hort is still used today; Archbishop William Temple and Austin Ferrar were both invited to give the Gifford Lectures in their lifetimes (and the Gifford Lectures are among the most prestigious philosophical lectures in the world); Evelyn Underhill's great work Mysticism quite literally recreated the field of religious studies in the early 20th century; C. S. Lewis was one of the greatest apologists of the 20th century.  To claim that Anglicanism lacks substantive theology or that Anglicans have never done any hard theological work fails to look at the facts.    Bizarre theological assertions further injure his case.  For example, he writes that creation \\"is not the starting point of Christianity\\" (73) - a point that is hard to square with the fact that the Bible not only begins with creation, but claims that creation is good.  It is this latter point, in particular, that has historically held a very strong place in the Christian imagination.  Against heretics on the one hand, who denigrated creation (especially the body) and against philosophers on the other hand who saw creation as an accidental emanation from God, the *ethos* that the first few chapters of Genesis gives is one that flies in the face of what Zahl wants to claim.    This repudiation of the goodness of the created order continues when he writes that \\"Theworld on its own terms is no canvass for a portrait of God that is either unified of compassionate\\" (74). The Psalmic (and therefore Patristic, medieval and Anglican) notion that \\"the heavens are telling the glory of God\\" is consequently repudiated.  Yet, Christians have historically believed that in addition to the Scriptures, one could turn to \\"the book of nature\\" and see something of God revealed there as well.  Although the latter has always been subsumed to the former, it has never been absent.  To undercut creation is to undercut the God that creates - and this is no small matter!    In repudiating so much of Anglicanism then, \\"the Protestant face of Anglicanism\\" comes across as being entirely out of touch with Anglicanism's 2,000 year history.  If this work is truly intended to \\"restore\\" something, one must wonder how this is going to take place as it seems both historically uninformed and theologically violent.  This is book that restores nothing but attempts to destroy much, and will therefore cause considerable confusion.  This is a book whose outlook will eventually destroy itself.	2005-10-10

Gilpin in the lead.  It reappeared for 3 more Broadway productions.  Although O'Neill himself did not embrace the label, \\"The Emperor Jones\\" seems a quintessential expressionist piece as the little formless fears, Jeff the gambler, the convicts and the auctioneer all seem to be projected from Jones' deteriorating inner emotions.  The opening scene between Jones and Smithers, the Cockney trader, is powerful with the brutal dialogue & interplay between characters.  The next 6 scenes all reflect Jones' inner state with the tremendous mechanism of the increasingly intense tom-tom drums driving him to the breaking point and his increasingly tattered clothing reflecting how he is being worn down.  Demonstrating the expressionist technique, frequently at the conclusion of these scenes the forest seems to draw around Jones after he shoots his revolver at his illusion.  Scenic designer Cleon Throckmorton broke new ground by using a plaster skydome in place of the traditional canvas cyclorama to enhance the outdoor visual effects, which would be a challenge to produce.  The play climaxes offstage in Scene 8 as Jones is cornered and executed.  The play shows us an island on the edge of civilization where local dictators can use muscle to loot the public treasury for personal gain as they create and evade their own laws.  The sad universality of the piece is that 85 years after its first production, whether you call them Taliban, Castro or Saddam Hussein, we can still see places in the world where similar dramas of dictatorship are played with various ethnicities and geography.  The savagery of O'Neill's Emperor Jones may seem different; but from Croatia to Korea, it still exists in many places.  This is a play that still resonates thematically and dramatically.

This is the Portuguese text edition of \\"In the Heart of the Sea\\",  a first rate, well crafted work of non-fiction. The author has a gift for putting together a compelling narrative about the unusual ordeal of the whale ship, Essex, which sailed out of Nantucket and was done in on the high seas by an extremely aggressive sperm whale who attacked it. So complete was the damage that the ship sank, its crew of twenty cast adrift upon a seemingly infinite ocean to find their way back home in three small boats. This real life, unheard of attack by a whale was the basis for Herman Melville's classic work of fiction, \\"Moby Dick\\".<br /><br />What the author does is ground what happened to these most unfortunate of men in the historical context of the time. He paints a picture of the milieu in which they lived. Their lives were governed entirely by the whaling industry that was the bread and butter for Nantucket Island, the whaling capital of the world.<br /><br />Drawing upon narratives by some of the survivors, as well as other historical data, he paints in intricate detail what life must have been like for these men. He weaves a tapestry of early nineteenth century life on the island of Nantucket and the preeminence of whaling in the lives of those who lived there, as well as the role of the Quakers. In essence, he brings the men, who were involved in this most notorious of survival at sea stories, to life for the reader.<br /><br />It is a balanced narrative. This was to be the first voyage as Captain for the democratic George Pollard, who was teamed up with a very aggressive and ambitious first mate, Owen Chase. This was later to prove to be a poor combination. Nearly a third of the crew was African-American, which was an interesting twist, arising out of the abolitionist views of the Quakers, whose views were the mainstay of Nantucket. Most of the crew was very young, the cabin boy, Thomas Nickerson, being but fourteen years of age.<br /><br />When the Essex was attacked while on the high seas by a gigantic, aggressive sperm whale and destroyed in the process, the story of the what happened to the crew makes for one of the most engrossing and amazing stories of survival ever to be told. Against the odds, eight of them survived their ordeal, which lasted for months. Dehydration and starvation were to drive them to  a new frontier of human behavior. That threshold, however, once crossed, was one that would forever haunt those who survived. Their agonizing journey and foray into anthropophagy is chillingly chronicled.<br /><br />This is a riveting and triumphant book.

It was just the latest disaster in less than a decade to afflict what I thought was my cursed native state: The Silver Bridge collapse, the explosion at the Farmington No. 9 mine and the Marshall University plane crash. <br /> <br />This book is in three parts, the first describing the disaster, the second a historical overview of Appalachia in general and the Buffalo Creek area in particular. The third is on the effects on the survivors of the flood. <br /> <br />Though the Buffalo Creek flood happened more than 30 years ago, its lessons are as current as the destruction of New Orleans. <br /> <br />Kai Erickson writes quite well for a sociologist and the book only begins to drag a bit at the end, in the sociology part. Maybe it's just the (justifiable) litany of complaints from the survivors. If this account is any measure, the survivors of Hurricane Katrina will be suffering in psyche long after their material losses have been recouped. <br /> <br />Anyone with further interest in the Buffalo Creek flood ought to also read Gerald Stern's \\"The Buffalo Creek Disaster,\\" written from the point of view of one of the lawyers who took part in the resulting litigation.	2005-10-10

I am pasting this review that i had originally posted in 2001 at other websites.<br /><br />This is one of the best books i have read. I have several years of experience in C/C++ and some experience in windows programming however I am a 'absolute beginner' with Windows device drivers and kernel mode programming and i was able to grasp almost everything the book spoke about with relative ease and with NO confusions. I would recommend this book to anyone who has absolutely no background in device driver programming but wants to make a career doing just that. I must admit that the books assumes that you are versed with C/C++ and some understanding of programming paradigm for windows, but it is pretty obvious since this is NOT a book to teach a programming language nor it is aimed at teaching regular windows programming. It is a complete 'NO NONSENSE' book that deals with topics right upto the point. The contents of the book flow gracefully explaining each and every step with precise detail. The author seems to have made the best possible effort to explain the basics before jumping directly into details. And that does help an absolute beginner. This book does NOT cover details about device specific drivers but it does help you reach a point where you are confident that 'you will understand' whatever you research on your own. A very good book... have seen very few of these types lately.	2005-10-10

It is a wonderful book and the woman who wrote it is so deserving of our respect and praise.  To quote someone who says it all, Janisse Ray said  \\"something I took for granted has come alive, because I have been given its story.  After reading this book, I took a magnifying glass outside and pored over the tree trunks.  I have seen Robin Kimmerer's miniature landscape for myself.  Yet, this is so much more than a book about mosses.  This is a Native American woman speaking.  This is a mother's story.  This is a science revealed through human psyche.  Robin Kimmerer is a scientist who combines empiricism with all other forms of knowing.  Hers is a spectacularly different view of the world and her voice needs to be heard.\\"<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book.	2005-10-10

I believe that in anything there is a positive. As we all walk our own path in life we encounter people who cross our paths. It is up to us to learn from them. We are all trying to reach the same top of the mountain (whatever our beliefs might be). There is no need to be negative about anything...whether it be religion, politics, anything. We all need positivity. All of the people born into this world has a purpose. We are all born with needs: Validation, Worth, Happiness, and Peace. That is what we should strive for. The world itself is already full of turmoil. We all have a responsibility to bring in more positivity. If we can learn even 1% from something on how to be more positive, then we are on the right frame of mind. We need not tell the other person their path is wrong or right. Because our path is not necessarily their path (vice-versa). I hope that my review is taken in with open-mindedness. May your life be at peace and get better everyday, in everyway.	2005-10-10

Teach Me to Stand: A Devotional Study on Spiritual Victory	Books	4	17	18	N	N	Very good guide on spiritual warfare	Kay Arthur deftly tackles a topic that not all churches and ministers will discuss: spiritual warfare. That this warfare is all around us, in many of the day-to-day situations we face, is a fact, and Arthur draws constantly and completely from Scripture to arm her reader for battle. The book, which is designed to be an 11-week study but can be read at your own pace, offers daily readings. Most days require the reader to look up and examine more closely specific Scriptural verses. Arthur does a good job of digging into the \\"evidence\\" in God's Word for points that she makes; everything is adequately supported in Scripture. What we found most interesting were the real-life stories she quotes from people she's known. Some are rather disturbing, but we must open our eyes to them.	2005-10-10

We humans see ourselves as rational beings with manners and ethics, while apes are fundamentally different creatures that behave like -- well -- animals.<br /><br />Emory University Primatologist Frans de Waal would not agree. If we really want to understand what makes us human, de Waal argues in Our Inner Ape, we should not focus on our differences with apes, but rather examine the \\"fascinating and frightening parallels between primate behavior and our own, with equal regard for the good, the bad, and the ugly.\\"<br /><br />That is precisely what he does in the book, with a wealth of stories and an entertaining style that does not sacrifice scientific depth or objectivity. He focuses on chimpanzees and bonobos because they are closest to humans, sharing a common ancestor as recently as 5.5 million years ago.<br /><br />A 1000-word review of Our Inner Ape, including an opening limerick, is available at my Science Shelf online book review archive.	2005-10-10

It is also an expose of how statistical information can be exagerrated in the name of a cause.  Damned Lies and Statistics succeeds fairly well at both those tasks. <br /> <br />...And yet, having been through a few courses on statistics in college, I found a great deal of the book was already known to me.  This, in and of itself, is not an issue; however, I was somewhat disappointed by the author's analysis of the motives of those who would abuse statistical techniques.  I think the book would have benefited from more examples to illustrate his points.  After finishing I was left wanting more.  I suppose that's why he wrote a followup to this book (More Damned Lies and STatistics). <br /> <br />I would recommend this book only to people with very limited knowledge of statistics.  If you use statistics regularly or have taken a course or two on the subject, you'll quickly become bored with this.	2005-10-10

A fascinating, deadly, frightening, solemn, lesson-worthy book about scuba diving, its dangers and appeal.  I am a scuba diver who is extremely conservative and would never dream of diving to the depth these people had to dive to bring up china and other artifacts from the sunken Andrea Doria.  I am in awe of the bravery and expertise that it takes to do such a deep and complicated wreck dive, but I was also very well warned that, even the best divers, with hundreds of dives to their credit, ended up dead diving this wreck.  The Andrea Doria has captured the imagination of many divers.  It was heartbreaking and frightening to see how quickly good, practised divers lost their lives in their pursuit of \\"knicknacks\\".

Unfortunately, Wickett's Remedy is clever at best. (I can't speak of the whole book, only of the first several chapters which I read). The main character Lydia seems strangely passive and passionless in response to her suitor's odd but successful courtship. The tone faintly suggests, \\"She is just a character in a novel\\"; everything seems like a clever device, or an opening for a clever device. The prose is somewhat belabored.

In general, I have always liked Trillin, but some of his humor pieces can be a little too cute.  These essays, which originally appeared in the New Yorker, are very spare and moving.  Each tells the story of a person killed--by accident, by murder, by abuse--and each essay is absorbing, melancholy and invested with meaning.  The format makes the book an easy one to read and a good one for when you do not have a lot of time to read: each essay stands on its own.  I have read this book at least twice in its entirety and some of the essays several times.  The writing is skilled and precise.  Trillin never lapses into sanctimony or sentimentality.  I have recommended this book to many, and actually ended up loaning my copy to someone who liked it so much he wouldn't give it back!

The authors, a husband and wife team, were Moscow bureau chiefs for the Washington Post in Russia  from January 2001 to November 2004 and their reporting background shows through as they thoroughly footnoted and referenced their facts throughout the book. <br /> <br />It does not paint a pretty picture of a country that has been dominated by a brutal state centered government most of last century and Czarist regimes prior to that. After reading this portrayal of an increasing dominance once again of the State over the people and how the State totally controls the media; the court system; the educational system; the elections; and any potential voices of opposition I finished the book with a more profound appreciation of what our founding fathers intended to do with the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights. <br /> <br />Personally, I think this book should be read by any American who doesn't undertand the crushing effect that a State dominated government has upon the common person and then keep their eyes open to the legislation and powers being increasingly granted to our Federal Government under the guise of protecting us against terrorism. The fact that Bush and Putin are friends becomes clear when you realize that they both share the same goal of increased power to the Central Government giving them a basic common belief system. <br /> <br />The book itself makes it clear that such a scenario paints a very bleak and oppressive way of life for the average citizen under a State dominated regime which is reflected in the fact that Russia has the 2nd highest suicide rate in the world. <br /> <br />As Baker and Glasser point out, the former KGB Putin was a relative unknown and was basically manipulated into office through a state controlled media and political strong arm tactics after Yeltsin chose him as his successor (Or was it that Yeltsin had no choice himself?). Once into office Putin has consolidated the power of the State and Kremlin at the expense of the people's freedoms under what he calls \\"controlled Democracy\\". <br /> <br />In the chapter \\"Scam of the Year\\", Baker and Glasser detail how Putin and his cadre of siloviki (former military and KGB officers)stole Mikhail Kodorkovsky's Yukos Oil (Russia's largest oil company and Russia's richest man) and manipulated it to State control using trumped up and exaggerated tax evasion charges. Khodorkovsky's real sin was open resistance to Putin and the increasing State dominance after a brief period of free marketism under Yeltsin. <br /> <br />All in all, a good and realistic account of why governments should have limited powers and influence over private citizens lives although I don't think this is the message the author's intended. I would suggest that anyone leaning towards a Socialist form of government read this book and take heed. It doesn't work and this book makes it clear why (although again I don't think it was written to convey that message). <br /> <br />By the way, all of this return to State dominance in Russia was predicted in the 80's and early 90's by a former long time KGB higher up, Anatoliy Golitsyn, in his books New Lies for Old and The Perestroika Deception. Golitsyn sat in on the planning of this illusion of Russia's conversion to \\"Democracy\\" and acts as a fly on the wall to the insider deceptions which ensued. I would also recommend these books to those seeking the truth about how things work which we rarely, if ever, are given.	2005-10-10

I joined Amway in college.  I'm a natural salesperson, and it was easy for me to make money selling the products to a captive audience of desperate dormmates.  I sold the products out of the the trunk of my car.  It was easy and fun, and I was making about $100 a week on it.  My upline was flipping out.  I was an unrepenting atheist, a very liberal Democrat, a flagrant feminist, and I refused to recruit new sales people.  I just wanted to make extra money while I was in school.  The more money I made, the more upset they became.  When I refused to buy their right-wing political and religious nonsense, they became incensed.  Finally, I was told to either shape up or they would refuse to fill my orders.  I quit.  They flipped out again.  I finally got away from them by going home between semesters.  The wing-nuts finally gave up.  Stay away from them.  They are controlling cultists who can't take NO for answer.	2005-10-10

It's one that every Christian should read and mull over.<br /><br />I think one point in the book that I would adjust is his teaching on imagining God. He assumes that because God's throne is described in Revelations 4 and Ezekiel 1 that we must therefore be able to imagine God in our minds.  He doesn't deal with the concept that God may have given us these descriptions without intending for us to create paintings of God on the easel of our own minds. He teaches that people should use Revelation 4 and Ezekiel 1 throne room scenes to imagine what God looks like.  Then pray to the image in your mind. This extra-biblical concept can lead one to create an image in their mind of what God is like...when in reality  it is an image in their mind...it isn't God. Don't do that. Let God reveal himself to you through real visions, not images you create in your own mind. Ask God to reveal Himself to you instead through a direct experience rather than creating something in your mind.<br /><br />If the experiences you have with God match with the bible, then you will have a powerful confirmation of your encounter with the Lord.<br /><br />Mike Bickle is an excellent man.  His life has helped countless people, including myself.  He was my pastor for years...and a neighbor.  Now that I'm a pastor, I can see that I would not be in the ministry if it were not for Mike's inspiration to seek Jesus and it's profound effect on my life.  That is the key emphasis in this book...and if you open your heart to Jesus while reading this book you will be changed.<br /><br />Mike is well known for inspiring people to seek Jesus.  And this is the first book he published along that line.  It really is a classic even though it's only been out for maybe ten years or so. So even though I have a concern about one teaching in this book, the overall book is tremendous.<br /><br />Every Christian should own a copy and read it at least once or twice.  I heartily recommend you buy a copy-and an extra one for giving out to friends.  Just add my footnote in there if you agree with me on that one point.<br /><br />Grace...-and an extra one for giving out to friends.

I figured the contestants on the biggest loser did alot more then Jillian's book recommends, but my girlfriend stuck to the program in Jillian's book to the letter and her \\"before\\" and \\"after\\" photos thus far look as good if not better than some on the female contestants. <br /> <br />I just finished my 4th week on Jillian's program and I am pleasantly surprised at my ability to stick with it! You have to be committed in order to maintain the 4 times a week workout, but they are not so grueling that you dread them.  I strongly recommend taking a before picture and then doing so every two weeks. PICTURES DONT LIE! And seeing the results goes a long way to keeping you motivated!  <br /> <br />I have tried both Atkins and South Beach diet and have lost weight ( and a pant size) on both. But at the end of the first month or so, I had gotten to my goal weight and definately looked thinner but was still \\"soft\\" in appearance and ultimately I ended up putting the weight back on. I like this plan alot better since it helped me create a healthy way to eat that I can stick with for the rest of my life. <br /> <br />One caution, however, is the weights required. You do need to invest in some type of equipment or gym membership. Otherwise it is hard to do her workouts- which is  one of her three keys to the fantastic results.	2005-10-10

I first got acquainted with Dubrovin/Novikov/Fomenko collection when I was still a second year (sophomore in the US system) student in Math-Phys  trying to learn the basics on plane/space differential curves as a  complement for my Calculus courses. And since then I've made countless references to this book and its siblings.    The pace is fast compared to  other well known introductions on differential geometry/topology  but the text has many insightful and non-trivial examples  examples. Challenging problems are present everywhere in the text!  Though there are a few problems per chapter, the problems sometimes really  require some mastery of the material being far from immediate  applications of the theory developed(for the joy or despair of the  reader). Intentionally the authors try, whenever possible, to replace calculations and  difficult deductions with conceptual proofs. Frequent links with  physical theories (e.g. mechanics, electromagnetism, general  relativity, field theory etc.) compound a good deal of the text  which makes its reading still more delightful. As a con, I would  say the text is quite hard for a beginner but stubborness pays-off in this case.  The second volume of this series covers differential topology w/ emphasis on many aspects of modern physics, like GR, solitons and Yang-Mills theory. There's also a nice account on complex manifolds, mainly Riemman surfaces and it's relation to Abel's thm. Among other topics: classification of compact surfaces , hyperbolic geometry etc.  The third volume covers Homology theory and included a readable account of Spectral sequences for those who may need to learn the machinery for qualifications exams and or applications of complex geometry to contemporary physics (e.g. twistor theory). Viktor Prasolov has recently published a treatise on Homology with more problems and more rigorous proofs. A nice complement to Novikov's exposition.

Each chapter gives a brief (as in 10 page) summary of some of the skills you may need and some of the questions you may encounter.  However, the list of skills and techniques is by no means comprehensive (and I personally found the recommended techniques for logic games very inefficient and confusing compared to every other technique for logic games that I've tried), so if you are looking for a \\"How to\\" approach to the LSAT, this book is not your best bet (I recommend Nova's Master the LSAT book instead).  On the other hand, it does gives you some succinct tips, and works great if you are trying to cram in some studying in the month before the test.<br /><br />The book comes with a CD that \\"features sample test questions and an audio presentation of chapter concepts.\\"  The audio presentation of chapter concepts is nothing more than the author reading exactly what he wrote in the chapter (with maybe a few words different, I followed along in the book as the audio played just to see!).  The sample test questions are not worth it at all.  The program is called ExamForce CramMaster and I first thought that it would give me a wide variety of questions to practice on so that I would improve.  The program tells you that it will give you new questions based on how you answered an old one and that it will help you improve in areas where you need it most.  It might work a little bit like that, but mostly it gives you the same questions over and over again so that you can ace the section because you've memorized the answers and don't even need to read the question or answer choices anymore!<br /><br />As for the practice exams in the book itself, there is no score conversion table so you only know which questions you got wrong, not how you would have scored on a real LSAT.  The explanations of answers are good, although the answer key tends to be wrong.  The list of answers will give one answer for a question, while the explanation gives another, and usually the correct, answer.  I found the logical reasoning practice questions very useful, and the logic games questions were okay, but the reading comprehension passages were nothing like what you would get on a real LSAT.  The passages were actually interesting and fun to read, sometimes excerpts from novels or short stories, and did not give any indication of what the reading passages are actually like.  A better set of practice exams would be the old LSAT exams published by LSAC, even though you don't get detailed explanations.<br /><br />While the questions were perhaps wittily written, I think most people would agree that taking tests most like the LSAT are the best way to prepare for test day.  I thought this book was quite helpful as a review of general techniques, and as practice for the logical reasoning sections, but there is no way that I would recommend this as the only book you buy to study for the LSAT.give one answer for a question, while the explanation gives another, and usually the correct, answer.

It collects forty interviews from the entire run of Guitar Player Magazine, and you're more than likely to find your favorite players in here, since over the years the magazine interviewed the leading guitarists from the full spectrum of styles; in this book you'll find interviews with the greats of classic rock and blues rock like Jeff Beck, Duane Allman, Jimmy Page, David Gilmour, Eric Clapton and George Harrison; more modern players like The Edge and Billy Gibbons; rock n' roll pioneers like Chuck Berry and Carl Perkins; solo virtuosos like Steve Vai, Joe Satiriani and Yngwie Malmsteen; masters of country music Chet Atkins and Les Paul; some jazz greats like Wes Montgomery, Pet Metheny and John McLaughlin; masters like Frank Zappa, Jimi Hendrix, Mark Knopfler and Jerry Garcia; and even classical guitar genius Andres Segovia. There are even a few surprising, less widely appreciated masters like acoustic master Michael Hedges; funk/jazz/rocker Vernon Reid of Living Color; and The Police's Andy Summers, a fantastic and little appreciated fusion musician by his own right. Only a few major names are missing, notable ones including Brian May, Prince and Ritchie Blackmore. <br /> <br />Each of these master musicians offers here insight into his music, into his style, technique, and his very approach to the guitar, his playing methods, his compositions and his take on the guitar as an instrument and as a concept, and often into his personality and personal history as well. It's a fascinating read for any guitar player (especially those in the rock/blues vein) as well as for any music lover, though they may not get as much from it as those with a professional interest, who's bound to get some interesting notions and ideas, as well as lots of useful practical advice. That makes it both a great read and an immense well of knowledge for players. Secrets from the Masters is a perfect giftbook for guitar players and guitar aficionados, an unsurpassable book that will earn an honorary place on your bookshelf. Guitar players - Secrets from the Masters is not to be missed.	2005-10-10

Possibly an important book.  Personally, even as a mom, I hadn't given pornography much thought.  Who knew that I should have.  Apparently since I was a child, the porn industry has blossomed from a simple Penthouse/Hustler/Playboy kind of thing into this huge multi-billion dollar industry (yes, BILLION).<br /><br />An industry so large and economically effective that it is managing to draw in more traditional media.

After all, what does Pamela Anderson and Paris Hilton  have in common.  Give up... sex tape exposure that made them super stars for the under 20 age group.<br /><br />But before you put this book down because it sounds like it's going to be coming from a frothing `puritan' or feminist, don't.  This is, in fact, a very adult/mature book that doesn't stop from describing in detail what `acts' the interviewees are talking about.  Neither does it stifle the language by asterisks or whatever @$%$#*.

Eichelman	I think your the one who's showing bigotry and bias.  \\"If Harry Turtledove doesn't have room for Jesus Christ I don't have room for Harry Turtledove\\" come on xtian you can do better than that. <br /> <br />Your arguments are circular and your logic is appalling.  If people who don't write Jesus into their stories are \\"afraid\\" of showing a world \\"as it could be under\\" him then are authors who do adopt a xtian viewpoint afraid of showing a world as it could be without him? <br /> <br />Your review has nothing to do with the book and is just blatant fungelical propaganda.  Jesus doesn't belong in Turtledove's work because its about the real world, not the one your familar with where donkey's can talk, people can fly, and a man named Jesus lives up in the sky.  This is a great book that continues a great series and gives us a look at a world we may have narrowly missed having.  Even if you disagree with that you can't argue that Turtledove is one hell of a good writer and this book is a fine adventure.	2005-10-10

It is answered in chapter 5, page 27 and the answer is 1 or 2 drops twice daily for 3 to 5 months, and then regularly at a lower dose long-term. This I presume means life, after all, as is explained, one can't expect a condition such as senile cataract, which is caused by declining anti-oxidants and increasing glycosylation (cross-linking) to improve with age. Therefore it is necessary to \\"top-up\\" and use these kinds of preventative measures to ensure that the cataract does not reappear, for as we age its condition is accerlerated. I for one am very pleased that there is now an option such as eye-drops for this condition, and Dr. Kyriazis does explain all the ins-and-outs of quality assurance etc. I would have liked more detail, but there is still lots of good information contained within.	2005-10-10

He's not afraid to ask profound questions, and somehow (and here's the great trick of his writing) we feel as though we're part of the discovery of answers. Get this book.

He clearly knows what science is, and nicely explains how science isn't simply a collection of data, but a way of explaining things and placing the data within the larger context of tested theories that provide added insight into how the world works.  <br /> <br />The war on science is, naturally enough, a war on the method of science and the institutions used to advance scientific knowledge.  Mooney begins his book by describing the republican war on science from an historical background.  The party hasn't always been anti-science.  Many early members of the party (even Richard Nixon) were actually moderates on the subject, and showed a certain deference to science, even when it didn't fit the party line. <br /> <br />The republican war on science began in earnest with the marriage of two key groups; business and conservative Christians (including fringe groups like the Mormons).  This marriage resulted in the perfect political storm because business groups had/have plenty of money with which to corrupt the political process, while Christian groups are willing to barter economic, health, and environmental issues in return for the right to use the government as a vehicle for imposing their religious ideology on American society.   <br /> <br />Some of the techniques used by republicans in their war on science include: <br /> <br />1)  Over emphasize scientific uncertainty, creating the illusion of a controversy where none exists within the scientific community <br />2)  Demand \\"peer review\\" by industry-friendly scientists who have a financial links with their political sponsors <br />3)  Eliminate non-partisan sources for scientific advice to Congress.  Replace them witha process beholden to politics and business interests (politicizing science) <br />4)  Give the illusion of supporting science (while simultaneously degrading it) by using propaganda with phrases like \\"sound science,\\" \\"junk science,\\" etc.   <br />5)  Establish \\"think tanks\\" staffed by cherry-picked industry-friendly scientists.  Demand that these think tanks have equal time with non-partisan scientific institutions. <br /> <br />The propaganda component caught my eye, harkening back to my youth as a devout Mormon where I was taught that there will never be a conflict between \\"true religion\\" and \\"true science.\\"  I was assured that any disagreements between science and Mormonism (like evolution and the origin of the ancient Americans) could happen only with \\"junk science,\\" or the \\"wisdom of men,\\" because (by definition) \\"true science\\" never disagrees with \\"the gospel.\\"   <br /> <br />With GOP propaganda sound bites like \\"sound science,\\" I immediately suspected a Mormon connection.  Sure enough, I found that Chris Cannon, leader of the \\"Sound Science Caucus\\" in the House, and representative from Utah, is a BYU-educated and highly regarded member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). <br /> <br />Most alarmingly, the Republican war on science is often linked to issues that have the capacity to greatly impact public health and the environment.  A few examples touched by Mooney include: <br /> <br />1)  Global warming <br />2)  Salmon extinction/recovery <br />3)  Depletion of the ozone layer <br />4)  Teaching religion (creationism/Intelligent design) in science classes <br />5)  Limiting access to, and misrepresenting the science of, reproductive science <br />6)  Acid rain <br />7)  Mercury poison in the environment <br />8)  Risks from carcinogens such as smoking and asbestos. <br />9)  Star wars   <br /> <br />Recent examples of heightened hurricane strength (predicted by global warming models) are just a small taste of the future cost the world will pay as a result of the GOP war on the science of earth's climate.  <br /> <br />Mooney points out that it's not just Republicans who are abusing science.  Democrats and liberals are guilty, too.  The difference is in degree and tenacity, where the GOP wins, hands down.  Still, I think Mooney should have been a bit tougher on liberals.  Their ideologically driven opposition to nuclear energy certainly has exacerbated the problem with global warming.  And the recent falloff in gas-guzzling SUVs, as the price of gasoline has risen, illustrates the absurdity of some liberals who insist on mandating mileage standards to the exclusion of using higher energy taxes to encourage conservation by making energy more expensive. <br /> <br />At its root the war on science involves intellectual dishonesty and distain for scientific evidence.  Because of this, I was a little surprised that Mooney didn't delve into the obvious repercussions that reach beyond issues strictly related to science.  For example, intellectual dishonesty, distain for evidence, and ideology were essential tools used by the Bush administration in unilaterally misleading the nation to war in Iraq.     <br /> <br />Another shortcoming in Mooney's book is that he doesn't give enough time to the issue of game theory.   Science and policy always meet at an interface, and Mooney too often gives the impression that science doesn't give guidance on how to establish wise policy using scientific evidence.  Mathematicians, though, developed the tools to do it, in the branch of mathematics called game theory.  If politicians were better versed in how to logically weigh evidence and uncertainty, it would go a long way toward mitigating the damage that's being done by the ideologues currently running the government.  <br /> <br />The issue of global warming is a good example because the consequences are immense, far exceeding the economic cost of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases sufficient to stabilizethe climate.  Republicans, though, (led by George W. Bush) argue that we shouldn't take action because there is uncertainty about global warming. When in fact, using the mathematics of game theory, we see that it's precisely *because* of uncertainty that we must act at once.  With so much at stake, we dare not gamble with earth's future.   <br /> <br />With issues like the threatened bird flu pandemic, global warming and energy shortages facing the nation, we simply cannot afford to be led by religious ideologues bent on abusing science for political/religious purposes.  For citizens who care about America's future, and the world, this is a book you simply can't afford not to read. <br />	2005-10-10

Landsburg does this in an informative and entertaining way but overall he treats liberals more roughly than conservatives.  There have been times when liberals seemed more ignorant of economics than conservatives but that does not explain why conservatives get off so easily in this book.  Landsburg simply prefers examples that fit his political agenda.  Sadly, readers will have no idea that the examples were choosen based on their political value as well as their pedagogic value. <br /> <br />Still, this book is entertaining, clearly written and teaches important material.  If not for the political bias I would give it five stars.	2005-10-10

I do think that the first book had more plot then this one though.  It seems that there isn't as much going on in this book, but there really is.  The detail of all the events seems to be more developed here.  I think Lyra is complimented very nicely by Will Parry as well.  I think Will is actually a much more interesting character since he seems to be linked more to what is going on than Lyra is(atleast for now).  The story starts off with Will and talks about how he must find his father.  We learn how his father is connected to things that Lyra knows.  Will and Lyra don't know that they have any connection at all which makes their relationship even more exciting.  I liked the little adventures they go on as they bounce back and forth from world to world.  The revelations in this book are truely cool, not so much the ending but what happens with the scientist.  You really should read this one if you liked the first.  Pullman just has a way of writing that seems to really put you in another place.  The reason I say this is because I always have trouble remembering what the characters did because I almost feel like I experienced what they did.  I am going to continue the series now and hope the next one is as good as the first two and I suggest you do the same.	2005-10-10

If you like your thrillers in the form of international espionage then Brad Thor's latest book may be the next good read for you.  If waiting a year or more, is too long a time for you to learn how Dirk Pitt has saved the whole world from destruction yet again, then Brad Thor has a larger than life hero who might be just the intermediate fix you need!  Welcome Scot Harvath!    Like all good thrillers, in Blowback Thor gives us a hero (protagonist) with a serious problem. This would be Scot Harvath, ex-seal, ex-secret service agent, and intrepid patriot.  You don't have to wait long to figure out what the problem is, the actions starts in the first couple pages of the book, and the problem is not limited to just one big problem, there are all sorts of tangential issues to worry about as well.  And again, like all good thrillers, the more our hero tries to solve the problem the worse the problem becomes. Harvath has all the skills and talents you would expect from someone with his background, but incredibly as soon as one bad guy gets eliminated, we learn that he was just a front for another much \\"badder\\" guy.      Blowback has Harvath in search of an evil genius who has figured out how to spread a plague around the world that will kill all but the most faithful Islamic extremists. While good guy Harvath has a lot of allies (no surprise, he teams up with a really smart, great looking woman), time is certainly working against him. As the story races to the big confrontation you will be treated to spectacular scenery, impregnable fortresses, lots of destruction, and you definitely won't be disappointed with the conclusion.      Brad Thor makes great use of current events and many of the characters are real life people/politicians with their names changed (presumably to protect the innocent).  Thor serves up a great rendition of Hillary Rodham Clinton Rodham.  Of course \\"great\\" really depends on which side of the fence you sit!  In the end Brad Thor ties up all the loseends and leaves the reader satisfied but anxious for the next story!  It is just fiction, but escapist fiction in the most enjoyable sense.    Highest recommendation for captivating, up all night reading.	2005-10-10

It starts with his religious convictions as a devout Catholic, but then slowly transforms into a fetish.  However, as a reader, this \\"slow transformation\\" is a jolting transition for the reader.<br /><br />His fetish drives his wife from his life, only to seek refuge in the \\"church\\" of an evil being known as Yakut.  Yakut helps Jonathan kill and dispose of his wife and blame the murder on a hapless motel employee.<br /><br />But obviously things don't end there for the cannibal.  Jonathan is haunted by Yakut.  Yakut goes after the Jonathan's mother, which prompts the cannibal, who is remorseful for the death of his wife, begins to stalk the entity, which leads to a warped showdown between the two.<br /><br />This novel has only one developed character.  The others seem to be drawn merely to show Jonathan's complex character.  I did think Jonathan's character was sympathetic only at the beginning and close to the end.  The plot was very simplistic, but did a good job of the Man vs Man/Demon genre of storytelling.<br /><br />I did think there was a lot of strong writing prowess in the story, so I am sure that Mary Ann Mitchell is a good writer.  I just picked the wrong book.	2005-10-10

His relationship with his wife, though she is peripheral as a character, is interestingly drawn. They have 2 sons, Danny, who we figure and later discover is gay and who is the \\"good son,\\" and Pete, the wild one. That easy stereotype bothered me.<br /><br />A good re-thinking and re-doing of this story could have made it great. The quiet desperation throughout the novel is not particularly unique, especially for literary fiction. It is only a \\"gay\\" novel because the murder victim is an effeminate gay teen and Danny is gay. That theme simply feels applied artifically to the story. This is actually a novel about the father.<br /><br />Also, why the 1970s? There were a few weak references to the times, and the murder of a tormented gay teen could easily still happen these days. To me, if an author picks an era to portray, there had better be a good reason.<br /><br />The story is not 100 percent dull, but the characters of the two sons and their eventual closeness is by far the most interesting aspect of the story. The murder aspects felt like an editor or someone suggested to \\"beef up\\" the story. The father going into the police station to find out more details now & again almost felt like a cookie-cutter mystery that had been cut-and-pasted into a literary read. And the endless details of who was where, and who really did it, and not rendered as a surprise, and you will probably find you don't care much.<br /><br />The climax? A disappointment. While Danny's thoughts at the story's resolution are rich and good, the ending \\"incident\\" feels like someone rubber-stamped the manuscript, \\"Put climax to the story here and make it dramatic.\\"<br /><br />There are many other better books out there. Don't get this if you're looking for a gay-themed novel, because you'll be disappointed. But if you like literary novels about family life, this might suit you.here.

He's advertised for a live-in nurse so he can bring his father home to die, but so far he's had no luck. As he talks it's easy to see why. He's a man too used to his own unwanted company. He's abrupt and blunt, with no social skills.<br /><br />As he talked, \\"He looked around his house at the piles of clutter and filthy dishes....When he hung up, he looked at the mess again, seeing it in a different light, now that someone was actually coming.\\" He worked for three days clearing \\"decades\\" of accumulation, but it wasn't until the prospective nurse arrived that he realized he hadn't cleaned.<br /><br />\\"The house wasn't cluttered now; it was sparse. He'd purged it of trash and memories alike, as if there was no distinction. But he hadn't scrubbed anything. And now, as she approached, he saw the dust, the grit, the coating of neglect on everything.\\"<br /><br />But Mattie Holden, a city girl from Spokane in her mid-30s, takes the job, and moves in immediately. Too relieved to question his luck, Chas quickly moves his father home and Mattie settles in to a lot more of the cleaning and cooking than she'd planned on. Chas' father is helpless and unresponsive, in the last stages of Parkinson's.<br /><br />But there's an aura of strength about him, a presence that grows increasingly ominous. \\"He just seems bigger than he is,\\" Mattie tells Chas. \\"When I turn my head I have this sense that he's enormous. It sounds crazy.\\"<br /><br />Chas, grudgingly attempting to co-exist, tells her how his father once killed a bobcat with his own hands. \\"Illness can't diminish a man like that.\\" Slowly, haltingly, Chas reveals more.  His mother ran away when he was 10; his big, powerful sheep-ranching father was a preacher with rigid, unforgiving standards. Chas himself is gruff and hard drinking, but thinks of himself as a man who didn't live up to anyone's standards, even his own.<br /><br />Chas is a complex character, a man who looks just like his father but has none of the old man's rigidity. It doesn't take him long to realize Mattie has secrets, but he doesn't pry. When a valued customer, the only Muslim family in town, can't afford to buy the traditional lamb before Eid, Chas leaves one tethered to their porch and then denies having done so. He refuses to sign a petition banning Christmas trappings from the local school because, he says, it will only give bigots an excuse to lash out at the non-Christians.<br /><br />A few days later the Muslim family's house is torched and Chas is accused of the crime. The sheriff, an outsider, assumes there must be something to it if everyone in town is convinced Chas is guilty.<br /><br />Meanwhile Mattie is having more and more trouble sleeping, convinced Chas' father is haunting her, that he sees into the deepest recesses of her soul and her less than proud past. And maybe there's something to that. Most of Sweetwater thinks he has uncanny powers and hates him for it too, willing to visit all the old man's unforgiving destruction on the son.<br /><br />The town's near-universal willingness to come together in hatred would seem far-fetched if it didn't happen so often in real life. Sharfeddin does a good job of portraying small town insularity and mutual reinforcement and builds the novel to a complex, layered conclusion.<br /><br />Described in the jacket copy as a \\"contemporary Western,\\" \\"Blackbelly\\" has all the elements: the whisky-drinking, principled, misunderstood loner; the troubled, secretive woman who draws him out, and the evil of lesser men, which threatens to destroy his life. But Sharfeddin's treatment of these elements makes them real, with shades of ambiguity throughout, conflicts not easily settledand no simple resolution. A bit battered by life, Mattie and Chas have learned from their mistakes and flaws (Chas more than Mattie), but not overcome them.<br /><br />Sharfeddin, a sheep rancher herself, fleshes out the feel and smell of a sheep ranch.  The book's title comes from a special breed of sheep, which the reader learns a fair amount about in the course of the novel, and the rhythm of the work (it's lambing time) creates a structured flow. An impressive first novel from a writer to watch.icts not easily settled and no simple resolution.

When i read it, i knew it was going to be one of my favourite books for life.<br /><br />Emily Bronte's tale of incest, death, insantiy and fate never seems to grow old whilst leaving a testement to the past at the same time. Without a doubt, Wuthering Heights also contains one of the most powerful and potent settings of any book. The book's narrative is divided into two stories- the first of Cathy and Heathcliff and the second of Catherine and Hareton. Which did i prefer? Heathcliff as the hero, but i couldn't not love him as the villain too.Perhaps the main reason i adore this book so much is the obscure complexity of Heathcliff and Cathy and the undying list of themes that seem to grow in number everytime one picks up the book. Any author who succeeds in forcing the reader to like the bad and hate the good has done an amiable task and Emily Bronte does that to the fullest degree. Let's not forget the brilliant insults either. A fabulous read for anyone old enough to appreciate greatness.	2005-10-10

That, in itself, wouldn't be a problem if the story, characters and dialogue were engaging.  I happen to find The Sword of Shannara a fun read, even though it lifted nearly every character archetype and concept from Lord of the Rings (a charge which Brooks denies, btw).  But Terry Brooks was able to make the world of Shannara unique or at least somewhat his own (Brooks also wrote some other good Shannara books, such as Elfstones of Shannara).  I'm not saying Brooks is a tremendous author, but his works have at least something to offer.<br /><br />But Eragon's characters and story aren't engaging, his world suggests nothing uniqe and the book is not particularly well written.  With so many disparate elements pulled from other works, he has created a sort of \\"Frankenstein's Monster\\" of fantasy novels.  The book is rather hodgepodge; there is no backbone, no weight, no glue.  At least it has none of its own but tries to assume that of other books, almost through osmosis.  Ideas are taken from other works (the names of which have already been mentioned ad nauseum) and just sort of inserted. It has a sort of \\"write-by-numbers\\" feel to it.<br /><br />The story lacks a strong sense or weight of history, though the author tries to effect such throughout the book.  Things just sort of happen because they're supposed to according to the usual fantasy story template not because the author had any particular vision.  The result is, unfortunately, artificial.<br /><br />For example, the boy Eragon becomes a so-called (and quite accomplished) Rider before the reader even gets a sense of or appreciate what a Rider is (assuming they're unfamiliar with McCaffrey's Pern series, that is).  Also, concepts and past events are exposited to no end and too quickly as the story moves along, giving the work a rushed feel.  Even the initial \\"quest\\" is rather weak, involving nothing more than a desire for revenge by Eragon (and an uninteresting episode or two that involves looking up shipping records).  This is the hook by which Eragon ultimately becomes the \\"chosen one\\" (or a chosen one) and it's pretty non-compelling stuff.  The stilted dialogue and lack of humor in the book doesn't help.<br /><br />All this is understandable for a young author.  I'm sure ever aspiring author has done something of the same for his/her first stab at writing fantasy.  The problem with Paolini's book is that someone went and published it.<br /><br />Another point I'd like make (and which has raised by others) is I'm wondering why this is being sold as a children's book.  Even in adult fantasy, call me crazy, but I'm not sure the sight of an impaled baby is something readers necessarily want to conjure in their minds.  Such a sight would almost be a shock even in George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series.  Presumably, it's to make the as-yet unseen villain to be as evil as possible, but it's forced, excessive and reeks of shock value.  If you have to resort to such blatant tactics to make your villains despicable, you're on the wrong track, imo.  There are other graphic descriptions of violence in the book that seem out of place in what is allegedly a children's book.  Again, this is understandable in the sense that the writer hasn't even come close to perfecting his craft.  But someone told him his book was good (his parents, in fact) and they went and published it, so there's little chance that Paolini will improve his skills as a writer (especially as he is alleged to ignore criticism - good and bad), if his books keep making the bestseller list.<br /><br />I did see potential in the book and there were some passages I actually found somewhat interesting.  Unfortunately, the overall concept is just too derivative and the potential is never truly realised.  The idea needed further development, ingenuity and lots of rewrites.<br /><br />A few final thoughts:<br /><br />I'm curious as tothe frequent comparison in these reviews between the name Eragon and Aragorn of Lord of the Rings.  The resemblance is superficial, nothing more, and there is little resemblance between the two characters.  If anything, there would seem to be a greater resemblance between Eragon and Dave Edding's Garion (perhaps another name to add to the list of ideas that Paolini borrowed); the archetypes appear to be similar there (I say 'appear' because I've not read anything of Eddings), as do the names (if you substitute the 'e' in Eragon, with an 'i,' you can spell 'Garion').<br /><br />As far as his borrowing other ideas, he's not the only one.  Besides the previously mentioned authors, Star Wars itself is hardly an entirely unique story, having borrowed from such works as LotR and the movies of Akira Kurosawa.  It's not the fact that Paolini pilfering these concepts from others, it's that he's not doing anything interesting with them.  Again, the amateurish feel of the work is entirely understandable.  What's puzzling is that it's been published and that so many people have failed to see it for what it is.Eragon and Aragorn of Lord of the Rings.

He has also created a main character who is pretty despicable yet always seeking the reader's approval--kind of pathetic.  Anyway, everyone just love love loves this book, so I decided to read it and was VERY disappointed.  Hosseini is not a good writer; he perpetually tries too hard.  The more gruesome plot points are calculated to make the reader feel oh-so-outraged and superior, but paradoxically are also rather prurient.  The villain is a caricature and there is no plausible explanation for his sadism.  I want high quality writing out of a book.  In my opinion, this book failed on that score.  There is some interesting information about Afghanistan and Kabul, but that was an incidental positive in the mostly negative experience of reading the book.	2005-10-10

Is entertaining and just the right mix of legal matters, mystery, and personal feelings and happenings for young judge Deborah, who, I marvel, is the 12th child of Kezzie Knott, born after his 11 sons.  Kezzie, one of the more memorable characters (a backwoods moonshiner with a high intellect and a legendary family) makes a brief appearance at the end of the story, as Deborah finally ties the knot with deputy Dwight Bryant.<br /><br />Maron skillfully mixes the wedding (with all the trimmings) while digging in to interlocking crimes. One is the sad murder of a local Assistant DA, one a long-ago murder by a woman who is now on death row.  Both Dwight and Deborah get caught in the underpinnings, and effectively work together...going up a blind alley until the truth presents itself.<br /><br />Maron's stories of North Carolina, where she's a native, draw you in and make you feel as though you are there.  Her heroine is charming and wise, and the stories just keep getting better.  It will be interesting to see where Maron takes the series now that Deborah has a new role in life.<br /><br />A great read!	2005-10-10

Its strength is it covers the basic knowledge essential to working in the Neuro ICU.  The chapter on Head Trauma is excellent and integrates knowledge on the polytrauma victim as well as the patient in multiorgan failure.  Unlike some other books, it does not describe Intensive Neurosurgery isolated in a vacuum.  It reads 1000pgs so it is a good first book to consult on the subject.  The specialist and researcher will need additional monographs and books such as Head Injury by Bullock and Reilly, Bullock's Monitoring in Neurotrauma, Neurochemical Monitoring ca: 1998, Advances in Brain Resuscitation by Siesjo which is an older book ca: 1993, and have a reference like Youman's and Batjer ready to look up some specifics on the Neurosurgical side of things.  Brian Andrews has written 3 books on neurosurgical intensive care including one on Peds Neuro ICU.  His are more concise and about 400 pgs.  You just have to pick up certain pearls of wisdom from each.  Layton's book is the place to start in my opinion and you cannot go wrong there.  Not much is mentioned on research with jugular venous oximetry and CO2 monitoring and microdialysis techniques.  Pressure waves are better described by Andrews books.  He takes a distinctly neurosurgical perspective on topics.	2005-10-10

If you read with an open mind, you'll hear about a life not so different from any woman's. Who among us didn't make mistakes when we were young and eager to find a place for ourselves in the world? Now imagine if your every misstep made national news.<br /><br />Many of us can identify with growing up with an emotionally stunted father and the damage that does to a young girl's psyche (not to mention having a mother who commits suicide and a variety of stepmothers, some wonderful, some not so), how she becomes too eager to find approval in the arms of a variety of men whose demands reshape her personality, even her appearance. As she herself admits, she becomes the reflection of each of her husbands, the sex kitten for Vadim, the political activist for Hayden, the glued at the hip companion for the neurotic Ted Turner. Where is the real Jane? Even she wants to know.<br /><br />And all the husbands cheat on her, and she is as devastated and hurt as we commonfolk. I was surprised, imagining movie stars had so many options, they could quickly move on. It is a puzzling life, to be able to be naked on a movie stage and fake intimacy with another actor, and then be able to feel betrayal and pain when you find out your husband is cheating on you. When you step in and out of fantasy and reality like that all your life, how can you blame her for letting her political activism and visit to Hanoi get out of hand? It was another role, and she is well aware what it cost her, although she proves in one chapter that one-on-one, she is willing to face the Vietnam veterans who so hate her and by the time it's all said, everyone is hugging and crying together.<br /><br />I sped-read through much of her political activism and charity work, not finding that too engrossing, but the whole Ted Turner relationship was amazing and answered so many of my questions. He is an amazing man (who was terribly, terribly abused as a child and marked by it) who gives a woman so much, but in exchange demands more than any woman can give back and remain sane. And he's incapable of fidelity. He goes on TV now and says it ended because she became a Christian, but he's kidding himself. It ended because she wanted space to spend with her children and grandchildren and he can't give whoever is his constant companion any space.<br /><br />And living with Hayden in a little house full of other people, how awful is that? Man, she put up with a lot.<br /><br />It is most definitely a book for women, so I am looking cross-eyed at any of the rabid negative reviews posted by men here.

This chief good is eudaimonia, which is often translated as 'happiness' (but can also be translated as 'thriving' or 'flourishing'). Aristotle sees pleasure, honour and virtue as significant 'wants' for people, and then argues that virtue is the most important of these.<br /><br />In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle makes the claim that happiness is something which is both precious and final. This seems to be so because it is a first principle or ultimate starting point. For, it is for the sake of happiness that we do everything else, and we regard the cause of all good things to be precious and divine. Moreover, since happiness is an activity of the soul in accordance with complete and perfect virtue, it is necessary to consider virtue, as this will be the best way of studying happiness.<br /><br />How many of us today speak of happiness and virtue in the same breath? Aristotle's work in the Nicomachean Ethics is considered one of his greatest achievements, and by extension, one of the greatest pieces of philosophy from the ancient world. When the framers of the American Declaration of Independence were thinking of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, there is little doubt they had an acquaintance with Aristotle's work connecting happiness, virtue, and ethics together.<br /><br />When one thinks of ethical ideas such as an avoidance of extremes, of taking the tolerant or middle ground, or of taking all things in moderation, one is tapping into Aristotle's ideas. It is in the Nicomachean Ethics that Aristotle proposes the Doctrine of the Mean - he states that virtue is a 'mean state', that is, it aims for the mean or middle ground. However, Aristotle is often misquoted and misinterpreted here, for he very quickly in the text disallows the idea of the mean to be applied in all cases. There are things, actions and emotions, that do not allow the mean state. Thus, Aristotle tends to view virtue as a relative state, making the analogy with food - for some, two pounds of meat might be too much food, but for others, it might be too little. The mean exists between the state of deficiency, too little, and excessiveness, too much.<br /><br />Aristotle proposes many different examples of virtues and vices, together with their mean states. With regard to money, being stingy and being illiberal with generosity are the extremes, the one deficient and the other excessive. The mean state here would be liberality and generosity, a willingness to buy and to give, but not to extremes. Anger, too, is highlighted as having a deficient state (too much passivity), an excessive state (too much passion) and a mean state (a gentleness but firmness with regard to emotions).<br /><br />Aristotle states that one of the difficulties with leading a virtuous life is that it takes a person of science to find the mean between the extremes (or, in some cases, Aristotle uses the image of a circle, the scientist finding the centre). Many of us, being imperfect humans, err on one side or the other, choosing in Aristotle's words, the lesser of two evils. Aristotle's wording here, that a scientist is the only one fully capable of virtue, has a different meaning for scientist - this is a pre-modern, pre-Enlightenment view; for Aristotle, the person of science is one who is capable of observation and calculation, and this can take many different forms.<br /><br />Aristotle uses different kinds of argumentation in the Nicomachean Ethics. He uses a dialectical method, as well as a functional method. In the dialectical method, there are opposing ideas held in tension, whose interactions against each other yield a result - this is often how the mean between extremes is derived. However, there are other times that Aristotle seems to prefer a more direct, functional approach. Both of these methods lead to the same understanding for Aristotle's sense of the rational - that humanity's highestor final good is happiness.<br /><br />There is a discussion of the human soul (for this is where virtue and happiness reside). Aristotle argues that virtue is not a natural state; we are not born with nor do we acquire through any natural processes virtue, but rather through 'habitation', an embedding process or enculturation that makes these a part of our soul. However, it is not sufficient for Aristotle's virtue that one merely function as a virtuous person or that virtuous things be done. This is not a skill, but rather an art, and to be virtuous, one must live virtuously and act virtuously with intention as well as form.<br /><br />Of course, one of the implications here is that virtue is a quantifiable thing, that periodically resurfaces in later philosophies. How do we calculate virtue?<br /><br />This is a difficult question, and not one that Aristotle answers in any definitive way. However, more important than this is the key difference that Aristotle displayed setting himself apart from his tutor Plato; rather than seeing the possession of 'the good' or 'virtue' as the highest ideal, Aristotle is concerned with the practical aspects, the ethics of this. Based on Aristotle's lectures in Athens in the fourth century BCE, this remains one of the most important works on ethical and moral philosophy in history.umanity's highest or final good is happiness.  <br /> <br />There is a discussion of the human soul (for this is where virtue and happiness reside).

Actually, I listened to this as an unabridged audiotape read by the author.  A long drive was made quite enjoyable, although hearing about all these fabulous cakes was making me hungry!  The book fell into trite tidiness at the end, and went from having Jane Austenish wisdom to more of a women's magazine kind of literature as the author made everything turn out all right for everyone.  Too fairy tale for my taste. <br /> <br />The plot involves a middle-aged woman in Minneapolis who has an annoying teen-age daughter, her mother living with her, and a husband whom she loves but who early on in the book announces he has been laid off as the result of a corporate takeover.  Then she receives a phone call informing her that her father -- long and bitterly estranged from her mother -- will need someone to take care of him for a while.  There's no alternative really, as she sees it, but to take him into her home.  Her mother is not happy. <br /> <br />The woman (Ruth) escapes when she's feeling stressed by imagining herself inside a large and wonderful cake.  Did I mention she loves cakes and is a fabulous -- truly fabulous -- baker of cakes? <br /> <br />So the book describes her daily life, caring for sometimes difficult family members, trying to keep the peace, and baking fabulous cakes, described at some length.  She made me what to try doing some baking myself.  She got the emotions right, and she's a good storyteller, but by the ending, I thought she took the easy and trite way out. <br /> <br />The author read her own book, which has advantages and disadvantages, but it did make it seem as if she were telling her own life story and not someone else's. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

This review assumes you're actually someone willing to play Street Fighter more often than once a month casually at a friend's house. If that's the case with you, you shouldn't bother buying this book - it isn't for you. This book is for dedicated SF players. Now, that I've made this one thing clear, I can move on. <br /> <br />Probably everyone who plays SF knows that this is not a typical fighting genre game. Mashing will get you nowhere here and the game certainly isn't \\"user friendly\\". The guide follows this notion - it's very clearly written, explicitly describes all the techniques, but isn't a \\"for dummies\\" material because, let's face it, SF is not a game \\"for dummies\\".  <br /> <br />That said, the strategy guide has it all. The basic techniques, their implementations, specials, combos, tactics, together with advanced tactics involving the more technically difficult aspects of SF3:TS such as kara techniques and red parrying. This isn't a guide to beat the comp, this a guide dedicated to people who want to play another person. It excells in that, both in the SF2 and SF3:TS section. The strategies are ones tested in real-life, not ones the authors thought up against a computer player.  <br /> <br />If you want to learn to play SF2 or 3:TS for real, this is the book you'll want.	2005-10-10

Brian Robeson's parents divorce so he has to take plane rides to visit his dad, who built a self cleaning self sharpening drill. In his trip the pilot teaches Brian how to keep the plane steady. During his flight he realized that the pilot was having a heart attack.  Brian took the wheel and kept it steady until he ran out of fuel and landed in an L-shaped lake. Brian had to live of the land until someone found him. Eventually he was able to get into the plane and find a distress beacon and get back to civilization. <br /> <br />This was a very thrilling book. You really get attached to Brian and fear for his life.  I suggest this book to anyone who has free time or has to read a book for school. <br />  <br />Brian displayed great courage many times in this book like when he grabbed the wheel of the plane and kept it steady a lot of people would have lost their cool in that situation.  Also it took a lot of courage to venture back into the plane even though he knew that there was a dead body waiting for him.  These are just a few of the times that he displayed great courage.  <br /> <br />In this book you could really see the main character developing.  Like when he ate those bad berries and got sick but then later he was able to figure out how to eat what the animals were eating.  I really enjoyed seeing the main character mature through this story. <br /> <br />The conflict in this book was very interesting because you couldn't really tell who the antagonist was.  It could have been nature because he had to survive in nature.  Also it could have been his divorced parents because they were the actual cause of the problem because he was on a plain going to visit his dad. <br /> <br />This was an all around great book I really didn't want to put it down.  The main character Brian was very interesting because he wasn't just a stock character.  I would definitely recommend this bookto any one who is looking for a good riveting book. <br />	2005-10-10

He is a sad example that crime sometimes pay. <br /> <br />Man with long criminal record and someone who is the most responsible for international growth of criminal organization named Hells Angels MC is now celebrated as an American hero. <br /> <br />His autobiography is well written but he \\"neglected\\" to mention few things. <br /> <br />For example, that Hells Angels are involved in drug trafficking and are the biggest producers of metaphetamine in the USA. <br /> <br />Second, about violent wars with other motorcycle gangs like the Outlaws, the Mongols or the Bandidos(in Scandinavia). <br /> <br />Third about murders within Hells Angels like about the whole chapter in Canada being destroyed by fellow Angels in the 80s(so called North Chapter). Some members were murdered, few out of fear became police informants(like Apache Trudeau who committed 43 murders for the Angels). <br /> <br />Many other thing like this weren't mentioned either. <br />	2005-10-10

I got this book pretty much because I enjoyed his last two books (I still think that his second is his best to date). As I read, I found some good material that'll definitely be helpful to anybody looking for the inspiration to become a dating success story. I like how he uses his never-settle-for-less attitude to really get readers to understand how critical it is to be confident in yourself and not only applying that winning attitude to dating, but to your whole life in general. This book is for guys who are sick and tired of letting their lack of self-esteem hinder themselves from a florishing love life; the guys who have been subjected to being put in the dreaded \\"friends zone\\" by the objects of their affection one too many times; or the guys who simply need to upgrade on the type of women they're dealing with.    Although most of his material, I feel, has a lot of validity to it, there were several things that I found be either contradictory, insensitive or just plain bull [...] One thing that remained constant with all three of his offerings is ability generalize women (or people rather) in such a way that, though I sure he means well, can be outright demeaning. My gripe isn't the fact that he generalizes, it's the way he does it. However, we all know the generalizations wouldn't be if there weren't any truth to them, so I digress. Also, I can't help but to notice how he constantly he implies that women that may be considered overweight (in general or by media standards) aren't worthy love interests. Personally, I don't think you could write a book in which you're encouraging guys to \\"step their game up\\" with the caliber of women they're getting, at the same time, implying that overweight women aren't good enough. Then, after the fact, write a book to empower women with the same intentions, although some of these female readers may be overweight themselves, who may have enough trouble trying to accept their image. I don't know if it's just me, but there is a clash of interest there.    Despite some descrepancies, this book as a world of good points and useful advice that can propell any man's game, but only if he's willing to assert himself to the greatness that this book promises readers, that is.	2005-10-10

I was captivated with the imagined scene of gathering around a fire with a group of entranced people listening to the calming lilt of the voice of the storyteller and the comfortingly familiar (to them) stories of Tasurinchi.  I could really imagine what it would be like to feel that this was important in their lives.  The storyteller was like a medicine man or a shaman whose words were like a healing balm for a people who felt misplaced in the world as it was becoming for them.  Mascarita had the soul of a storyteller because he perhaps carried an unconscious identification with his ancestors who wandered as nomads in the desert; a people with no permanent home.  For this and many other reasons, he understood what it meant to have no solid ground on which to stand.   <br /> <br />Is it better for an anthropologist, as one who studies other cultures, to keep an academic distance from the people who are his subjects?  How far should participant observation be taken?  Saul Zuratas took it all the way.  He abandoned the modern world and joined with a culture that was trying to avoid being assimilated into the world of zombies.  The Machinguenga is a culture that is deeply imbued with meaning in every area.  Globalization says that progress is king.  If a `traditional' culture is impacted by global culture, that is just part of life.  Do we hold `traditional' cultures back by wanting them to stay frozen in the past?  Or are we `helping' them by bringing them up-to-date with our modern world?  I sometimes think it is a battle of meaning versus modernization.  Can the two be compatible?	2005-10-10

Books	4	5	6	N	N	Good for a Financial Novice, not as a How-To	I enjoyed this book mainly because growning up my dad was exactly like the poor dad in this book (PhD, obsessed with a secure job) and gave me the same \\"bad\\" advice that Kiyosaki's poor dad gave him.  So, if you're a novice when it comes to finance like I am, this book will likely turn some ideas you have about money on their head.  The main one is that becoming educated and finding a secure job is simply not enough if you want to become wealthy.  I'm sure this is obvious to many people, but it was news to me.   <br /> <br />The book is extremely non-specific, so you will only really be able to get concepts, not real world know-how. It becomes clear fairly early on that this is not a how-to book.  Kiyosaki gives barely any specific examples of how he made his millions, and the ones he does give are anecdotes, meant to illustrate a concept more than show a finacial tactic.  As I read through it, I found myself often thinking \\"I'm going to have to look into this...\\", as the author only points you toward ideas you may not have heard, leaving it to you to investigate.   <br /> <br />I like the author after reading the book, but it should also be noted that he is a terrible writer.  He actually admits this about midway through the book in one of his acedotes.  The book is written at around the 5th grade level, so it won't take you more than a couple of hours to finish.   <br /> <br />If you're curious about money making, this book is a good place to start.	2005-10-10

But the deal has an outrageous condition - marriage to the notorious Estrella Medrano! Ram&oacute;n won't be forced into anything, least of all a wedding with a scarlet woman!<br /><br />But Estrella is not what he thought. Ram&oacute;n can't get her gorgeous body out of his mind. He even starts to believe she may not deserve her reputation! A marriage of convenience - and desire - might be a good deal after all....<br /><br />My review - Estrella is in the unenviable position of having one man after another bribed by her father to marry her - she has the task of convincing them she doesn't want to wed them - each time her father puts more pressure on her.  Ramon is the tenth man he tries to bribe.  Passion flares between them, but Ramon treats Estrella with contempt because he, like everyone else, has heard the story of how she stole an older man away from his wife and children & ran off with him.  The man died a week later in a car accident, but Estrella has not been able to escape the scandal or her fathers censure.  No one has ever asked to hear her side of the story, and it appears that Ramon is no different.<br /><br />Estrella visits Ramon and passion flares out of control - she offers to marry him so he can get the tv station and she can get her father off her back - she tells him that they can divorce later.  They end up on bed making love all night.  In the morning, Ramon surprises her by telling her that he still isn't interested in wedding a woman like her.  She leaves his house heartbroken - feeling cheap.<br /><br />Ramon cannot get her out of his mind, he thinks about her and their night together constantly until he can't take it anymore and decides to visit her.  He ends up dropping in a dinner party with her, her father, and bachelor number eleven - an old, fat, short man with a good reputation who Estrella's father has told her she will have to marry or be cast out into the street.  Ramon takes the scene in and understands whats going on - he sees the shadows under Estrella's eyes and how miserable she is and he impulsively announces to her father that they are going to marry & that he asked her to keep it a secret until they could tell him together.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD - They marry, they make mad passionate love & both come to feel a lot more than lust for each other, but suspect that their love is in vain.  Estrella shows Ramon a marriage certificate from years ago - the man who turned her into a scarlet woman pretended he was single and committed bigamy to fake marry her and get her into bed.  He is devastated to learn that he misjudged her so badly - it is a great read.  My favorite part is when Estrella comes down the aisle in a red wedding gown - she has guts!takes the scene in and understands whats going on - he sees the shadows under Estrella's eyes and how miserable she is and he impulsively announces to her father that they are going to marry & that he asked her to keep it a secret until they could tell him together. <br /> <br />SPOILER AHEAD - They marry, they make mad passionate love & both come to feel a lot more than lust for each other, but suspect that their love is in vain.

After reading through Brother (yes i said Brother) Woodrow's booklets of \\"Easter Is It Pagan\\" and \\"Christmas Reconsidered\\" i've reached the following conclusion.  Brother Woodrow is using the famous \\"straw-man argument methodology\\" that writers, salesmen, speakers, and even magicians utilize.  When i entitled this \\"slight of hand\\" i didn't mean that Mr. Woodrow was being purposefully deceptive, i meant he moves the reader from their grounded truth and the reader can end up worrying about the detailed scarecrow.  You bring up something interesting, focus on it INSTEAD OF the plain truths, and eventually folks forget the plain truths they held dear.  A straw-man (scarecrow) was put in the fields and gardens so those who came looking for food, became distracted by the straw-man and either left the area or concentrated on the straw-man.  Hopefully, leaving garden and fields alone was the achievement.  In addition to straw-man usage ALL throughout the booklets, Mr. Woodrow leaves out many things defined by dictionaries and encyclopedias CONVENIENTLY, and only posts the parts which support his opinion that Easter and Christmas are simply godly holidays.  He often goes back-and-forth, sometimes saying \\"no pagan connection, no harm\\" and then \\"let's assume it COULD be pagan, what harm now??\\"    The God of Israel (and Jesus therefore) has made it clear, it's a \\"no-no\\" to mix OR REPLACE His Holidays (religious) with other's invented/created/inherited/derived holidays.  Brother Woodrow is distracting from, or side-stepping, these issues.  Brother Woodrow takes you through straw-men single-sided arguments such as word histories and even emotional stories of the celebrations of Christmas and Easter.  Our God doesn't ignore mixing religious holidays (or any syncretism!!) of other nations/peoples with His Holidays, and He MOST DEFINITELY DOESN'T like you to use a secular-based holiday instead/over-top of His Appointed Times/Holidays (Holy Days).  There is no way around this.  God expects you to do the BEST YOU CAN with what you know (keep learning of HOW to pursue & please & obey Him & HIS CHOICES OF HOW we are to worship & love Him) in following His Instructions.    I wrote these (items below) down in both booklets, in case anybody ever picks them up and reads them, to help people QUIT LOOKING AT THE STRAW-MAN and instead keep reading/searching from a firm foundation of Biblical Truth and Patterns.  Hopefully these help others if i post them here, to think thru things.    1. if a practice (pagan/non-pagan words or traditions) arises that replaces the LORD'S Appointed Times, Practices,Observances & Words (instead of, in lieu of, similar but separate from...), GOD forbids it!  2.  if a term today comes from words that are NOT pagan in nature or ritual or origin, WHO CARES!  3.  if a term today comes from words that ARE PAGAN in nature, & you are NOT practicing or doing them (any of their associated rituals), WHO CARES!  4.  if a term today comes from words that ARE PAGAN and rituals or honor is somehow showed to it (extended from it, & whether in ignorance or intentional) and practiced, GOD CARES!!  5.  Questionable origins can be debated (perhaps), but replacement holidays CANNOT.  Association can be debated, & ignorance too, but NOT merging or replacing!  6.  We are NOT to follow the FALLEN WAYS of the nations (around us).  7.  We are not to knowingly speak the names of the \\"false gods\\" out of our mouths knowingly, or present before the God of Israel, in ANY honoring/worshipful/celebratory way.  8.  Linguistics & superstition are NOT the focus, it's practice that has religious ties (PRACTICING IT/HONORING IT SOMEHOW) that's the focus and theissue at hand.  9.  We are to be Holy people, and Holy simply means \\"set-apart,\\" in word and in deed, the BEST WE CAN.  We aren't to take in the habits of others with regards to religious holidays, and look similar to them while saying \\"praise God!\\"    Hope this helps you or others.  Please do not waste your monies on these two booklets by Brother Woodrow about Easter and Christmas being \\"harmless\\" and \\"okay\\" and \\"Holy and acceptable to God.\\"  At the SAME TIME, please be gentle with the Brethren who don't have any CLUE about the origins and replacement days they are observing, you will only cause needless division if you bark at them.  Lead by example, in ALL obedience to the God of Israel, don't hit others over the head with the Bible.  The Holy Spirit is well equipped to do any convicting <smile>.     Finally, if you don't understand that Believers in Jesus the Nazarene (Yeshua HaNatzeret)were taught by the Master that they need to Have His testimony of being our Salvation (spiritually now, physically to come!) AS WELL AS THEY NEED TO obey His commandments (we need to obey the Torah/Instructions of the God of Israel), then you will struggle with the whole idea of following God's instructions in these areas. Some searching on the Internet for what it means to have the testimony of Jesus (Yeshua)and keeping the commandments of God, will  help you out.  Just use maturity, and avoid immaturity when doing so.    Grace and Peace to you in our Beloved Messiah,  Fredrick Murphy	2005-10-10

It was merely a basic understanding, a good one but no more, and left me looking for some real substance throughout the book.  There are some helpful tidbits, the scholarship is fine, but is very basic, undergrad, laymen material.  So if your looking for a good introduction to the subject of amillenialism, this book is fine.

Grene states in her introduction to the 1959 edition that she probably needs a chapter on Tillich as well; her conclusion in the text about the incompatibilities of existentialism and Christianity need to be modified in light of his work.<br /><br />'Existentialism is the philosophy which declares as its first principle that existence is prior to essence.' Kierkegaard and Heidegger both construct a metaphysics along these lines; for many of the existentialist, it leads to a bleak knowledge of the world devoid of values, that some find differents ways to escape - Kierkegaard and Marcel go back to concepts of God, whereas others like Sartre carry the despair itself as a primary motif.<br /><br />Grene looks at the political, social, metaphysical, epistemological and ethical implications of existentialism, as well as the main areas of overlap between the major thinkers. This is an introductory text, so Grene does not explore the areas of difficulty as much as could be done, but for an introduction, such considerations can be left for later research. This book does assume some familiarity with philosophy generally - Grene uses terminology without providing a glossary that the reader unfamiliar with philosophy might find difficult.<br /><br />As the twenty-first century dawns, existentialism has fallen somewhat out of favour, but it has yet to be replaced by any particular school of thought. Philosophy in the present and future will have to take into account the ideas and developments of the existentialists regardless of whether or not they agree. This is a good text for those beginning to explore existentialism, even after fifty years since it was written.sent and future will have to take into account the ideas and developments of the existentialists regardless of whether or not they agree.

An American (Cal) in England finds himself working with Walter Stilton (a working class  Chief Inspector) who  in their joint search for an   American spy in Lodon, share many interesting and humorous cultural exchanges.  Cal's introduction to  English tea is one example. I frequently found myself laughing out loud.  There is also a fast paced and humorous sexual thread. Sgt Troy of Scotland Yard, a central figure in earlier novels, makes a lower  key appearance. The story is fast, the action believable, the comments on life during the blitz accurate and altogether this is the most enjoyable, moving and tense novel I have read for many a long time.	2005-10-10

Like Wellhausen did a century ago, Friedman has essentially updated, expanded, and clarified the Documentary Hypothesis so as to make a book on this subject from just 30 years ago seem hopelessly outdated.  P in the postexilic period?  Psssshaw...    While I had heard of this book before, I was naturally skeptical of its rather large claims, but after seeing the evidence for myself I agree with Friedman's conclusion- J and the Court History, as well as several texts in between, were written by the same author as part of a single narrative (perhaps initially \\"published\\" in two volumes), that covered the Hebrews' traditional history from creation to the accession of Solomon.    My only problem is with Friedman's translation of the work- I understand that it was his intention to translate the work as literally as possible, in order for the readers to get a feel of what it may have read like in Hebrew; nonetheless, this really made for awkward reading; I had to put the book down a couple times because the tedious vocabulary was giving me a headache.  That may be what it's supposed to sound like in Hebrew, but in English it doesn't necessarily work.    However, the story and commentary are very well-written, the evidence is convincingly-presented, and, underneath the awkward translation, a genius of an author is remembered for the first time in over 2800 years.  Worth it in my book.	2005-10-10

This chief good is eudaimonia, which is often translated as 'happiness' (but can also be translated as 'thriving' or 'flourishing'). Aristotle sees pleasure, honour and virtue as significant 'wants' for people, and then argues that virtue is the most important of these.<br /><br />In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle makes the claim that happiness is something which is both precious and final. This seems to be so because it is a first principle or ultimate starting point. For, it is for the sake of happiness that we do everything else, and we regard the cause of all good things to be precious and divine. Moreover, since happiness is an activity of the soul in accordance with complete and perfect virtue, it is necessary to consider virtue, as this will be the best way of studying happiness.<br /><br />How many of us today speak of happiness and virtue in the same breath? Aristotle's work in the Nicomachean Ethics is considered one of his greatest achievements, and by extension, one of the greatest pieces of philosophy from the ancient world. When the framers of the American Declaration of Independence were thinking of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, there is little doubt they had an acquaintance with Aristotle's work connecting happiness, virtue, and ethics together.<br /><br />When one thinks of ethical ideas such as an avoidance of extremes, of taking the tolerant or middle ground, or of taking all things in moderation, one is tapping into Aristotle's ideas. It is in the Nicomachean Ethics that Aristotle proposes the Doctrine of the Mean - he states that virtue is a 'mean state', that is, it aims for the mean or middle ground. However, Aristotle is often misquoted and misinterpreted here, for he very quickly in the text disallows the idea of the mean to be applied in all cases. There are things, actions and emotions, that do not allow the mean state. Thus, Aristotle tends to view virtue as a relative state, making the analogy with food - for some, two pounds of meat might be too much food, but for others, it might be too little. The mean exists between the state of deficiency, too little, and excessiveness, too much.<br /><br />Aristotle proposes many different examples of virtues and vices, together with their mean states. With regard to money, being stingy and being illiberal with generosity are the extremes, the one deficient and the other excessive. The mean state here would be liberality and generosity, a willingness to buy and to give, but not to extremes. Anger, too, is highlighted as having a deficient state (too much passivity), an excessive state (too much passion) and a mean state (a gentleness but firmness with regard to emotions).<br /><br />Aristotle states that one of the difficulties with leading a virtuous life is that it takes a person of science to find the mean between the extremes (or, in some cases, Aristotle uses the image of a circle, the scientist finding the centre). Many of us, being imperfect humans, err on one side or the other, choosing in Aristotle's words, the lesser of two evils. Aristotle's wording here, that a scientist is the only one fully capable of virtue, has a different meaning for scientist - this is a pre-modern, pre-Enlightenment view; for Aristotle, the person of science is one who is capable of observation and calculation, and this can take many different forms.<br /><br />Aristotle uses different kinds of argumentation in the Nicomachean Ethics. He uses a dialectical method, as well as a functional method. In the dialectical method, there are opposing ideas held in tension, whose interactions against each other yield a result - this is often how the mean between extremes is derived. However, there are other times that Aristotle seems to prefer a more direct, functional approach. Both of these methods lead to the same understanding for Aristotle's sense of the rational - that humanity's highestor final good is happiness.<br /><br />There is a discussion of the human soul (for this is where virtue and happiness reside). Aristotle argues that virtue is not a natural state; we are not born with nor do we acquire through any natural processes virtue, but rather through 'habitation', an embedding process or enculturation that makes these a part of our soul. However, it is not sufficient for Aristotle's virtue that one merely function as a virtuous person or that virtuous things be done. This is not a skill, but rather an art, and to be virtuous, one must live virtuously and act virtuously with intention as well as form.<br /><br />Of course, one of the implications here is that virtue is a quantifiable thing, that periodically resurfaces in later philosophies. How do we calculate virtue?<br /><br />This is a difficult question, and not one that Aristotle answers in any definitive way. However, more important than this is the key difference that Aristotle displayed setting himself apart from his tutor Plato; rather than seeing the possession of 'the good' or 'virtue' as the highest ideal, Aristotle is concerned with the practical aspects, the ethics of this. Based on Aristotle's lectures in Athens in the fourth century BCE, this remains one of the most important works on ethical and moral philosophy in history.umanity's highest or final good is happiness.  <br /> <br />There is a discussion of the human soul (for this is where virtue and happiness reside).

It features the same creators and cast from the recent Tertiary and Quandary Phases (which means that most of the original cast from the 1978 to 1980 radio shows appear.) <br /> <br />While the book itself was a major disappointment, the radio adaption manages to be funny, interesting, thought-provoking and very satisfying.  The writers have focused the story, created new scenes, included characters which Adams had apparently forgotten about over the course of the \\"trilogy,\\" brilliantly converted the novel's rambling prose into dialogue and guide entries, stayed true to Adams' original intentions while simultaneously improving them considerably, and have created a new epilogue for the story which takes us beyond what Adams ever wrote and ties up the entire saga in a way so clever and sweet as to make a grown man cry.  Such a brilliant adaption stands in stark contrast with the abysmal, dumbed-down script which was used for the recent film.  THIS is the way to adapt a Hitchhiker's book. <br /> <br />Since the book concerns a parallel Earth and features two versions of the character Trillian (each from a different continuity in improbability,) it's of particular fan interest that the two Trillians are played by Susan Sheridan, the original radio actress, and Sandra Dickinson, who created the role for BBC television.  As in the Tertiary Phase, Douglas Adams himself appears as Agrajag.  I won't spoil the surprise of who else shows up. <br /> <br />As with all the previous radio entries, it's odd, brilliant, confusing and dense enough to warrant an immediate second listening, and has enough depth to offer new discoveries several listenings later.  I couldn't be happier with how it all came out.  Which leads me to wonder... <br /> <br />Why does this have to be the last one?  If the producers don't wish to invent their own H2G2 episodes, I hope they turn their attentions to Dirk Gently, Douglas Adams' other comedic book series.  A creative unit as successful as this shouldn't stop now.	2005-10-10

Claiming that \\"If we ever learned anything, then we learned it by the Trivium method--whether we knew it or not,\\" the Bluedorns lay down detailed theories and plans for deliberately teaching by the Trivium, the ancient method by which mankind learns how to learn.<br /><br />Harvey and Laurie Bluedorn began their own journey through classical education when they first started homeschooling in 1980. Their emphasis on classical learning styles and subjects has given them a unique voice in today's homeschooling culture. \\"Teaching the Trivium\\" is the result of their many years of exploring and experimenting; learning and teaching. Originally published as a series of eight booklets, the information in \\"Teaching the Trivium\\" has been expanded and combined to produce an overview of classical education for homeschoolers.<br /><br />Though it is emphasised that Trivium is not a list of subjects but a way of learning, the book does give a great deal of time to classical subjects such as formal logic, ancient languages, and literature. Various educational practices are resurrected from the past and reintroduced to homeschooling families: copywork and narration, oratory and debate. The book features plenty of practical helps and curriculum recommendations, making every subject accessible. Trivium is also applied to the stages of child development, giving suggestions on when to teach what for the best possible results. Because of the great volume of information in this book, I recommend that parents make good use of the detailed Table of Contents.<br /><br />\\"Teaching the Trivium,\\" however, is anything but a dry and objective look at a system of learning. It is heavily infused with the Bluedorns' worldview, which makes it a valuable resource for anyone wondering how homeschooling fits into Scriptural commands, how to tackle subjects from a strongly Christian perspective, or how classical education, generally thought of as pagan in origin, can be reconciled with the gospel (quite easily, the book claims--Trivium was God's idea, not man's, and we were created to learn by it).

I could not put this one down and ending up reading and finishing it late in the night. This novel has a depth and sensitivity toward the characters that was totally unexpected. I was thinking this would be a nice light Red Dress Ink read, but it totally surprised me! I really cared for and ached with the characters. I felt their struggles, their vulnerabilities. Previously I had enjoyed Rech's first novel, Losing It much more than average chick lit, but this book surpassed even her first one. I will certainly pick up any of Rech's future books! Thanks for providing chick lit that has real substance and heart!!	2005-10-10

All though many of them are very nice this is the first one I have ever been compelled to recommend. It may not have all the bells and whistles of costlier books but it explains the basics of observational drawing in a concise way that could be understood by beginning drawing students. The illustrations explain in a visual way what the author explains verbally and are easy to view and understand. This book would be the one to pick if you do not have an instructor and need to teach yourself. If you read the book and work from observation you will improve your drawing skills. I like the book so much I am selecting it for my students as the class text for Basic Drawing I. <br /> <br />If you are advanced drawing student and have the rudimentaries of drawing down then this may not be the book for you.	2005-10-10

Sure I've heard the Village People's infamous song many times over, but I had not previously imagined how complex these relationships were---or explored all reasons for the \\"Y\\"'s comparative decline as a homosocial/homosexual cruising site.<br /><br />Allegedly to avoid clogging the swimming pools with their cotton swim suits, many men at the \\"Y\\" simply elected to swim nude. Not attaching anything sexual to the action, both the men and the organization accepted it as a matter of fact that men would see each other naked at the \\"Y\\".<br /><br />The tension between people who wanted to keep things as they were and those who wanted the organization to project a 'family image' (hence the designation of \\"Family Y's\\" in post-war America) rivals any dramatic work which I've seen thus far. Considering the 'intense relationships' which they formed as consequence of working in the 'Y' movement, I also found it odd that some people in the YMCA would accuse their counterparts in the Young Women's Christian Association of being lesbians. These men had apparently absorbed the double-standards of their own day which negated women's public sphere influence.<br /><br />The admission of women as members into the previously all-male realm of the Y was also interesting. This move was another tactic to convince people---inside and outside the organization---nothing improper was happening. During it's history, the organization also faced criticisms of it's program.<br /><br />In 1912, the Portland, Oregon YMCA, with the ninth largest membership in North America, became the center of a sex scandal. A Portland newspaper charged many of the city's most prominent men with sodomy and delinquency of minors. A few of the implicated men lived at the YMCA and others used the sports facilities. This was the first time that a connection between the YMCA and homosexuality was publicly made.<br /><br />The organization continued struggling with the issue of homosexuality, but their 'front lines'--the desk clerks allegedly supposed to guard against homosexuality---looked the other way. In this closeted era, the YMCA was a critical meeting space for 'queer' young men.<br /><br />For all of the critical perspective, the book does praise it's subject. The \\"Y\\" pioneered racial unity AND sex education in an era when even many secular organizations lacked courage to even consider taking on the issue. I was especially heartened by the advocay of factually-based sex education, myself living in an era when so many other organizations with 'Christian' in their name actually advocate that people not have access to any of this information. How refreshing to read of an alternative---and in a much earlier era too!<br /><br />This book is part of the Chicago series on Sexuality, History and Society, but people wanting to read about YMCA history would also find it interesting because the authors have used very inclusive and broad 19th century framework to explore intimate relationships among men. Finally, it would be a good acquisition for people who are just interested in American history period, however altered from it's founding, the \\"Y\\" still exists as an institution and continues to promote racial justice and sex education. This is one of the scholarly works which professionals and the general public will both readily enjoy.s publicly made.

Ellen Foster is a novel of a young girl in search for a better life. it is a life story told in first person perspective. Ellen is only eleven years of age and yet lives a life with a mother who dies of a medication overdose and a drunk for a dad. after her fathers death, she is sent to live with her \\"mother's mother\\" who hates ellen for resembling her dads looks. Although ellen lives in a terrible environment, she never gives up on life. The fictional novel takes place in the south.I gave this novel 4 stars because of its everlasting interest. I would have given the novel 5 stars but it was confusing at first because of the context. I also gave it 4 stars because for me it is hard to enjoy a book if it doesn't interest me from the very start and this book caught my interest from the very first line of the first chapter. I really like the authors style of writing and how a couple of paragraphs will be about whats going on at her home with her dad and the next paragraphs will be about her new life, so it goes back and forth throughout the entire story. I reccommend this book to anyone who likes a great fictional novel that seems as though it is non-fiction or based on a true story, it is really that good!!! this was the first book i've read by author Kaye Gibbons but will definately not be the last. This was her first novel and coming out with such a powerful first novel has inspired me to read on to her next.	2005-10-10

What a great, great read!<br /><br />As an adult, I began to wonder why my body was betraying me: this poor, old stomach requires medication that a couple of generations ago didn't exist. Indeed, acid reflux wasn't here, either. Generations after ethnic family meals all but vanished, Schlosser points to what has wrecked us and how we keep getting sold fat, sugar, salt and lab-created flavors, smells and colors.<br /><br />With many educators putting Fast Food Nation on the required reading list, is it any surprise that high school and college students drink more water today than carbonated soda?<br /><br />Some people will remain obsessively stupid; like smokers, junk fooders will tune out the warnings and screw their tomorrows for a fix today. Crappy eating will continue for as long as we can churn out cheap grub for a minimum-waged, marginally-educated economy.

Following an introduction made through the thoughts and observations of a sexual predator, Broken Prey opens with the grizzly murder of a young woman who'd been scourged. Soon after, the sexual murder of a man is discovered. There seems to be little to connect the two until the authorities realize that both crimes included methods used by three currently incarcerated charismatic and powerful killers. <br /> <br />Lucas Davenport, working with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and his friend, Minneapolis Police Detective Sloan, get a crash course on interview techniques of the criminally insane when they visit the \\"Big Three\\" at St. John's hospital in an effort to figure out how they may be influencing the rampant escalation of heinous sex crimes from inside their isolation cells.  <br /> <br />Sandford introduces Ruffee Ignace, an egotistic, career-climbing Tribune reporter who has been contacted by the killer, giving him a public voice. Ignace is ruthless and willing to do anything for the story that will catapult him out of Minneapolis. I'm guessing we'll see him again!  <br /> <br />Luckily there are moments throughout the story like Davenport's search for the 100 Best Songs of the Rock Era for his new IPod. Most of the characters add their two cents worth, putting as much into their list choice as they do crime solving! Or there's Lucas' struggle to follow his Doctor-wife's \\"nutritional guidelines.\\" Lucas went home and ate a steak and onion low carb, low-fat microwave meal \\"that had apparently been purely made from coal tar and goobers perhaps seasoned with industrial phlegm.\\"  <br /> <br />Armchair Inteviews says: These humorous things provide welcome respites from the stress of wondering how close Sanford's plot follows real life psychotic sex murderers!

I purchased the book thinking to find insights.  Instead, I found the insinuation that if the reader be any less than a math geek, and particularly a game theoristic math geek, he would stand little hope to gain by setting out on the unhappy path to poker competence. <br /> <br />Game theory is behind the assumptions that machines utilize when they are evaluating such treacheries as how to annihilate an enemy without him annihilating you.  Although, to the best of my knowledge, no machine ever dreamt within its transistors of an al Quaeda (sp?) stealing an aeroplane and ramming it into the Pentagon.  Still, the geeks swear that, if they cannot annihilate the hostile user of the aeroplane, they will nonetheless annihilate all humanity from something so specifically human as poker.  Now, I'm very aware that machines are emotionless and \\"behave\\" as rationally as their encodings allow.  I am also aware that investors and gamblers, who are given to tremble in the slightest wind of entrepenurial adversity, would happily transcend their human condition for the beatitudes of a metallic immunity to such uncertainty and distress.  However, the passions and feelings, which the geeks among us villify and the rest of us fear, are mostly discredited because they go unharnessed in all but a few of us.  I would say that intuition is the culmination of an educated passion;  and for this reason I am most uncomfortable with authors and thinkers who want to substitute formulae for preparation.  This piece of philosophical tinker aside, game theory, which the author espouses as the great future of poker ideology, is ruined in its base assumption:  that men involved in games behave rationally.  Economists, who are the least rational people I know, huzzah this idea, and have gone about importing it into their hypotheses of economic behavior.  I suppose it makes them feel like generals.  And this despite almost everyone consistently behaving in anything but a rational--defined as self-interested--way where economics is concerned.  Welfare being one case in point, where the only participants behaving rationally selfishly in that game are its recipients. <br /> <br />What has all this to do with a geek playing poker?  The geek wishes to assure the reader that rationality is the centerpoint of the game of poker;  that rational definitions can completely describe that game;  and that machines will soon do it better than men.  What in truth the geek may be doing, is convincing himself he is behaving rationally, when he has wasted some several hundred thousand dollars of his parent's money on an ivy league education, by forthwith venturing out to play, not chess, but poker. <br /> <br />If you need an excuse to play poker, and you're an ivy leaguer, this book is for you.  If you're a bit lazy about learning how to derive pot odds, post flop betting strategy and the like, this book may also be for you.  If, however, you want to learn HOW to play poker--to the degree that it can be learned from books--read something a little more pedagogical, and a lot less biographical.	2005-10-10

Nonjudgemental, compassionate, yet making no attempt to hide the dysfunctional thought process of the protagonist, it tells about an escaped convict on the run. Lin arrives on a fake passport to Mumbai and falls in love with the place. When he runs out of money he moves to the slum, adjusting to the harsh life with a positive spirit that reminds you of Francie in A Tree grows in Brooklyn. Ten years of his life flood the 900 plus pages with a cast of characters that include village dacoits, pimps, passport forgers, palestinian fighters,Iranian army deserters, brothel madams with a KBG past. There is Prabhakar whose smile will stay with you after your book is done, Didier, the aging gay man who could have inspired Eliot to write The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock, the loveless Karla with a neglected childhood, the Palestinian who burns with hate, and countless other underworld characters who indulge in philosophy as an intellectual defense for their dark deeds. <br /> <br />This book falls short of a classic, partly because at times it spends too much time glorifying the underworld. Lin's life in crime really begins in Bombay, after his supposed spiritual rebirth working in a slum as a medic, something thats not well understood. For a fleeting moment you may wonder- has Lin has really reformed, or is this book a con job of a different kind, with a pen ? But things fall into place in the end. Unlike Captain Corelli's Mandolin, this is not a feel good book with sweet pure characters either (Prabhakar being the exception). At times you hate the protagonist himself for his actions, his gradual entry into crime. Yet its all out there, in the face. This is a story of survivors in a tough city, and Lin baba is the ultimate survivor of all.	2005-10-10

The main character is a gorgeous, scantily clad female.  Not that I have anything against gorgeous, scantily clad females, but when a book features dozens of splash pages, many of them two-page splash pages, it's usually a sign that the book is all glitz and eye-candy and lacking any story.  But a funny thing happened as I read this trade paperback collecting issues #1 - 4 of the series...I liked it.  I really liked it!  (with apologies to Sally Field).<br /><br />In a futuristic society where nearly all humans have some synthetic parts of some kind, Aphrodite is unique.  She is totally synthetic and was created in a lab.  Only she doesn't know it.  Created to be an ultra powerful assassin and to carry out the whims of the head of the Council, Aphrodite kills without remorse or feeling and does so brazenly and with incredible efficiency.  And, 15 minutes after her missions, she completely forgets them, retaining no memory of what she did or even what she is.  Her first hints come when she leaves herself a recording, prior to forgetting.  Then, she slowly begins to remember things in her dreams.  She remembers the people she's killed and she remembers the Council and the man she affectionately called \\"daddy\\" the scientist who created her.<br /><br />The more she remembers the more of a conscience she develops over her actions.  Aphrodite, the unstoppable assassin, fighting off security forces and a powerful cyborg named Abraxis, begins to piece together the clues of her mysterious life and finally comes face-to-face with the head of the council and learns all the secrets of her deadly past.<br /><br />Writer David Wohl borrows some themes from films and TV such as \\"The Matrix\\",  \\"The 6th day\\" and \\"Dark Angel\\" and comes up with an effective, if not altogether, original story.  I did find myself engrossed in Aphrodite's search for her background and the reason why she forgets her missions 15 minutes after completion.  Dave Finch's artwork is simply striking.  Yes there are a lot of splash pages but it is great stuff.  He shows Aphrodite as the perfect, sexy, yet vulnerable and confused and manipulated killer that she is.  The trade paperback also reprints all of the variant covers that were included in the regular comic series and a brief sketch gallery.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonminutes after completion.

This is a lousy book, in part because the premise is ludicrous. There cannot be a concise history of Latin America for the same reason that there cannot be a concise rendering of Newton's Principia. Thus, what professor Chasteen has provided is a concise overview of his personal prejudices, the vast majority of which he directs against (and here's a surprise) the United States and Europe. That these prejudices are personal is evident from the dedication (in which he states that his Latin American children are improving the US simply by their presence) until the meandering, pointless fizzling out of his discussion 250 pages later. The history is mediocre, at best, and some of Chasteen's opinions are so ridiculous (any historian who singles out the Carter administration's foreign policies for admiration has been hitting the bong a little too hard) that you have to wonder why he continues to live in a country he so plainly abhors.    The writing is so saturated with neoliberal condescension that professor Chasteen's acknowledgement to the over 100 students who read the manuscript seems a wholly fitting exercise, given that they may well have written the dreadful thing.	2005-10-10

I thought Harry Bosch a third rate Philip Marlowe and his noir novels of LA bad Dashiell Hammett.  However, he can turn a phrase and his Bosch books remind me of a quote I read in a review of Robert Ludlum, \\"This book was so bad, I stayed up until 3:00am to see how it turned out\\".<br /><br />Then I read \\"The Poet\\".  I loved this book!  Jack McAvoy is at best a good newspaper writer/bad detective and thoroughly unsympathetic.  The female agent, the macho male FBI agent, the shady Division head and the editor putting the deadline as the bottom line are all unsympathetic characters which strike me as a much more fitting description of real life than the sanitized heroes and villains we see on TV and read in the books by lesser authors.<br /><br />There is no rhyme or reason as to the motives of the murderer when this person is dscovered.  The way in which he disposes of the cops in question is genuinely creepy and extremely believeable.  I will never read Poe again without thinking of \\"The Poet.\\"<br /><br />If Mr.  Connelly would get away from Harry Bosch and write more books like this one, he would be in the league of Thomas Harris, (Before \\"Hannibal\\")and Brian Moore.  Right now he is in the triple AAA leagues of mystery writers, worlds better than the Pattersons, North Pattersons and other hacks, but not quite great.<br /><br />\\"The Poet\\" is a great mystery.

In 1882, when author Willa Cather was nine years-old, her family left their home in Back Creek Valley, Virginia, and moved to Nebraska, near the settler country in Red Cloud where they farmed a homestead. Ms. Cather, often thought of as a chronicler of the pioneer American West, frequently drew on her memories of prairie culture and her own personal experiences. She wrote about the themes closest to her heart. Of primary importance was the drama of the immigrant struggling to survive in a new world, epitomized here in \\"My Antonia.\\" In this extraordinary novel, Miss Cather weaves together the story of Antonia Shimerda, an immigrant girl from Bohemia who represents the optimism, determination and pure grit that newcomers to America needed to make a successful life, and that of American-born Jim Burden, our narrator.<br /><br />Burden, a successful and cultured East-coast lawyer, is returning to his childhood home in Blackhawk, Nebraska for a visit. On the long train ride, he reminisces with an unnamed friend about the place where they had both grown up and about the people they knew - especially their dear friend Antonia, \\"who seemed to mean to us the country, the conditions, the whole adventure of our childhood.\\"<br /><br />When young Jim Burden was orphaned at age ten, he left his native Virginia to live with his grandparents on their farm, just outside of Blackhawk. At almost the same time that Jim arrived, the Shimerda family settled on their land. Mrs. Shimerda had argued effectively for a move to America so that the children, especially Ambrosch, the eldest son, would have the chance to make a better life for themselves, with more possibilities of moving up in the social hierarchy and of acquiring wealth. The Bohemian newcomers were the Burden's closest neighbors. Fourteen year-old Antonia Shimerda, the eldest daughter became a close friend of Jim's. He was immediately drawn to her warmth and friendliness. When Antonia's father, a sensitive, refined man, discovered that Jim was educated he asked the boy to teach his daughter to speak English. \\"Te-e-ach, te-e-ach my &Aacute;n-tonia!\\" he told/asked Mrs. Burden. Together the two young people worked the land and explored the glorious prairie. And Antonia began to learn English.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Antonia's studies came to an end with her father's tragic suicide. The man missed his native land terribly and was not able to accept his family's extreme poverty or the demands of his wife and son. When he lost his only friends, he sunk into a deep depression from which he was not able to escape. After Mr. Shimerda's death, Antonia had to work even harder, performing the heaviest, most physically demanding chores, just to keep the farm from going under. She was not able to go to school with Jim, and began to slowly lose the refined ways she had learned from her dad.<br /><br />The author describes Antonia's life as Jim perceives it, and from information he gathers from others about the long periods when he did not have contact with her. Their widely different positions in society dictated their life choices and their fortunes. And their lives, their personal histories, parallel the changes and the transformation of the Great Plains. When Antonia and Jim explored the Nebraskan wilderness, it was a wilderness as far as the eye could see. \\"There seemed to be nothing to see; no fences, no creeks or trees, no hills or fields. If there was a road, I could not make it out in the faint starlight. There was nothing but land: not a country at all, but the material out of which countries are made. No, there was nothing but land--slightly undulating...\\" And, \\"I had the feeling that the world was left behind, that we had got over the edge of it, and were outside man's jurisdiction. I had never before looked up at the sky when there was not a familiar mountain ridge against it. But this was the complete dome of heaven, all there was of it.\\" When Jim makes his return trip by train, years later, everything had changed.<br /><br />Willa Cather's prose is straightforward, the narrative is deceptively simple and crystal clear. Her characters are complex and the wonderful, richly textured descriptions of the landscape and life on the plains make reading the novel pure pleasure. The author also captures the interior landscape of her characters with great perception and sensitivity. This is a great work of fiction which depicts a people, and a place in time, which only remain on the pages of a book, preserved vividly by Willa Cather.<br /><br />This Barnes and Nobel Classic Edition provides an Introduction and Notes by Gordon Tapper, author and Assistant Professor of English at De Pauw University, as well as a biography of Willa Cather, and a chronology of her life and work; a timeline of significant events that provides the book's historical context; an outline of key themes and plot points; and discussion questions ideal for book club conversations.<br /><br />H.L.

It's difficult to heap enough praise on Domenic Priore's book about SMiLE. This is a detailed, multi-leveled analysis of SMiLE-- every aspect of the southern California music scene is analyzed, especially every detail that relates to Brian Wilson's failed attempt to get SMiLE off the ground in 1967. Some reviewers have suggested that Priore strays from the topic too often. Not so. He is simply laying out a solid case for his reasons why SMiLE was created, then sabotaged in 1967. There are two recent excellent books that are comparable: \\"Positively 4th Street: The Lives and Times of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, Mimi Baez Farina and Richard Farina\\" by David Hajdu, and \\"Birth Of The Cool : Beat, Bebop, and the American Avant Garde\\" by Lewis MacAdams.  What these books have in common with Priore's is that you feel you are getting a real picture of the whole scenerio because of the way the authors fit all the historical pieces together.        If I were Beach Boy singer Mike Love, I would not be happy about the release of this book. Priore interviews people with close connections to Brian and the band and reports on evidence (such as Love's verbal attack on \\"Surf's Up\\" right in front of the cameras as they were recording Brian's solo performance of the track for a TV special about the importance of popular music) to make the case that Love was little more than a musically shallow, abusive control freak who would stop at nothing to destroy SMiLE, even if it meant destroying Brian in the process.  There's even better evidence than this in the book, but I'll leave it to the truly curious to read all the gory details.          It's no small thing that Brian Wilson wrote the forward for this book. SMiLE lyricist Van Dyke Park is interviewed extensively and writes his own forward in which he states \\"...Priore has given an accurate and detailed account of the creation of this celebrated work.\\"            Heaping insult on injury, Priore even tags the remaining band members with the dreaded \\"conservative\\" political label for doing campaign rallies in support of George Bush (Sr.). The very thought of a band that was once stood at the brink of the counterculture supporting the heartlessness of the U.S. right wing (bash the poor, scapegoat the minorities) is nauseating.  However, considering the way the band, or at least Mike Love, helped to sabotaged SMiLE, it makes a kind of sick, sad sort of sense.          After SMiLE, The Beach Boys would go on to record some mediocre albums, and despite a few pieces reflecting the band's growing interest in inner peace and meditation, they would come nowhere close to the peak experience of SMiLE.         Like the fans described in Priore's book, I'm one of those who came to SMiLE through cassette tape excerpts circulated by fans I met on the Internet. Not having been a Beach Boys fan during their heyday, I quickly saw that SMiLE was one of the most amazing works of pop music from the psychedelic era. The book documents the turn of events that lead Brian to re-recording, from scratch, the SMiLE song cycle in 2004, with Van Dyke Parks back as lyrical collaborator. The triumph of the album, despite Brian's aged vocal cords, reveals that when we lost SMiLE in 1967, we lost not only that album but the possibility of a whole series of works of equal brilliance, since the band retreated to standard rock fare and eventually to Beach Boys early 60s nostalgia.            Mike Love can meditate from now until the cows come home, but he'll never have one ounce of the artistic brilliance that Brian exhibited in the creation of the psychedelic era's most progressive work, SMiLE. Nor was Love even able to recognize how good it was, attacking both the music and the esoteric lyrics of Van Dyke Parks. We must thank Dominic Priore for giving us an intimate glimpse into one of pop music's most interesting creations, tragically sacrificed because of others short-sightedness. The comfort we get is that the artwork finally saw the light of day, creativity finally triumphed, even if it took almost 40 years for the birth to be complete.	2005-10-10

The African agreed with this as well. \\"Then how could it be witchcraft?\\"<br /><br />\\"Ah,\\" said the African, \\"the fact the the man and the snake happened to be there at the exact same time- *that* was witchcraft!\\"<br /><br />Reading Richard Powers novels often puts me in mind of that story, and perhaps there is no better example than Gain. As is often the case in Powers' novels, there are two seemingly unconnected- or tenuously connected at best- threads, seperated by time. One story is that of an old-line American company- you could be forgiven for thinking Lever Brother or perhaps Proctor and Gamble- slowly making its way from humble beginnings to becoming a major industrial power, proceeding in fits and starts, and always thinking of the customer and the employees. In a somewhat different time frame, a divorced woman is living her life as she believes best for her and her children. And yet, with good intentions all along the way, something terrible happens that no one seems to be to blame for- and yet someone must be.<br /><br />This is one of Powers' most affecting books, I think, and one that will both move most readers and prompt them to examine many of their beliefs about justice and responsibility.	2005-10-10

Note the ISM.  This is not about global trade or global economics but rather about the ISM that commands that these are inevitable and must take priority over national security, quality of life, job security, law and order. <br /> <br />For 30 years academicians have worked to undermine countries, including the USA itself, by demanding that such countries are obsolete.  As an American, I note that we are a country of laws and these folks worked to undermine law.  They worked to undermine democracy and choice.  They worked to convert the world to a single unelected government run by corporate cronies.  This is globalism. <br /> <br />Most have never heard of it.  Many will not believe it.  Yet this is no conspiracy theory or work of fiction.  This treason drove our politicians over the past decades thus producing in large part the ineffectual incompetencies of our leadership in that period.  It also drove the widespread attacks on the middle class and our quality of life. <br /> <br />The story is magnificent.  The book documents a wide range of little known fact and links them into the rise of neo-conservatism and neo-liberalism.   <br /> <br />I find the author's writing a bit forced, a bit ponderous, but the material is worth getting past his quirks.  Some bit of save-the-world ideology is also included, but must be in these kinds of treatise. <br /> <br />Buy it, read it, and then understand why your congressman and senator have sold you out, turned their back on Democracy, and become slaves to corporate corruption.  Understand WHY AMERICA WENT WRONG.	2005-10-10

Chantal Sicile-Kira's goal is to save parents \\"countless hours of precious time and heartache\\" by sharing what she has learned navigating through the various systems.  She has an autistic child of her own and she knows the ropes having spent \\"tens of thousands of hours\\" learning about autism and the treatments and interventions available, and how the various support and governmental groups and organizations work.<br /><br />She begins by debunking myths about autism while providing a little history including some sharp commentary about Bruno Bettelheim, the psychotherapist who thought that autism was caused by \\"refrigerator mothers\\" of cold affect who pushed their children into emotional isolation.  She emphasizes that autism is a \\"spectrum disorder\\" that is becoming more and more prevalent without a clear etiology.<br /><br />She follows this with a chapter explaining what ASDs are and \\"How to Know If a Person Has One.\\"  She addresses herself to parents who have absolutely no experience with autism, parents who have no idea what to do or how to feel.  In Chapter 3 she looks into the causes and attempts to explain why people with ASDs act the way they do.  Then she guides parents to what to expect and what to do after a diagnosis of autism.  In Chapter 5 she comments on treatments, therapies, and interventions.<br /><br />What Sicile-Kira does so well is to make the reader understand and appreciate what it is like to be a parent of an autistic child, what family life can be like with siblings, what the educational prospects are, how one fits into the community and what the future may hold.  Autism spectrum disorders are becoming better and better understood all the time, and there is even a school of thought that suggests that, in their milder forms, to look for a \\"cure\\" may be a misdirection because many autistics have a unique and valuable way of viewing the world and living life.<br /><br />This is a personal book, but it is also a professional book.  There is an appendix giving \\"Parent Ratings of Behavioral Effects of Biomedical Interventions\\": which drugs have or have not been effective, how non-drug supplements have or have not helped, and the effect of special diets.  There is a section on \\"Resources,\\" including ASD-Specific Organizations, general organizations, governmental agencies, books; and there's a bibliography.<br /><br />If you want an introduction to autism and the world of autism from a parental and a professional point of view, this is an excellent place to start.orld and living life. <br /> <br />This is a personal book, but it is also a professional book.

That usually works to the detriment of a series like this one where the byplay between Nero and Archie is the real reason for this series success; however, the stories in this collection are at least interesting diversions, if not as satisfying as the novels. <br />\\"The Gun with Wings\\" is a \\"locked room\\" mystery with a rather familiar \\"Gideon Fell\\" feel to it; and \\"Bullet for One\\" has more than its fair share of annoying characters, a fairly forgettable plot, but is slightly redeemed by memorable scene in an office where a Marx Brothers style romp occurs with Archie as a bemused bystander. <br />The winner here is \\"Disguise for Murder\\" which proves to be a lot of fun. Wolfe's aversion to disturbance in his household is overshadowed by his love of showing off his orchids. This proves to be a huge problem as murder occurs in his office, and then the unthinkable happens: Inspector Cramer shuts down Wolfe's sanctuary as a crime scene. Wolfe in high dudgeon is always a treat and the added attraction of Archie in jeopardy ranks this with the best of the Wolfe tales. One classic and two also rans make this a acceptable deal and CURTAINS FOR THREE with your time.  <br />	2005-10-10

After reading the lukewarm reviews, I was very hesitant and did not have high hopes for a great story. I found a great adventure within the pages of The Cestus Deception as well as political intrigue and a touching love story. <br /> <br />The plot of the book centers around Jedi Knights Obi-Wan Kenobi and Kit Fisto traveling to the planet of Ord Cestus on a mission. Cestus Cybernetics, a local manufacturing firm, has started producing droids unofficially called \\"Jedi Killers\\" or JK droids. One was brought back to Coruscant to be tested and it proved to be a worthy and almost unbeatable opponent, easily defeating an ARC trooper and giving Fisto a run for his money, although he did defeat it. Kenobi and Fisto were sent to Ord Cestus to try and stop the manufacturing of these droids. Chancellor Palpatine instructed that he would like to see the matter settled diplomatically, but if things got worse, other forms of \\"diplomacy\\" were OK too. Things got worse and the Jedi had to get creative in their dealings. I will leave it at that as to not spoil the fun. <br /> <br />One complaint that I read about in another review was the inordinate number of chapters (over 70). Yes, there are some chapters that only take up a page, others take up a few. The way I look at it is like this: Think of a movie and how often the scenes change, some scenes only lasting a handful of seconds. It is a way for the viewer to keep up on what's going on with other characters at other settings. I liken this book to a movie where the author is just keeping the reader up to speed on what's going on everywhere else. So, a one page chapter is like a 10 second scene in a movie. The shifts didn't bother me in the least and I think the author chose the right times to \\"cut to the next scene\\". <br /> <br />Another complaint I saw was the fact that Nate (later dubbed Jangotat), an ARC trooper, fell in love with one of the localson Ord Cestus. Personally, I think this side story unfolded at a good pace, not rushed, and was very touching. And, I also believe it's true to life. I'd be willing to bet that in the course of world history, soldiers in wars have fallen in love with a local. Why not in this story? Nate is still human and has merely been trained to tune out emotions. He still has them and they start coming out when he meets Sheeka Tull. Did that make him soft? Absolutely not. Read the book and judge for yourself. <br /> <br />I would encourage everyone to give this book a chance. I am not a writer, merely a reader and fan of Star Wars novels. I read books like I watch movies; I keep an open mind and just relax and enjoy the story, ignoring technical flaws and plot holes. I enjoyed the main story as well as the side stories that accompanied it. Although Barnes didn't personify clone troopers as well as Karen Traviss did in Hard Contact and his writing style may not be technically perfect, The Cestus Deception is worth your time. May the Force be with you!	2005-10-10

I will keep mine short.  The author of the book is hostile to Christianity and hides behind supposed scholarship.  The book is largely biased opinions.  If one strains, one can find some useful information.  For anyone who wants to see the author's bias most clearly, get a copy of the book and look at the last page of the last chapter.  There, the author puts forth such an absurd anti-Christian, anti-Bible, and anti-American vision that the rest of the book is put clearly into the context from which the author writes.

He has the audacity to repeat an entire chapter, verbatim, under another heading in the book. There was absolutely nothing, and I can't emphasize this enough, nothing in this book that informed me of anything new, or significant. What really piqued me was he included \\"free\\" copies of his newsletters, which too contained nothing! He claims that Good Morning America, or was it the Today Show, that had embarked on a campaign to discredit him and his findings. He also claims that he refused to be interviewed by them as they showed up at his residence unannounced, intrusively, and very threatening.

With it being set in the 1950s & in New York, I was in heaven & very much so wished that I could be right there in the middle of this mystery. The author did a fantastic job with her imagery; I felt that all I needed was my own detective kit & Frank Sinatra singing \\"New York New York\\" & could (somehow) magically be right there with Paige. <br /> <br />The story had twists, kept me guessing (which I love!), & was very witty & smart. I often find that with a book in a series such as this one (Paige Turner Mysteries), I easily get tired of the main character. This novel was not that way for me at all. I could see growth in Paige & I found myself wishing that I was her best friend. Also, in reading this second book, I saw change & growth in the author's writing- it became more refreshed, more exhilarating, & even more smart! It was a very enjoyable read!	2005-10-10

For me, however, it at times seemed rather flat, like a carbonated drink that has been sitting opened for a few hours.  I think the pace of the book was too slow, given that the plot is a rather simple one. But let's start with some plus's.<br /><br />I loved the extensive coverage of alien ruins and alien artifacts. These scenes -- and there are many -- were great fun.  Whenever the adventurers entered a jungle clearing and found an alien temple or structure, surprises were many and the reader suddenly sat up on the edge of his (or her) chair.<br /><br />One of the very most fun alien discoveries was the skyhook anchor, found circling the planet in a far orbit.  And the flora and fauna of the planet \\"Deepsix\\" were great fun also.  Encountering dangerous alien life forms while chopping through the rain forest -- this is great entertainment.  Especially since McDevitt does a great job bringing it all to life.<br /><br />But back to a few problems.  The author creates a character named MacAllister, and seems to want us to dislike him.  I mean, this guy is portrayed as a real jerk.  Self-important, pompous, and continually abrasive with anyone who crosses his path.  MacAllister is a journalist and writer who has attained a great reputation.  He has come to feel he is beyond criticism, and has an unpleasant sense of his own superiority.<br /><br />Well, you ask, 'what's the problem?'  Lots of books have unattractive characters.  Here's the problem.  MacAllister dominates the book.  Every -- yes, EVERY -- chapter begins with a lengthy quotation from MacAllister. These don't come to anything, and I began skipping them.  Also, the author seems to push MacAllister forward to dominate so many scenes in the book.  I asked myself, 'why do I need to continually cope with this unpleasant person?'  MacAllister is not even interesting as a character.  He is one dimensional -- a \\"one-note Johnny.\\"  He has no range, just being a crusty curmudgeon chapter after chapter.<br /><br />As I said when I began this review, Deepsix needs major editing with respect to the element of 'pace.'  It just moves too SLOW.  too many chapters go by while the author is still introducing the setting and introducing a long string of characters, some of whom prove rather insignificant in the overall story.<br /><br />Sub-plots that have little linkage to the main plot keep pulling us away from the main story, just when we are beginning to get highly involved. This 430-page book could easily shed 150 pages and be a better novel for it.<br /><br />There are some well-drawn and interesting characters that help to power the book.  These include the woman \\"Hutch\\" and the burned out aging explorer Nightingale.<br /><br />One writer compared this novel to the best of Arthur C. Clarke.  Well, there are some resemblances, especially the fascinating alien artifacts that excite the reader about extraterrestrial civilizations.  And there is some hard science extrapolated, such as the skyhook technology that shows up in Deepsix.<br /><br />But all in all, we are not talking the same level of quality.  Comparing McDevitt to Arthur C. Clarke is like comparing vin ordinaire with the finest burgundies of France.ng a crusty curmudgeon chapter after chapter. <br /> <br />As I said when I began this review, Deepsix needs major editing with respect to the element of 'pace.'

This biography is a companion volume to Bliss's outstanding biography of the great William Osler. Together, these biographies tell the story not only of their subjects but also of the rise of North American medicine from provincial status to equality, and in some respects superiority, with the great clinical centers of Europe.  Harvey Cushing was the first great pioneering surgeon produced by the USA or Canada.  As much as a single person can be said to generate a field, Cushing was the progenitor of neurosurgery.  Born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, Cushing was the product of a line of respected physicians of New England extraction.  From his parents, he inherited a Puritan sense of mission, rectitude, and a remarkable dedication to work.  Educated at Harvard Medical School, he sought post-graduate training at the epicenter of the revolution in American medical education that was Johns Hopkins University Hospital.  At Hopkins he became a protege of Osler and started his surgical career under the direction of the outstanding and rather erratic William Halstead.  Ambitious and remarkably diligent, Cushing set out to make his mark by pioneering an area of surgery avoided by other pioneering surgeons - brain surgery.  A remarkably facile technical surgeon, Cushing was obsessed with improving all aspects of surgical care, including use of careful clinical diagnostic methods, improvement of anesthetic management, and post-operative care.  Despite formidable obstacles, Cushing succeeded in creating a new discipline.  His methods were adopted widely and his trainees became the founding neurosurgeons in many regions.  Bliss gives a vivid impression of surgical practice in this period and of Cushing's innovations.  To read these sections is to appreciate the remarkable progress made in the last century.  At the end of his career, Cushing was pleased to attain 10% operative mortality for operations on intracranial tumors, a figure that seems horrifying today.  Bliss is careful to note Cushing's considerable defects.  He was a stringent, sometimes abusive preceptor.  His ambition was manifested not only by his drive to do the utmost to improve clinical care but also by considerable arrogance.  He inspired great loyalty but seems to  have been respected rather than loved by many.  He was a difficult husband and an absentee father.  But while his relations with colleagues and trainees could be stormy, in his treatment of patients he appears to have behaved with compassion and tact.  Bliss does a good job of putting Cushing's achievements in the context of broader developments.  While Cushing became the most famous American surgeon with a substantial international reputation, other American surgeons, like Halstead, George Crile and the Mayo brothers, were producing substantial improvements in surgical practice.<br /><br />Its impossible to avoid comparing this book with the Osler book.  In terms of scholarship and quality of writing, this book is on par with the Osler biography.  Still, this is not quite as enjoyable a read, largely for 2 reasons.  The Osler biography is also the story of the institutional maturation of American/Canadian medicine, a remarkable story.  Cushing's development of a new surgical discipline is not qute as impressive as the institutional transformation accomplished by Osler's generation.  As the subject of a biography, Cushing is also not as attractive a personality as Osler.  Bliss depicts Cushing as a remarkable man and Bliss clearly respects and admires Cushing.  Osler, on the other hand, inspires not only respect and admiration, but also affection.  Regardless, this Cushing biography is first-rate and combined with the Osler book, gives a peerless impression of American/Canadian medicine in its first flush of maturity.nial tumors, a figure that seems horrifying today.

She's a gutsy young woman who somehow survives the many scrapes and dangerous situations she manages to get herself into. While Jacky is tough on the outside, she is still all girl on the inside, which makes her also tender when she needs to be. She's loyal to her mates and cheerful no matter what. We share in her love of life and cheer her on. We also feel her sadness...as when, after having fallen deeply in love with Jaime, she is separated from him at the end. I'm sure this part brought a tear to many a reader's eye. I'm currently reading  book two: CURSE OF THE BLUE TATTOO. It's even more packed with misadventures than the first book.

After reading the first three examples and the \\"hidden\\" messages, I was completely disappointed and returned the book.  I found that I didn't even need to finish reading the chapter to guess at what the message was.  In one of the chapters, Pantley uses an example from her own parenting.  I thought, okay, now she's going to share with us one of her mistakes and how she learned from it, and was about to give her some credit for being honest with her readers.  Unfortunately for me, in this example she comes out having done everything correctly (not doing her child's homework project for him) and a number of her son's classmates' parents are in the wrong.  Don't we all know that the child should do his/her OWN homework?  And maybe by not allowing him/her to do the homework, we are saying that he/she isn't capable of doing it?  Or that mom or dad will always be available to tackle the complicated stuff?  I don't think that we need a book to figure that out.  These messages are anything but subtle.	2005-10-10

But recently I decided that I needed something more, something that would give me correct pronounciation as well as grammar rules and conjugating verbs.  After reading many reviews here on amazon.com, I went with Pimsleur, and I'm quite happy that I did.  The lessons make sense and the conversations are cheeky and entertaining.    [...]and bought the Quick and Simple program first; I loved it and it worked for me, so I went ahead and invested in the Comprehensive I program (I bought it from amazon.com's New and Used marketplace because otherwise it's far too expensive for me).  I've just finished it and I have to say, it's a quality program.  As I posted in my Madrigal review, I'm a foreign-language-dummy, and find it exceedingly difficult to learn languages, even one as relatively simple as Spanish.  But with Pimsleur I feel I learned a lot in just 30 half-hour lessons, and will definitely buy Levels II and III.    However, it's not a perfect system.  I fully admit that if my live-in fianc was not Cuban-American and fluent in Spanish, I might not have stuck with this program.  Because he listened to most of my lessons, he knew what I was learning and could ask me questions from my lessons at random, and this helped me immensely.  I could also ask him questions if something didn't quite make sense to me; and I admit that once, towards the end of the lessons, I had to reference a certain grammar rule in Madrigal to figure out what the lesson was all about.    Although the program advises doing a lesson a day straight through, I did have to take a day off now and then, and I recently had to take the entire week off.  Life is just like that.  It didn't seem to have any large, adverse affects on my learning.  I did find that when I did do my lessons I had to devote all my attention to them; trying to engage in mindless activity, even just getting up to get a glass of water, while doing the lessons threw me off and made me make silly mistakes.    If you're serious about learning a foreign language, I can think of no better at-home system than Pimsleur; even university classes and private tutoring I've invested in aren't as good as this.  But I'd definitely get some backup, such as a grammar book (Madrigal is great).  If there is someone close to you who speaks fluent Spanish, then definitely use them as a resource.  If Pimselur is all you have, then I really don't think you'll learn as much as you should, but if you're serious about learning and you invest a little extra time (and possibly money) outside the Pimsleur program, you'll be speaking Spanish in no time.	2005-10-10

Set in Cloisterham, a cathedral town, Dickens's final novel, unfinished, introduces two elements unusual for Dickens--opium-eating and the church.  In the opening scene, John Jasper, music teacher and soloist in the cathedral choir, awakens from an opium trance in a flat with two other semi-conscious men and their supplier, an old woman named Puffer, and then hurries off to daily vespers.<br /><br />Jasper, aged twenty-six, is the uncle and guardian of Edwin Drood, only a few years younger. Drood has been the fianc&eacute; of Rosa Bud for most of his life, an arrangement made by his and Rosa's deceased fathers to honor their friendship, and the wedding is expected within the year.  Jasper, Rosa's music teacher, is secretly in love with her, though she finds him repellent.<br /><br />When two orphans, Helena and Neville Landless, arrive in Cloisterham, Helena and Rosa become friends, and Neville finds himself strongly attracted to the lovely Rosa.  Ultimately, the hot-tempered Neville and Drood have a terrible argument in which Neville threatens Drood before leaving town on a walking trip.  Drood vanishes the same day.  Apprehended on his trip, Neville is questioned about Drood's disappearance, and Jasper accuses him of murder.<br /><br />Tightly organized to this point, the novel shows Jasper himself to be a prime suspect, someone who could have engineered the evidence against Neville, but Dickens unexpectedly introduces some new characters at this point--the mysterious Dick Datchery and Tartar, an old friend of Rev. Mr. Crisparkle, minor canon at the cathedral.  Puffer, the opium woman, is reintroduced and appears set to play a greater role, since she solicits  information from the semi-conscious Jasper and secretly follows him.  This is the halfway point in the projected novel, and Dickens clearly planned to develop these new (or reintroduced) characters to deepen the mystery.<br /><br />More modern in many ways than his previous novels, the characters here are not simple stereotypes--some are good people who have real flaws and make mistakes.  Dickens's tying of Jasper to the church choir, where he was a soloist, suggests some examination of the theme of hypocrisy, in which the good Mr. Crisparkle would be Jasper's antithesis.  The opium scenes, vividly drawn, carry the unusual suggestion that opium leads to a kind of intoxication similar to that of alcohol, and Dicken does not use these scenes to offer dire warnings about the drug--at least at this point.

(For the reviewers who think it is racist, why do Indian bookstores feature this book then?)<br /><br />After reading the amazing story of the Oatman family and what happened to them, I understood the reason why Americans rose up and insisted that the government squelch Indian uprisings in the West and Southwest.  This book destroyed many popular myths in my mind about Indian culture and American English culture in the 19th century. It also reveals a lot of detail about the way these two sub tribes of the Apache & Mohave Nations lived. The good and the bad are depicted side by side. For example, the Oatman girls were apparently never molested by the Apache or the Mohave, but they were treated pretty harshly at times (not to mention the unprovoked murder of their parents).<br />The account of the difference in lifestyle between the two tribes that held the Oatman girls is also very interesting (at least for me it was fascinating). It was like looking back into history and seeing things from a perspective you would NEVER see in the movies.<br /><br />It shows that the tribes varied quite a bit, and that America was reluctant to send out the Cavalry-at least in this case. But this book may have been the trigger that changed the reluctance into a \\"righteous\\" indignation.<br /><br />I think it also reveals something about one Mormon family who travelled (or tried to travel) to California...and what happened to them on the way. The spirituality of the family (if the account is accurate) is remarkable and the customs of other religious people around them are as well. (I'm not a Mormon). The book is not about spreading religion, but does exhibit the religious practice and character of many of the people in the story in detail.<br /><br />This book shows how the US government was slow to rescue people who were captives...and how the power of the free press turned that around. For when this book was first published, it was a best seller in the USA. The newspapers in the west coast apparently splashed this story throughout LA. Apparently it created a groundswell public outcry that the military provide safer passageways across this vast land.<br /><br />I think every American should be required to read this as part of a US History class. I'm sure some of the accounts are hyped a bit...but one cannot help but feel they are looking into history from the authentic eyes of a 19th century history shaping author.  And that it brings one far closer to something that happened, that may have been very important to changing the way the US Government dealt with Indian tribes out west, even though it is clear not all tribes acted as the ones in this book did.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!ok was first published, it was a best seller in the USA.

The book is okay, if repetitious, and certainly engaging enough as Lawford seems to vacillate between considering himself one hot dude and a loser who is a \\"second string Kennedy.\\" But what bothers me the most about this book is the egregious number of spelling errors and the above-mentioned repetition. About the only name he spells right is his own! Further, he spells some names variously, e.g. \\"Davie\\" and \\"Davy\\" on the same page. His own grandmother isn't immune: Is it \\"May\\" or \\"Mae,\\" Chris? I certainly hope someone takes a blue pencil to this book before it's issued in paperback; such sloppiness is just unacceptable.  Special apology to the late Jack \\"Lemon\\" [sic], as well as Jimmy Van \\"Husen,\\" and Dominick \\"Dunn.\\" (Well, Lawford doesn't have much use for Dunne, so maybe that one is intentional.)    In its favor, the book is absorbing; however, though it purports to be about Chris Lawford and his journey through the hell of addiction and toward the \\"sunlit\\" days of sobriety, the fact remains that there is still plenty of \\"Kennedyiana\\" and Hollywood gossip in which Peter Lawford comes off poorly. One seems to be asked to admire Christopher for loving his father anyway, and granted, that cannot have been easy to do. The inescapable fact remains that if Chris were the son of Peter Lawford--a second-rate, all-but-forgotten actor and world-class substance abuser--and \\"Patricia Smith,\\" there would have been no interest in this book. But I'm sure he knows that, and thanks to his hardwon sobriety, no doubt accepts it, as well.    One final note to the author: Chris, a lot of men who weren't breast fed get on with women just fine.

Not gospel thought	`The Cook's Bible' by `Cook's Illustrated' founder and editor in chief, Christopher Kimball is a terrific culinary read, based on the unusual collection of subjects and opinions on a truly wide range of culinary topics. In many ways, the book reads very much like any one of a dozen `Cooks Illustrated' cookbooks, assembled from related articles from their magazine. The main difference is that the focus here is much more on equipment and techniques than on specific recipes.<br /><br />One has to wonder what entitles the author to call this a `Bible'. What comes to mind is that this is a complete source of informantion and it's advice is simply beyond question. Unfortunately, the charm and interest one has in this book has nothing to do with either completeness or authoritativeness. While it is accurate on many, many things, it's word is not `gospel'!<br /><br />The interest in reading this book comes mostly from the charm, wit, and good humor of the author's writing. I get the sense of reading a culinary Garrison Keillor in very much the same way I get that sense when I read James Peterson's books or even Julia Child's early books. You don't get the same bald humor that you see in Alton Brown's books, but the details of the culinary advice is as good or better than Alton Brown's recipes; however, Kimball's advice on cooking equipment is not as good as in Alton Brown's `Gear for Your Kitchen'. This is not because Brown's insights are deeper, it's because he focuses on laying out what it is you should do to evaluate what works best for you in the world of kitchen gear, and deals in general principles rather than on a magazine staff's notions of whats good and what's not. For example, while Kimball recommends Wustoff knives over all other makes, a recent `Consumer's Report' article rates Henkels knives above all others, including Wustoff. Now I am certain `Cook's Illustrated' has a better handle on what makes a good chef's knive, but this shows how different people see things differently. Another weakness of Kimball's equipment evaluations is that there is always the risk that one or more models on his evaluations will be discontinued.<br /><br />One reason I enjoy reading Kimball so much, both in this book and in his `Cooks Illustrated' editorial pages is that it is such great fun to disagree with him on some points. For example, his very first sentence in the introduction states that there is little in common between gourmet cooking and home cooking (and Kimball's aim is to talk about home cooking). I argue that there is less difference between my cooking and that of Tom Colicchio and Alfred Portale than there is between the average weekend golfer and Tiger Woods. I use the same techniques, the same equipment, and very nearly the same quality of ingredients. Acting on Kimball's premise can lead to major mistakes, such as what I saw in the new Culinary Institute of America book on `Breakfasts and Brunches' where scrambled eggs and omelets are pictured as being only small variations on the same technique. Kimball, on the other hand, correctly treats omelets and scrambled eggs as two different techniques, even thought they start with virtually identical ingredients.<br /><br />Like James Peterson, Kimball has a very commonsensical approach to things, which means he is much more inclined to see things for what they are. My favorite example is his take on the microwave. While it is certainly fast for certain jobs, this speed is actually a liability when it comes to many other jobs, as it means the margin between good results and a disaster is that much smaller. And, it is a technique which is highly variable by the amount of food put into the box. When one potato can take 8 minutes, two potatoes can take 15. This would not be true in a conventional oven or in boiling water. Another problem with the microwave is that checking on things and adding ingredients is a real nuisance, especially when the cooking vessel gets very hot. This down to earth approach will also reveal, now and then, some very counterintuitive facts about cooking methods. I know it is very hard to believe this, but Kimball explains, with practically no Alton Brown style handwaving, how and why a braised piece of meat (cooked for a long time half covered with liquid), will actually come out dryer than with some other methods if the cooking is done at too high a temperature.<br /><br />Next to the extremely commonsensical approach to things, I really like Kimball's diagrams on how to do certain tasks. They are a model of how to effectively picture a procedure so the reader will understand what it is you are telling them.<br /><br />Looking at the Table of Contents for this book reveals a really unusual collection of subjects. While there are recipes aplenty, the real focus is on general techniques and how to put them to best use. Several chapters really put a lie to the `home cooking' versus `gourmet cooking' difference, if one equates `gourmet' cooking with the kind of cooking done at Caf&eacute; Boulud Mario Batali's Babbo. These chapters show you how to improvise things such as soups, salads, dried beans, boning and butchering, and stuffing. My experience is that most home cooking is done with one eye on the open book, magazine, newspaper, or internet download with the recipe for your dish. Professional cooking, on the other hand, is often done by what's available that day (See Tom Colicchio's `How to Think Like a Chef').<br /><br />This book is a great read and a great culinary education, even if you never make any recipes from it.

Gives insight into the masculine and feminine journeys. Perhaps the biggest shocker is in the Spiderman II movie, he goes through the classic female journey! <br /> <br />This book has it all. Eight Greek Gods and another eight Goddesses, both their positive and negative sides. Then the side kicks, four types of friends, six types of rivals, and three symbols, all of which can be positive or negative and even perhaps stealthly negative if openly positive. Then a complete analysis of the masculine and feminine journeys. <br /> <br />Some examples from Seinfield: <br />Jerry is \\"The King\\" positive trait of Zeus. <br />Kramer is \\"The Fool\\" positive trait of Hermes. Also \\"The Jester\\" a friendly rivel. <br />Newman is \\"The Nemesis.\\" <br />George is \\"The Lost Soul.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />The strength of this work is quite simple. It works. Greek mythology is based solidly upon good old human nature. If you step back and look at the Greek Gods of Mythology, they are all quite human, getting into human trouble with human failings. <br /> <br />This book will not hinder or limit you, it will free you. It provides outlines, very sketchy and variable. You can devote one sentance or 100 pages to a particular step of the journey, it's up to you and your story. Basing your charactors loosely on one of these Mythic Gods will bring a vague sense of reality and recognition to your charators, you just cannot pass up this book. <br /> <br />By the way, in the book I'm working on my heroine is a Gorgon, the negative aspect of the Goddess Artemis. By the end of her journey she will be the positive aspect, an Amazon. She will go through the masculine journey! Read up to see what this means.	2005-10-10

Parker's \\"Spenser\\" series for the last 15 years or so has witnessed a slow decline in quality of the novels. Stale, predictable plots, recycled narrative riffs, and forced attempts to bring supporting players into the story have become the norm rather than the exception. Whenever an increasingly rare \\"good\\" Spenser novel appears, it generally features Boston as its main backdrop and Hawk, Vinnie, Tony Marcus and other hoodlums from Spenser's past as players in a generally seamy story involving a new gang of lowlifes to be subdued. More often than not, these novels, which almost restore your faith in Parker, are followed by the \\"bad\\" follow-up, which generally take place in the suburbs and feature sleazy, screwed up, white middle class suburbanites in either some prep school, college, horsey farm, or other middle class bastion.  <br /> <br />\\"School Days\\" is no exception. Following last year's better-than-average \\"Cold Service,\\" which was really Hawk's story, with Spenser as the supporting character, this year's offering is 100% Spenser, and without a doubt the most tired \\"Spenser\\" novel in years. There's no Hawk, Susan only appears as a cameo, and Parker's main companion is his dog, Pearl. The action is yet another variation of the \\"rich old woman pays Spenser to find something\\" out, this time involving a Columbine-esque massacre at a well-heeled suburban town. It's the usual \\"things are not what they seem\\" peel-the-onion affair, but it's so shallow and the outcome to predictable that it's completely forgettable. Perhaps Parker is too busy cranking out non-Spenser books, or perhaps the pressure of cranking out these things every year is finally taking taking its toll. Like Tony Hillerman, his fellow mystery novelist in full decline mode, Parker is cashing his check a little too fast, without putting in the hours.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Her humor, perseverance, and honesty helped me endure many a day at my desk.  So it was with great anticipation that I purchased her book Julie & Julia, hoping to find that familiar, sustaining voice within.  I am happy to report that I did. <br /> <br />As a reader coming from the blog to the book, it took me a chapter or two to feel the  connection I had with the blog.  Blogs are such an intimate entre into the writer's head, whereas the necessarily more formal structure of a book eases the reader into relationship with the author.  But by chapter three we were \\"cookin' with gas.\\"   <br /> <br />This book doesn't stand out for me as a cooking memoir as much as it represents the introduction of an important new voice on the cultural landscape.  Powell highlights the countercultural joys of marriage and monogamy for 20 and 30 somethings-a topic definitely not on the radar screen in our chick-lit, Sex-in-the-City climate, where those who marry young are only pitied. But the comforts of marriage are real, and Powell strikes an newly intimate, almost offhand note when revealing the simple pleasures and inevitable grievances of married life.   <br /> <br />She also captures a view of how the events of 9/11 embedded themselves in our national consciousness over time.  The chapter where she describes working in the family visiting room on the anniversary of 9/11 was stark and true, and gave me insight that all the hundreds of news articles and opinion and TV images I've seen relating to that tragedy didn't.    <br /> <br />And giving her brother the pseudonym \\"Heathcliff\\" throughout the book?  Inspired!  I laughed every time I read his name. <br /> <br />Like Anne Lamott, Powell is an incredibly accessible writer.  By revealing her foibles and triumphs in her conversational and intimate way, the reader can't help feeling like a memberof her team, one of her band of  \\"bleaders,\\" cheering her on to the project's end. <br /> <br />I can't wait to read the next offering from this exciting young author.

I constantly hear people who have NEVER read it say things like, \\"It's not good to cut out all carbs.\\" or my personal favorite: \\"You have to eat whole grains to get enough fiber.\\"  Honestly, sometimes I really don't think that people realize that there is more fiber and nutrition in berries and spinach and way more of the omegas you need in meat and fish than there are in whole grains.  If you think about it, what do they feed farm animals to fatten them up for slaughter?  Answer: These animals are usually vegetarians that eat mostly corn, starches and grains.  Additionally, the other diets touting \\"right kinds of carbs\\" are just publishing the Atkins' maintenance phase and relabeling it.  Most diets that are considered \\"reasonable\\" and \\"balanced\\" encourage you to give up nutritional powerhouse foods due to high fat content, such as olives and avocados.  Considering that a serving of each of these foods could help more than they possibly hurt, how does that make any sense?   <br /> <br />Atkins really pioneered the recent changes we've seen on the diet end of the medical industry.  I also think it is interesting that the bankruptcy of the Atkins empire is considered the smoke signal that the low carb craze is over.  It really is just a signal that low carb processed foods are generally inferior in flavor and that eating naturally tastes better - which was the whole point to begin with.  In a way, it explains why most low carb manufacturers are sticking with the meal replacement shakes - sometimes we need something filling, fast, simple and chocolatey. <br /> <br />Once you change your eating habits to eating your favorite unprocessed meats, veggies and berries for 30 days and then change back to how you used to eat for a week or two, you will notice the difference in how you feel.  I found that fillers like bread on a sandwich or with a salad really replaced the nutrients I really would have been putting in my body by eating a few more vegetables or a few extra ounces of meat.  Thus, my old way of eating was not satisfying anymore.   <br /> <br />I know some people experience nausea or fatigue the first week or two and these are classic signs of withdrawal from any substance you've been depending on.  Granted, some don't react well with the higher animal fat content they are allowed to now eat, so therefore, they should probably stick with chicken and fish or add a couple more salads or cooked green vegetables (all carb limits aside, who EVER got fat off of unlimited green salads and non starchy vegetables?).	2005-10-10

What it accuses as narcissistic to those that rebel can be the very lens to see those that obey. And so the Eastern thoughts of inward relative diversity are framed under fundamental unity which does not tolerate autonomy.    According to Adi Da, anyone who is not in satsang with him is practicing Narcissism. That is the higher paradigm here. Adi Da is a divine incarnation of the god Da and only where all conceptual inquires, all seeking, all efforts at spiritual development are meaningless unless they are in satsang with \\"me\\" and thus the only and absolute alternative is by living within the communal relationship with Adi Da and his devotees. And so this really is a Cult with the control that does not tolerate the two cardinal rules, to first, think for oneself and second, to question authority. And almost all cults have good points to offer within their paradigms.    And the paradox here is that the trees inside this controlling and limited forest bring out some profound points. Some of these include the idea of community relationship with Adi Da in simply a moving, playful, spontaneous relationship in the present moment as opposed to simply intellectual analysis of spiritual growth and that the idea of seeking is part of the problem itself. Here it is letting go of the seeking, which is based on suffering from a moving thought created mind, into now a nonconceptual movement within ordinary life, not some spectacular satori or nirvana but the ordinary life here and now perceived in its now enlightened awareness and paradoxically in this world of the mundane. Also the idea that we are sleeping in a dream and waking up is not seeking for solutions, as solutions are merely those inside the dream, where as to wake up is simply an awareness, again, only in satsang with \\"me.\\"     And while there are theseand many other rather insightful and profound points, they are to the objective reader, contaminated with the control of satsang with what appears to be only a man, a man who both claims to be a god-man and is worshipped as one by many followers who have separated themselves from those not part of the satsang community with Adi Da. Now I am only an ignorant human and Adi Da may just be the incarnate of a divinity, so one can not judge or know any more as an ignorant human being reading this book, for it does not put one in Satsang with Adi Da, as this comes only with personal and direct communication.     In this paradigm there is negative views on solitude and nature mysticism, labeling all as narcissism, while Adi Da is claiming both divinity and absolute devotion for anyone to obtain the \\"truth,\\" only in satsang with \\"me.\\" And so, to look at the trees, there are many moist and ripe, insightful in meanings, and then there is the forest, the forest which unites without individuality to a controlled environment, a life that lacks autonomy and condemns unity from diversity.	2005-10-10

Professor Smith's Natural Philosophy lectures completed in 1780 provide the peopling of America migration schemes and Smith's Greek Classics lectures on Homer provide the Helen of Troy motiff used to frame the story. Though it is not recorded whether he revisited the peopling of America theme after 1780, he did develop the Dartmouth Arminian Theology lectures between 1787 and 1809 that parallel the Book of Mormon and early Mormon Doctrine quite closely.  <br /> <br />These theology lectures were not directly available to Solomon Spaulding who graduated in 1785 and only the Old Testament lectures were directly availble to Ethan Smith who graduated in 1790 and later lectures were available indirectly through Ethan's son Lyndon who attended Dartmouth from 1813-17. Since Solomon Spaulding completed Manuscript Found in 1812 and died in 1816, his nephews James Spaulding who attended the Dartmouth Medical School from 1811 to 1813 and Levi Spaulding who attended Dartmouth College from 1811 to 1815 did not have an opportunity to influence Manuscript Found but were available to play the same type of role in bringing awareness of Manuscript Found to the Dartmouth campus that Lyndon Smith played in bringing Ethan Smith's early theology books started in 1811 to Dartmouth when he arrived in 1813.  <br /> <br />Joseph Smith would have been only indirectly aware of ideas discussed at Dartmouth through his brother Hyrum, who attended Moor's School between 1811 and 1815 with Indians. Elijah Lyman a Smith in-law, however, maintained continuous contact with Dartmouth from his nearby Brookfield, Vermont, pastorate where he trained Dartmouth graduates to go on missions to the Indians, including Alfred Finney who graduated in 1814 and trained with Elijah Lyman for a year before going to spend the rest of his life with the Cherokee where he set up the Dwight Indian School. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

This book, 'Hobbes to Hume', is the third volume of a five-volume series on the history of Western Philosophy by W.T. Jones, professor of philosophy in California. This series is a very strong, thorough introduction to the course of Western Philosophy, beginning at the dawn of the philosophical enterprise with the pre-Socratics in ancient Greece to the modern thinkers such as Wittgenstein and Sartre. It has grown, over the three decades or so of its publication, from one to four then to five volumes. It has remained a popular text, and could serve as the basis of a one-year survey of philosophy for undergraduates or a one-semester survey for graduate students. Even advanced students in philosophy will find this valuable, all major topics and most minor topics in the course of philosophy are covered in these volumes.<br /><br />Jones states that there are two possible ways for a writer to organise a history of philosophy -- either by addressing everyone who ever participated in philosophy (which could become rather cumbersome if one accepts the premise that anyone could be a philosopher), or to address the major topics and currents of thought, drawing in the key figures who address them, but leaving out the lesser thinkers for students to pursue on their own. Jones has chosen the latter tactic, making sure to provide bibliographic information for this task.<br /><br />This volume, 'Hobbes to Hume', starts where the last volume leaves off, as the medieval world is beginning to change in social, cultural, and political terms as well as intellectually. The world of feudalism, over-arching church authority and local absolute monarchies was giving way to feelings of nationalism, shared government, and, perhaps most crucially, an end to absolute dominance of a church that had become problematic in many ways.<br /><br />The Renaissance began in Italy in force, drawing intellectual force from thinkers and artists who espoused a more humanistic outlook on life. Shortly thereafter (historically speaking) the Reformation began, first in Germany and then spreading across various parts of the West. Both the Renaissance and the Reformation attacked the medieval mindset, but from different directions. But perhaps one of the key ideas upon which both agreed was that the individual is largely more important than the institutions to which he or she belonged. This continues to be a tension to this day politically and philosophically, as ethnic, national, communal and religious ties still call for common emphasis.<br /><br />Part of the rapid development of intellectual fields included science -- Leonardo da Vinci, Copernicus, Bacon, Galileo, Kepler and others made great strides in advancing science and technology, and worked in many ways to separate the new discipline from philosophy and theology, which was more of a joint enterprise even at this stage.<br /><br />It was perhaps Descartes and Hobbes who were the first to develop philosophy as something mostly distinct from theology in this period. However, even they (and Spinoza, who came along shortly thereafter) could not escape the theological influences of the community entirely. As philosophical development continued through Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley and Hume, the ideas of epistemology, ethics, politics and metaphysics were becoming firmly established as ideas apart from the dogmatic reign of the church.<br /><br />Each volume ends with a glossary of terms, and a worthwhile index. The glossary warns against short, dictionary-style definitions and answers to broad terms and questions, and thus indicates the pages index-style to the discussion within the text for further context. The one wish I would have would be a comprehesive glossary and index that covers the several volumes; as it is, each volume has only its own referents.<br /><br />This is minor criticism in a generally exceptional series. It is not easy text, but it is not needlessly difficult. The print size on the direct quotes, which are sometimes lengthy, can be a strain at times, but the reading is worthwhile.ect quotes, which are sometimes lengthy, can be a strain at times, but the reading is worthwhile. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

As a person interested in philosophy (particularly moral philosophy), my interest was piqued when I saw this book. I am always up for a good criticism of relativism (whether theoretical or pratical). What I got was a far cry from that. Instead, I got a very tired, rambling and oh-so cliche christian-right harrangue against everything not conservative. If that is what you want, go for this book (though Pat Robertson has written better). If that is not what you want, you have been forewarned.  <br /> <br />The biggest problem I have with this book is that the author frankly misunderstands the 'relativism' he rails against. While he rightly states that relativism is the belief that there is no meta-arbiter to decide which beliefs are superior to others, this is not what he laments. He does not lament that society has been rendered incapable of choosing values (because of relativism), but rather that society HAS chosen values, but that they are ONES THE AUTHOR DISAGREES WITH. When he states, as he tirelessly does, that \\"society has no values/standards anymore,\\" he does not mean literally this. Rather, he means only to say, \\"Society has values that I think have moved in the wrong direction.\\" If this is what Mr. Knight means, he should have been honest. Instead of substitling the book, \\"the rise of relativism and the corruption of popular culture,\\" it may have better read, \\"the rise of secularism, leftism and other things I can't stand and the corruption of popular culture.\\" <br /> <br />The next problem is that from a philosophical standpoint, Mr. Knight only asserts that conservative Christian beliefs are better than leftist/secular beliefs but offers precious little argument as to why this is so. The only argument he uses is a (?!) utilitarian one. This, of course, only after he argues against utilitarian thinking! See the humor?  <br /> <br />The third problem I have is that while the book is organized into chapters, the author wanders around so much from sub-rant tosub-rant, that it might as well not be. Most every chapter, whether on secularism, declining standards in TV, or declining standards in architecture (a most unfortunate chapter, by the way), finds our author admonishing against the 'homosexual agenda.'(I am left to assume that the 'heterosexual agenda' is the better agenda, but have no idea why, as Mr. Knight doesn't argue for it.) <br /> <br />I could write more, but I think my point has already been made. The book is sloppy; the book is cliche; the book is poorly thought out and written. Quite simply, it is not worth the time or effort.	2005-10-10

US	40051756	R3DMIS5IH8EHBV	0385477139	309626697	Cracking the Show	Books	3	7	7	N	N	Ode to the Orioles	I have enjoyed reading other works by Thomas Boswell including \\"Why Time Begins on Opening Day\\", \\"How Life Imitates the World Series\\" and \\"The Heart of the Order\\".  I found Boswell to be one of the very best baseball writers in America.  I guess that's why I was so disappointed in \\"Cracking the Show\\".  In the aforementioned books, Boswell gives a great and impartial perspective of major league baseball.  In \\"Cracking the Show\\", he seem to hit nothing but \\"homers\\".  I realize that Boswell writes from that neck of the woods and it seems logical to write about what you know best.  I will also admit that I had a very sincere respect for the Orioles of the late 70's and early 80's when I lived in Milwaukee.  As the Brewers were rising to their lone American League pennant, it was the Orioles, not the Yankees, we feared (and respected) the most.  Billy Martin was a side show; Earl Weaver was a genius.  However, Weaver retired and things changed (boy did they ever for the Brewers!).  In his previous books, Boswell was forgiven his occassional excesses of the Robinsons or the Earl of Baltimore because he told us about plenty of other players, teams and events.  Indeed, the section that he wrote in this book entitled \\"Five Octobers\\" brings his overall genius to enough light so that it enables the rest of us to see it's still there.  However, for those of us who failed to recognize that Cal Ripken Jr. (or Sr., for that matter) was the Second Coming, this book is a disappointment.  Yes, Ripken is a nice guy and, yes, he was one of the best of his era.  However, the emphasis is on ONE of the best; not THE best.  He's gotten the record, he single-handedly saved Baseball but through that time he was in ONE, count 'em, ONE post season.  Ripken also continued his streak throughout each and every game of the famous 0 for 21 games that the Orioles started the season with in 1988.  Many people, myself included, thought that Ripken should have sat at least one of those games after thestreak got to double digits.  It's called shaking up the team and that's what happened when his own father was fired during the streak.  Obviously the son's \\"streak\\" was more important than the father's job and reputation.  I could go on and on regarding this subject and it usually gets me in trouble.  However, consider the example that Ripken set the record for most consecutive All-Star game selections.  Keep in mind that there was no All-Star game prior to 1933 so some of the very best missed out on this record.  However, does anybody actually believe that Cal Ripken Jr. is the greatest player since 1933?  That is, besides Thomas Boswell.   <br /> <br />Mr. Boswell seems convinced that the rest of us glory in the Oriole's transformation from the worst team in Baseball to almost clinching the division the very next season.  He really talks this up while remaining nonplussed when the Braves and Twins did exactly that a year or so later.  I wish I could find the quote where he bemoans the boredom of watching aging veterans chasing down magic numbers such as 500 home runs, 300 wins, or 3000 hits (not to mention 2130 consecutive games).  His point was, I believe, that the joy in Baseball is not knowing what will happen next rather than keeping tabs on the inevitable.  Still, he does give us some thought-provking essays on Pete Rose and the fall of the commissioner's office. <br /> <br />I guess the point is that we've been spoiled by his previous excellence as a sports reporter with national credentials.

The content of the book deserves all the accolades that other reviewers have heaped upon it, so I won't repeat what has already been said. <br /> <br />Garret Oliver's passion for beer and food is evident from the first paragraph. The prose is at once zealous, lighthearted, and entertaining, and his enthusiasm is infectious. Once opening the book, one can't help but consider what beer to accompany the next meal or snack, to the point of planning menus for the whole week. A delightful  must-read for anyone looking to improve their culinary life; also an invaluable resource to any restauranteur, chef, sommelier, caterer, gourmet food or beer retailer.	2005-10-10

At page 238, I am just under 2/3 finished with \\"Goodnight Nobody\\" but it is extremely slow going. <br /> <br />For most of the book, I've wondered if I somehow mistakenly stumbled into a Janet Evanovich book.  Crime Fighter Kate and her zany friend Janie are evocative of Stephanie Plum and her sidekick Lula.  One of Weiner's strengths has always been her deep affection for women; especially those who don't fit society's current ideal.  But the strength and humor the author's previous central characters have always shown is lacking in \\"Goodnight Nobody.\\"  There is a sense that Kate is dissatisfied with her life, but there is also a sense that she is more annoyed by her husband and children than she loves them.  Perhaps through longing for a more carefree time in her life, as much of the story is told in flashback to Kate's single days, she will eventually come full circle and gain a new perception of her family.  <br /> <br />There always seems to be a token ridiculous character in every Weiner novel (usually a mother in law or stepmother) but in this book there are several.  Possibly the author thought that scenes depicting people singing \\"If You're Happy and You Know it, Clap Your Hands!\\" at a funeral, or Kate's mother accidentally ingesting Ecstacy at a party, would be funny.  Instead the storyline loses credibility. <br /> <br />I am going to finish this book and hope that Jennifer Weiner abandons the funny-mystery genre in her next book.  The plays for laughs in this example are way too coarse and obvious.	2005-10-10

I totally dis-agree with the other reviewers here giving this book five stars. \\"Watch Your Back\\" is a fun book but it does not stand up to classics like Chandler or Jim Thompson.

But his approach was scholarly and well organized in making those conclusions.<br /><br />1. American culture breeds a belief in \\"just\\" wars where we do not fight unless provoked. At times, such as in Vietnam where the<br /><br />provocation was questionable, the American people and the citizen<br /><br />soldiers found it difficult to fully support the fight.<br /><br />2. In many of America's low-intensity conflicts (Seminole wars, the Phillipine uprising, the Punitive expedition into Mexico, Vietnam),other political concerns took center stage. This has been one factorin the tendency of US forces to not learn from those experiences - seeing them as side-wars that were not \\"real\\" wars in the conventionally-focused organization of the US military.<br /><br />3. The US military (primarily the author focuses on the Army) has a culture fed by the American culture of Euro-centrist thinking that fails to take into account the rest of the world with much<br /><br />significance. This feeds the tendency toward conventional warfare<br /><br />thinking in political leadership as well as military  organization. The conventional mindset is further strengthened by a growing dependence on technology in waging wars since technology most readily supports conventional conflict but is often less effective in counter-insurgency.<br /><br />Sarkesian organized this book into 3 or 4 views of the subject:<br /><br />1. State of the Nation (the political and cultural background of the US military)<br /><br />2. Military Posture (the military organization at the time of the<br /><br />conflict and how it is postured whether peacetime or wartime footing at the hostilities begin)<br /><br />3. Nature of the Conflict (the political-military effectiveness of the enemy and how it is perceived by our military and political leadership)<br /><br />He appears to have followed that same organization in a subsequent book, _Unconventional Conflicts in a New Security Era_.nt book, _Unconventional Conflicts in a New Security Era_.	2005-10-10

In A PEOPLE'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, Howard Zinn is marginally successful in the former and not at all in the latter.  Zinn's massive tome on American history gives an ideologically distorted view with all events, people, and trends seen through the lens of an admitted Marxist who simply cannot grant that even one facet from his book occurred without somehow being tainted by the capitalistic cabal of Euro-Centered white culture.  According to Zinn, from the very inception of American history when Columbus waded ashore in Hispanola, the destruction of native American culture began.  Zinn is probably correct when he notes that Columbus and those who followed him were not at all interested in preserving the identity and culture of the native inhabitants.  Where Zinn goes astray is his evident Marxist bias against capitalism in general and his hatred of all things traditionally American.  The United States as a political entity did not even come into existence until nearly three hundred years after Columbus.  The animus that Zinn feels for present day America he projects onto the English, Dutch, French, and Spanish who were in fact guilty of many of the genocidal activities that he ascribes solely to post-Washington America.  <br /> <br />As Zinn traces the growth of the United States, he lumps together an unwieldy mass of social, economic, military, and political events into a lumpy stew that has only one thing in common: that this growth could never have occurred without the conscious exploitation by a white ruling class of aristocratic plutocrats whose only purpose was to foreshadow the inevitable class struggle as set forth by Marx.  By the time that the reader has plowed through a few hundred pages of prose that seems to present a theory of class exploitation over other causes that might explain the hows and whys of the development of a country that certainly had some truth to the charges leveled by Zinn, the reader has grown weary of being spoon fed a stultifying and steady diet of a now defunct Marxist ideology that still permeates much thinking from the Left.  The final verdict on Zinn is that his readers ought to know that his entire life has been spent trying to explain that the United States is the worst most evil country the world has ever known. Apparently, Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, and Kim Jong Ill's North Korea were not even close.	2005-10-10

She is independently wealthy, has two well-adjusted adult children and lives in a ritzy high-rise downtown Washington D.C. apartment worthy of Architectural Digest. Although she spends her days experimenting with new recipes, napping, sipping martinis, cleaning her extremely tidy apartment and wafting about in her favorite white gown while thinking about sex, she tells herself and her family that she's not bored, that her life is absolutely perfect, just as it is. <br /> <br />Then one day she hears a voice in her head, a voice that tells her that a murder will be committed in her apartment building within 30 days. The voice also says that she has the power to prevent this murder.  <br /> <br />Anne confesses this unusual event to Mary, a stout, ebullient African-American woman who works in the building as a cleaning woman. She doesn't clean Anne's apartment since Anne loves to clean, (a passion that I cannot begin to understand) but her position does give her access to and knowledge of many of the residents. Anne and Mary each decide that one of the top candidates for murderer of the month is a suave, handsome thirty-ish Russian gentleman. Mary's investigative techniques involve eavesdropping and observation; Anne follows her overactive libido and decides to sleep with him.  <br /> <br />I vicariously enjoyed the many martinis imbibed throughout the novel, as this is my Friday end-of-workweek drink of choice. But my absolute favorite part was the secret passage, a device rarely used in an adult book. It took me back to my pre-teen years when I passionately read dozens of \\"girl running away from castle\\" books. <br /> <br />If you are looking for light entertainment and you aren't wedded to a particular genre preference (I couldn't quite figure out whether this book was a romance with a dash of mystery or a mystery with frivolous flings), pick up a copy of My Very Own Murder. To enrich your overall experience, I suggest you dress in your most comfy \\"I feel good about me\\" outfit and apply a chilled martini on your lips.	2005-10-10

Humiliated and hungry, Jana opens the door of Midnight Dreams and faints.  Luckily for her, Tyler Maxwell and his sister Olivia were there to help her.  Fearing a lawsuit, they took her to the hospital where she was treated by Dr. Julian Cortez.  For Tyler, Jana was a mystery waiting to be solved.  For, Olivia, Jana was a woman in need and she was going to do everything she could to help, including taking her home and hiring her to work in her shop.  For Jana, Olivia proved to be something she had never expected to have,  a true friend and Tyler was a man who wanted her for more than just her body.  The relationship between Jana and the Maxwell siblings is what makes up Francis' Ray newest novel Any Rich Man Will Do.<br /><br />While touted as women's fiction, for this reader this book is another example of why Francis Ray is one of my favorite romance writers. The conflict and resolution were just enough to keep me eagerly turning the pages.  Ms Ray usually includes social issues and during your reading and fantasizing, a lesson is being woven throughout the story.

What George Fox was on about is made clear in this carefully selected and grouped collection of extracts from Fox's writings. Ambler says in his introduction that the writings almost grouped themselves, and they are easy to follow because of the grouping. However the anthology with its reader-friendly introduction, modern English parallel text and concluding essay is clearly the result of much work. <br /> <br />Ambler's selection ahows that George Fox was on about the spiritual process by which individuals can discover the Truth for themselves; the truth about themselves and how to live. This book is valuable both for the curious about Quakers, and those who like myself have come to join the Religious Society of Friends with only a second-hand knowledge of what the founder of Quakers was teaching.	2005-10-10

This is not so much a biography or literary criticism as it is a reading companion. A well written examination of Camus' work for the casual philosopher who wants to get the most out of their literary experiences with Camus. Philip Thody was Assistant Lecturer of French at Queen's University of Belfast at the time of publication (1959).<br /><br />The chapters are 1) The Expression of The Absurd 2)Resistance and Revolt 3) The Plague 4) Two Plays 5)True Rebellion and False Rebels 6) The Creative Revival and 7)Achievement and Limitations.<br /><br />It is paperback bound.<br /><br />Philip Thody dicusses pertiant existensial topics and uses the philosophical allegroies found in most of Camu's works with excellent focus on 'The Plague'. The language is concise and clear. I found both disagreement and agreement with many points and observations made. The Reference section is robust and helful for further study. A solid find in any used book store. Recommended for any entry level, moderate or self studied student of the French Existensialists. It may also be a useful for anyone who simply doesn't 'get' what all the fuss is about for Camus.	2005-10-10

An American soldier, Sgt. Michael Foster was a public health inspector for the Military base in Vicenza, but early this particular morning he had been found dead floating in a Venetian Canal.    Commisario Brunetti investigates, but with a delicate touch. Brunetti boss Vice-Questore Patta is quick to point out that an American who has been killed in Venice would not look good for the tourist trade, this matter was to be cleared up and quickly. Patta was happy to settle for robbery as all evidence point's in this direction, but Brunetti was more inclined to think Murder.    Patta is the least of Brunetti problems, his superior he could manipulate but as for the American Military base, they had their own ideas about such an investigation and of course they were more than happy to cooperate but at times were just a little bit to helpful. Someone was going to great pains to cover tracks. Brunetti was willing to play their games as long as it got him to the real motive.    This is my third book by Donna Leon in the Brunetti series, once again wonderful, the book flows really well, with a sense of humour in tact. For me again the fictional characters really brings it to life.    Already from reading Death at La Fenice, I first meet the Sicilian Vice-Questore Giuseppe Patta, Brunetti's superior his a great character. Patta's main concern is with image, first his own and eventually what looks good for the Venice police. A man who turns in for work around 10am, paperwork looking good on his desk but does he read it. You could almost hear the words cue, action, before anyone enters his office, he gives his all in his performance.    Brunetti the man of logic with his loving wife and family. His wife's well connected parents always on hand to help them out. There's nothing like getting on with the in-laws, Brunetti finds them a real source of information.     This novel shows to us the corruption of power. a wonderful read.	2005-10-10

Hive is a mixed bag. I've only read one other thing by Curran and that was in Warfear a short story called the Chattering of Tiny Teeth. That was a great story and i had high hope for this one. Some which were met and others that weren't. <br /> <br />Hive centers around a artic expedition where there are two sets of people the Scientists and the Engineers. The story starts off with the discovery of \\"mummies\\" by a drilling team. We come to learn that these mummies are something that has never been seen before and believed to be alien in nature. Not too long after there discovery weird things start to happen to people. Odd dreams plague the camp and insanity besets a certain few as well.I don't want to give too much away here.Just suffice to say that not all the mummies are quite dead and they have some plans for us. <br /> <br />Now my main complaint regarding this novel is that it is NOT a sequel to At the Mountains of Madness. For those of you who have read that story you will remember that the story centered around a Shoggoth uprising against their alien masters. This story ahs nothing whatsoever to do with those events other than to mention the Pabodie expedition and distort it to its own use. Hive is well written but it lacks the cosmic dread that Lovecraft and also Kiernan are so good at. Everything is explained in too much detail which is not good. Another gripe of mine is that you really don't feel very much for the characters they are more like cardboard cut outs than 3 dimensional people who you care for.  <br /> <br />Overall i did enjoy Hive, it was well paced and suspenseful. While not a great novel it is enjoyable if you take it for what it is. Also a side note that cover is spectacular its ashame that it really has nothing to do with the story.	2005-10-10

There are 2 kinds of books: those that provide you with knowledge, and those that provide you with a method of understanding. Most of books belong to the first category; but they&#8217;re useless if you don&#8217;t know how to understand them. Books of the second type are rare and priceless: once you&#8217;ve read one of them different perspectives, closed before, open before you. Few of us have seriously thought what hides behind the common concepts of our time: truth, causality, science, knowledge, etc. We use these words mechanically, without thinking, without understanding that these notions are historical, not eternal.<br /><br />Books like that of Paul Veyne make a &#8220;revision&#8221; of foundations of our thinking, providing us with another scheme of thinking, radically different from the common-sense one. And, as P.Veyne says, &#8220;two schemes are better than one&#8221;.<br /><br />Behind the seemingly narrow and specialised title &#8220;Did Greeks believe in their myths?&#8221; really hides a philosophical essay on the nature of our world-view. What is truth, and is it possible that there&#8217;re many &#8220;truths&#8221;, not just one? Did the concept of truth in modern sense exist in ancient times? When did modern history begin and what&#8217;re its methods? What is myth, and isn&#8217;t our science (Einstein, Freud, etc.) also based on its own myth? What is the sociology of truth, and its social distribution? What is faith, and its relation to power? How should we read ancient cosmogonies? Is myth a way of thinking, or a kind of knowledge, or something else? When did the notion of &#8220;historical time&#8221; appear, and are other concepts of time possible?<br /><br />All these questions are brilliantly addressed in this little book, and are masterfully answered. Buy this book and read it attentively: it&#8217;s worth your time!:)	2005-10-10

The book has a series of <br />articles from prominent researchers on Schizophrenia <br />and creativity. Some interesting observations were <br />made such as James Ogilvie's comparison of the <br />Schizophrenic's experience to that of a philosopher  <br />in that both are preoccupied with foundational questions <br />including creativity. I also found Louis Sass's <br />article and critique of Kay Redfield Jamison's book <br />\\"Touched with Fire\\" to be very interesting in pointing <br />out areas where she may have overlooked potential for <br />more schizophrenia spectrum styles of creativity.  <br />Particularly he considers more modernist and <br />revolutionary styles of creativity that Schizophrenia <br />spectrum individuals might have stronger affinities <br />with as opposed to Bipolar spectrum individuals.  <br />All in all a great book and it helped me understand my <br />experience of being a 'mad creator' better and gives hope  <br />in efforts of recovery, especially since I am a very <br />young man and a music technology major.  Highly reccomended for <br />Schizophrenia spectrum individuals, loved ones, and <br />just about anyone else who is interested in the  <br />fascinating relation between creativity and madness.	2005-10-10

In 3 weeks I read Stiglitz, Friedman and Klein as a sample of pro-'s and cons of the economic globalization scene. I think Klein's offered the sharpest and most incisive analysis of the phenomena of the 3. <br />The first part of the book, the analytical part in which corporate strategies of the 80's and 90's are \\"exposed\\" is of an outstanding quality and certainly not outdated 5 years after first publication. The second part, the description of the activism and anti-globalisation forces is less convincing. Klein's (and a lot of other people's) bad luck has been that shortly after the publication the War on Terror has buldozered all criticism of corporate activities into the \\"against us\\" corner. As a result, a lot more sweatshop workers around the world have suffered as a result of Al Quada than New Yorkers have.	2005-10-10

Noah Braddock isn't your typical angst-ridden, liquorswilling, grizzled PI. In fact, he's fairly young--just shy of thirty--and overall, baby, life is good. His job as a PI gives him plenty of time to surf and makes him enough money to keep his beachfront apartment and a six-pack of beer in the fridge.  <br /> <br />His life gets a lot more complicated however when Marilyn Crier, the mother of his high school girlfriend Kate, calls him out of the blue and tells him that Kate is missing--and she wants Noah to find her.  <br /> <br />Noah's more than a touch surprised that Marilyn wants to hire him--after all, when he was in high school, she'd made it clear that her daughter should be dating someone more suitable, not a surfer from the wrong side of the tracks. Althrough he's reluctant to get involved, he can't say no, not when Kate might be in danger. The more he investigates her disapperance, though, the more he realizes that Kate wasn't the person he remembered--abd that to learn the truth, he must first confront the dark corners of his own past.  <br /> <br />With Killer Swell, Jeff Shelby carves out a place for himself next to the likes of Randy Wayne White, T. Jefferson Parker, and Carl Hiaasen, Filled with crackling prose, rich atmosphere, and an amazing main character, Killer Swell is a truly stunning debut from an exceptional new author.	2005-10-10

For anyone with a serious interest in the  Restoration period, this book becomes an exercise in \\"count the inaccuracies\\" (one of the best: the caption identifying the entire sprawling complex of Windsor Castle as Nell's Burford House) The tangled families and intrigues of the Court are a challenge, true, but these are a mess.  Clearly the author was far more interested in identifying himself as a descendent of Nell and Charles II than in bothering to get his facts right -- but perhaps in England, it's still better to be a many-generations-removed-royal-by-blow than a thoughtful scholar and historian.   <br />Nell, I'm sorry.

I have loved Hornby for years now, ever since \\"High Fidelity\\" reinvigorated my love for modern fiction. His newest work, \\"A Long Way Down\\", doesn't disappoint and is a good, quick read. While the subject matter of the book, suicide in the face of the banality of modern life, is reather heavy-- the tone is light and humourous. The book isnt quite as engaging or hilarious as Hornby's first two works (About a Boy and High Fidelity), but it is certainly worth your time. <br /> <br />The author tells the story through four different narrorators, all of whom went to the top of a building on New Years Eve, planning to off themselves. While having little in common, the four eventually become a support group for each other, and they all learn alot about themselves and life through the stories and actions of the others. <br /> <br />My main problem with the story is in that I didnt really care for two of the four characters. I don't mean that Hornby didnt make them all likeable, because he did, I just mean that a couple of them were rather boring and inconsistant. <br /> <br />The best character is without a doubt Martin, who will remind you of the lead in Hornby's first two books. He wants to die because he was a British celebrity who has been shamed and lost everything because of a sex scandal. The emotions that Martin feels are real and powerful, and you can tell that Hornby put alot of himself into this character. A lot of the books most powerful ideas center around Maureen, the single mother with the disabled child who occupies her entire life. It is impossible, altho not necessarily all that believable, to hear about her sad and lonely life and how she has been able to survive this long. <br /> <br />The other two characters, I didnt like as much. JJ, who is an American musician, is a complete bore. Maybe he is meant as the character who is guys like me are supposed to identify the most with, but nothing that he says or does is especially interesting. Generally, when Iwas reading the parts of the story told by him, I was just waiting to get to the next section. The fouresome is completed by Jess, who is a drama queen in the highest fashion, and is completely out of control. I thought that she was a little bit overdone at times, altho in the latter part of the book she begins to behave a little bit more like an actual human being. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the book, and it did get me thinking and talking about some issues. There really isnt much action in the story, but action is not Hornby's specialty. It is the magic of his dialogue that keeps this book interesting, and this is where Hornby is a genuis.	2005-10-10

Eric Alterman's thesis rests on three parts smoke, four parts mirrors, and one-half part fact. Here's how Eric tries to make his case using intellectual and empirical sleights-of-hand:<br /><br />1. Change definitions.<br /><br /> A. Define liberalism down. If you were to argue that there is no crime problem, one technique would be to minimize the number of criminals, would it not?  Similarly, if you're setting out to convince Americans that there is no mainstream liberal media, you would minimize the number of liberals. That means people and institutions that ordinary people think of as left-wing, or liberal, are going to be labeled centrist or even right-wing. So, in Eric's world, the Democratic Leadership Counsel, Joe Klein and the New Republic are \\"neo-conservative\\" (p 10), David Broder is conservative (p 57) and Howard Stern and Don Imus are \\"movement conservatives\\" at the \\"extreme far-right end of the political spectrum\\" (p 70) (meanwhile, the anti-Bush hatemonger Paul Krugman is just an \\"economist/pundit\\" (p 13)).<br /><br /> B. Define liberalism as not really liberal. Eric notes that American liberals are to the right of European liberals (pp 17-18); therefore, his logic seems to be, even our liberal media isn't really that liberal. Wow. What brilliant reasoning. When Eric writes a book on international comparative politics and the media I'm sure that information will come in handy. Until then, it seems like a bit of a non sequitur in a book about the American media.<br /><br />2. Confuse tokenism with policy.<br /><br /> A. Eric argues that publications and other media like the New Yorker, New York Times, Vanity Fair and the Washington Post aren't liberal because they employ some conservative writers and correspondents (pp 10-11). To rebut what can only fairly be termed a really stupid argument, I need only ask whether Eleanor Clift's and Wesley Clark's presence on the Fox News Channel means Fox isn't conservative.<br /><br /> B. Eric states that the right wing enjoys a \\"vast advantage\\" in the punditry business (p 28) and that most pundits are \\"strong conservatives\\" (p 45). He cites George Will in particular, along with a couple of others. Now, let's see. Tim Russert worked for Pat Moynihan; Chris Matthews worked for Tip O'Neill, Bill Moyers worked for LBJ and George Stephanopoulos worked for Clinton. Wolf Blitzer's on the left; Larry King's on the left; Washington Week is populated entirely with lefties, Bob Schieffer's a lefty and Charlie Rose is a hard lefty. And on the right? O'Reilly and Scarborough, that's it. All the other punditry shows are half-and-half.<br /><br />3. Hide the lack of hard data.<br /><br /> A. Provide no hard data yourself. Eric complains of Bernard Goldberg's book Bias: \\"During the course of 220 pages of complaining, Goldberg never bothers to systematically prove the existence of liberal bias in the news...\\" (p 6).  In 267 pages of Eric's book, he does no better for his side.<br /><br /> Relatedly, in a monumental case of chutzpah, Eric complains about the non-scientific nature of the famous 1992 Media Studies Center survey (89% of journalists voted for Clinton) because it had only 139 respondents for 323 questionnaires mailed (pp 16, 20), but then turns around and cites in support of his counter-thesis a David Croteau survey which had 141 people responding to 444 questionnaires mailed (Ch. 2 fn 17; pp 21, 273; see the survey itself on the FAIR website). A case of journalistic and intellectual sloppiness -- or a case of \\"facts for me but not for thee\\"?  I report, you decide.<br /><br /> B. Rely on anecdotes and scattered observations. These actually comprise the bulk of the book, much of which is mere complaining, score settling and name calling. See, for example, the treatment of Ann Coulter on pp 3-5, Bernie Goldberg on pp 5-9, Bill O'Reilly on pp 35-38, Chris Matthews on pp 38-40, David Broder on pp 46-52, 57, Michael Kelly on pp 54-55 and Howard Kurtz on pp 61-69. And of couse we get theobligatory Richard Scaife and Rupert Murdoch Axis of Evil (pp 234-242, 245-256).<br /><br /> C. Gloss over unfounded assumptions. On his way to another bogus conclusion, Eric does make a salient point: it's hard for journalists to criticize their parent companies and advertisers (pp 22-27). True, but not necessarily relevant. Eric seems to be laboring under the false assumption that legal entities, insofar as they can be deemed to lean politically one way or the other, are right-wing. Not true at all. Businesses are compositions of people of all stripes on all levels, some of whom could be considered \\"conservative\\" but many others, such as the leaders of Berkshire Hathaway, Microsoft etc. are liberal. Therefore, even if there is an institutional bias against attacking companies qua companies, it operates equally between \\"left-wing\\" and \\"right-wing\\" companies.<br /><br />4. Admit the truth, then bury it. \\"I concur that the overall flavor of the elite media reporting favors gun control, campaign finance reform, gay rights and the environmental movement, but I do not find this bias as overwhelming as some conservative do...\\" (pp 109-110).<br /><br />Besides the thematic errors and contradictions described above, there is plenty of other bogus information, half-truths, distortions etc. that one has come to expect from the Left. Here are a few:<br /><br />* The Columbia Journalism Review is not one of \\"a few key journalistic watchdog institutions\\" (p xiii). Who is chairman of the CJR?  Why, that would be the same person who publishes Eric's articles at The Nation, Victor Navasky.  I think the terms \\"left-wing bias\\" for CJR and \\"hypocritically incestuous\\" for Alterman's stroking the CJR at least begin to cover *that* relationship.<br /><br />* The Bush Administration did not choose \\"unilaterally, and without any prior consultation, to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol\\" (p 18). Eric seems to think his target audience is the other side of the bell curve.  For Eric's target audience, let me explain. The Kyoto Protocol was *signed* by President Clinton a little over four months before the last day permitted under its terms.  Under the U.S. system of government, signature on a treaty is only one step in a two-step process.  The other is confirmation by two-thirds of the Senate (U.S. Const. Art II., Sec. 2, cl. 2).  In 1997, S.Res. 98, a stalking horse test vote, shot down the Protocol 95-0.  So: (1) \\"consultation\\" was made under the Clinton Administration by the Senate's test vote and (2) we were never under the Protocol in the first place!  What a totally moronic thing for Eric to say.  Does he really think that he's fooling anyone?<br /><br />* Liberalism did not find its \\"contemporary intellectual definition\\" with John Rawls' \\"veil of ignorance\\" thesis (p 19).  Rawls wrote \\"A Theory of Justice\\" in 1971.  Liberalism as an identifiable political theory had existed for years by then.  Remember Mr. Reagan's floor speech railing against liberalism's contemporary intellectual definition at the 1964 Republican Convention?  If Eric can't even accurately cite his own sacred texts, how can we take him seriously about anything else?<br /><br />* There is not a \\"far-right domination of the nation's airwaves\\" (pp 71-72). If Eric meant domination of the talk radio format, then he should have said so -- or gotten a better editor.<br /><br />* If the reason for the success of the Right in public discourse is \\"superior marketing abilities\\" (p 82), when the Left dominates the creative talent from Madison Avenue to Hollywood, then any honest liberal has to ask if it's the product and not the packaging.<br /><br />* It takes a lot of nerve to complain about the coverage Al Gore got in the 2000 campaign (pp 148-191) then not mention that the MSM called Florida for Gore while polls were still open in the heavily-Republican panhandle.  When the chips were down, the mainstream liberal media delivered its all for its guy, even at the cost of wrecking its ownreputation.<br /><br />* Florida election law was not \\"almost entirely on the side of Gore\\" (p 179) except in the sense that all the Florida Supreme Court Justices were Democrats.  Under then-existing Florida law, candidates had seven days to challenge an election and tabulate a result, which would have been relatively easy to do in the time allotted. Gore only held on for as long as he did because the Florida Supreme Court took that number seven, waved a magic wand, and transformed it into 19, then refused to set statewide standards for a manual recount, leaving it to each recounting county's Democrat operatives to fashion standards that best suited Gore.<br /><br /> The NYT itself, in a Nov. 12, 2001 article, agreed that Bush still would have won even if all undervotes had been counted. Eric contradicts this conclusion, stating that \\"No matter how you counted it, if everyone who legally voted in Florida had had a chance to see their vote counted, Al Gore was our president\\" (p 190). His support for this bold assertion? An article written by -- Eric Alterman! (Ch. 11 fn 75; pp 190, 298).  That reminds me of the line \\"While Lenin read a book on Marx.\\"<br /><br />* To Eric, it's just a \\"common-sense observation\\" to state that a journalist should not have an opinion about the 9-11 attack on the Pentagon. That speaks for itself.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a mishmash of bogus and sloppy reasoning, trashing the competition, scaring up the usual right-wing bogeymen, and whining and preening.  It's fun to see the answer (such as it is) to the question: \\"How could anyone think the media has a conservative bias?\\" but not much more.audience, let me explain.

While Nick Lasseter is nursing a broken heart and worried about losing a very mediocre position at The Waterloo Weekly, Beverly Flintic, a newly elected state assemblywoman, is receiving daily visits from lobbyist Kenneth (Bones) Lasseter and meeting gubernatorial candidate Mark Hardaway in distant motels for a few hours. Neither Nick nor Beverly are especially tuned into local politics, both struggling to stay afloat, minor fish in a bay full of sharks in Waterloo, Texas, a thinly disguised Austin. That the inefficient Hardaway, a man of few subtleties, could reach the office of governor says more about his high-powered friends than any assumed political acumen. Beverly's affair with Mark has compromised her effectiveness in her reapportioned district; she has recently put forth a bill for neighborhood gentrification that has hidden clauses affecting the homeowners' right of imminent domain.<br /><br />Andrea Carter, of The Standard American, meets Nick at a funeral for a public figure, William Stanley Sabert. Apparently Kenneth Lasseter is already known to Andrea, whose deceased father worked with Sabert. Writing an article on the Jim Crow library that is about to be demolished for city renovation, Andrea has done an interview with Sabert; hence her presence at the funeral, the only dark face in the crowd. Nick is attracted to Andrea but is distracted by a scheduled interview with Beverly Flintic, although he has no background information on which to base his questions. That changes when Bones Lasseter gives his nephew a sheaf of papers concerning the bill Flintic has sponsored. Republican Flintic is somewhat concerned about the bill and its furthering of privatization of government agenda, but has been assured that all is in order.<br /><br />Beverly is well-meaning and over-worked, trying to resolve family issues while representing a constituency that demands more from her than the usual sellout. Bit by bit, moving through a gridlocked urban sprawl, Olsson's protagonists awaken to their mutual concerns. Even, Bones, the crusty Democratic lobbyist, can read the writing on the wall: \\"It seems like it's all or nothing. There's no more spirit of conviviality.\\" The nostalgic ramblings of these likeable characters reveal a city of conflicts, compromises and the simple urge to succeed in life; these flawed citizens are just like working people anywhere. On the other hand, the grim reality of a shifting economy doesn't slip Olsson's attention, or how easily the important things slip our attention.<br /><br />Couched in everyday amiability, this novel could be Anywhere, USA, the scene of the privatization of human services, the massive fortunes made by committees who sponsor both litigation and public servants, spreading their greed to special interests.

The title suggests that this would be a fantastic source in learning to properly care for your horse's hooves, and thus, their soundness. Who wouldn't need a book like this? Don't fall for it. This book is largely a preachy rant about \\"natural\\" hoof care. If you're not one of the 15 people who practice \\"natural\\" hoof care and need an explanation, here goes: \\"Natural\\" hoof care is the misguided idea that horses, no matter what breed, discipline, athletic ability, job, age, soundness or geographic location, will be the most sound with NO shoes, as this is their natural state and they have thrived this way until their domestication. This would really make sense if what we did with our horses was \\"natural,\\" but let's be realistic. Jumping, cutting, dressage, driving and polo are not \\"natural\\" equine activities. Neither is stall confinement, turnout in limited space, performing on sand based footing surfaces, and so on. Sure, there are a select number of performance horses who can excel without shoes, but they are exceptions, not the norm, and were probably born with fantastic hoof genes. If you have a backyard pleasure horse or a trail horse, this may work for you. I did give it 3 stars because the information provided is well written, well researched, and accompanied with appropriate diagrams and pictures. I do, however, not agree with the notion that natural hoof care can work for the majority of performance horses. If you're looking for hoof care books, try Shoeing Right, Well-Shod, or if you're really ambitious, Principles of Horseshoeing. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Unlike other commentators, Norton does not diabolicize Strauss, yet nonetheless points to the aspects  of his thought that opened it up to the conservative and neo-conservative embrace. She demonstrates how Strauss's thought (and other conservative thinkers) have been instrumentalized and transformed by the neoconservative revolution and its hegemonic project.	2005-10-10

Most American's either knowingly, after the burial, or unknowlingly have been taken advantage of by the \\"Dismal Trade\\" aka your local friendly neighborhood Undertaker.  This book gave the consumer a voice against this most secrative of undertakings.   <br /> <br />While Mitford does a great job of describing the, for lack of a better term, baloney the Funeral Trade aka Death Care Industry sells us Americans her animosity against cultural norms at time reflects her Left Leaning, British Protestant staidism.  Catholic and ethnic Americans from predominately Catholic countries tend to view the death and burial arrangements of a family member or friend a bit differently.  To describe viewings or wakes as \\"pagan\\" is just a lot of snobbery on the author's part.  As one who grew up in a very ethnic family and city I know that despite how \\"weird\\" these things seem they serve a social function.  And yes, like weddings, some people and families do go over the top.  Hey, it's a free country and you have a right, living or dead, to spend your money any way you damn well please and that includes wasting it on an overpriced funeral.  But, even I have to admit that as I have arranged for the burial of 3 relatives in 5 years I opted for a much simpler affair than which my parents and grandparents would have sprung.  So Ms. Mitford and her minions are getting their way.  She goes on to compare American Funeral Homes to their English counterparts, which from what I have read of English mortuaries in the 20th and 21st centuries I'll opt for the American versions, simply put, when English folks go to their, unregulated, local mortuaries they have been known to comment that many, as the Bible says \\"stinketh.\\"   <br /> <br />All this being said that is no excuse for exhobetent markups, undefined charges, and general rip-offs that make up many American funerals.  The book also does a service by explaining your rights with pre-paid burial plans.  And, how Death Care is being taken over by large, profit driven, corporations.  What pit falls to look out for and how to better save for your own funeral with a \\"Totten Trust.\\"  And, very good information is given on consumer based Memorial Societies. <br /> <br />This book is a handy guide for the Funeral buying public.  It is not the final word though of how we financially deal with our own finality.	2005-10-10

This remarkable addition to the literature is unique for its restraint, refusal to indulge in speculation, and careful focus on what can be documented, and no more. There were really two conspiracies, that of the Warren commision, and the conspiracy they stumbled on half-consciously but refused to pursue. Since their agenda was fixed in advance, making the 'lone nut' interpretation a foregone conclusion, the whole investigation was bogus. Many previous writers have gotten this far and confused this with the indirect, but very strong evidence of the other conspiracy. But as the author notes there is no smoking gun, only the many discrepancies in the evidence, and the transparnt deceptions in the way the initial investigation was carried out. The author's slow but steady pursuit of the basic deception of the Commission is convincing and manages to avoid the traps that have claimed too many previous efforts in this field. Everytime you think this field has reached its limits another book reopens the whole can of worms. Well done.	2005-10-10

I am using this book along with the Preschooler's Busy Book to create Preschool homeschooling program for my 3 year old and almost 1 year old.

In the States, it's fantastic!  With the internet I can get almost everything, but I can't find some \\"everyday\\" items (such as spray paint).  This is only a warning to anyone who might be considering these books and is living in developing nations (I know from experience that developed nations have almost all of the items she recommends readily available).  For instance, flour is a precious commodity here and I won't use it to make fingerpaints or playdough.    That said, I have recommended these books to other expats living here wanting to create their own homeschool programs for their preschoolers.

Mix Cellini moves into a spinster's house where he pursues his two obsessions, mass murder and beauty.  Cellini is one of those socially tone-deaf people who rightly give others the creeps.<br /><br />The story-within-the-story is how this book updates Great Expectations by Charles Dickens.<br /><br />I'm always fascinated by modern novels that use a prior great novel as a model for their story.  In this case, Ruth Rendell has given us Great Expectations in modern England.<br /><br />Miss Havisham is transformed into Miss Gwendolen Chawcer, a spinster living alone in a falling-down-around-her home, while she reads incessantly and pines for the young man of her youth, Dr. Stephen Reeves, who had attended her father during his final illness.<br /><br />Pip becomes Mix Cellini whose great expectations are to marry a gorgeous model, Nerissa Nash, and enjoy the wealthy celebrity life thereafter.  Mix is obsessed by dark visions of a murderer, Reggie Christie, who had lived in the neighborhood, rather than the escaped convict whose life Pip saved.<br /><br />Estella becomes Nerissa Nash, and Miss Chawcer becomes the go-between who helps connect Mix and Nerissa as Miss Havisham did for Pip and Estella . . . although Miss Chawcer is in no way playing a guardian role for Nerissa.<br /><br />Why do I start off with so much about Great Expectations?  If you don't know and love that novel, you probably won't like 13 Steps Down.  Much of this novel's success comes in seeing it in contrast to Great Expectations for the many social commentaries involved and subtle ironies that Ruth Rendell shares for us.<br /><br />So although there's a crime story and a \\"mystery\\" here . . . in a sense there's no mystery.  This is an old-time morality novel that points out that we have little morality left.<br /><br />The beauties in the story come in its many little ironies.  Many mysteries make the murderer into some kind of twisted genius, rather than the social misfit with limited skills that many murderers actually are.  Ms. Rendell doesn't make that error.  In addition, there's more than a little satire here of the mass murderer novel genre in pointing out how hard it is to kill people and not get caught.  Ms. Rendell also takes her satirical pot shots at romantic stories as her characters fall in love with people who have no interest in them and would be totally unsuitable anyway.<br /><br />If you like your humor swift and lethal without leaving much blood behind, 13 Steps Down will thrill you more than any other crime novel in recent years.  If you want your stories to be literal and serious, you'll wonder why anyone liked this book.o some kind of twisted genius, rather than the social misfit with limited skills that many murderers actually are.

Now this is picky of me, but as a Wiccan myself , it grates me that the author calls the male \\" witches' warlocks and does not make clear that Wicca is a legitimate religion, not a kooky new age cult. <br /> <br /> Aside from that, the book is okay, not Anne Rule level, but okay. I do agree with one reviewer here that the subject could have been handled better and with more depth. There is mention of the submissive brother's interest in Buddhism, for example, and the problem of whether Taylor was in fact mentally ill or faking it was not sufficently examined in this book. The only real valuable thing I can see about this book is that it shows how one person can delude and mislead, almost to the point of mental slavery, at least two other people, to the point of commiting murder. Taylor was obviously narcissitic and actually thought his sexual business fantasies could work, even though he overlooked the reality of human choice. The book is missing some \\"depth\\" about the case, which is why I say its okay, not good. It doesn't suck as a true crime book, but I would not keep it as a reference.	2005-10-10

That being said, it is apparent to anyone who has read the novel of why exactly it is a classic. Bradbury is among those authors from the golden age of science fiction writing. The early to mid 20th century saw a surge of scifi writers, the most prominent standing out from among the crowd to bestow upon us today's required readings. No sarcasm there, infact moreso enthusiasm. Huxley, Orwell, and Bradbury (and the even earlier Wells) have all produced standing classics which are used by many facilities to teach. It is truly a wonderful thing. <br />  <br />      Bradbury's book begins with a recount of the passion and the draw to burning. As a foreshadow, thiese paragraphs seek to write about a fireman in a futuristic dystopian society (dystopian in the quality of mental freedom). The society has, over time, allowed provisions to be made that completely cut out freedom of thought. However, the frightening thing deals with how they do this. Instead of just restricting books and other forms of published media, they have distracted the general public by means of electronic trickery. An advanced and much more frightening form of brainwash, the citizens are too caught up with \\"their family\\" (the referred is actually those on the television, whom they've become so ingrained with that they spend most of the day watching) to care about much else. This works for most, but not all, as humannature dictates. There are those behind the scenes, taking care of the dirty work.  <br />  <br />      Enter Guy Montag, a fireman with the local fire department. Unlike modern convention, firemen in this futuristic nightmare are set out to burn the aformentioned media. They carry bottle of kerosene, the adversary to their predecessors, and  threaten to burn anyone who posesses printed literature. However, Montag dissents when he reads a book that he swiped and he begins to slowly support those who he has hunted for the past years. His captain, Beatty, is a fierce man with a sharp wit. He completely understands Montag's position, as he has lived it, however he sides strongly with the belief that books are the root of all evil and that by destroying them, the government is doing the people a favor. He twists the situation of brainwash into sounding almost appeasing.  <br />  <br />       Bradbury wrote the book in an amazing fashion. Taken from the life of \\"he who burns the books\\" (or the character who's job creates the actual problem), the story follows Montag into his general dissent and being hunted by those he previously worked for. Bradbury uses an amalgam of characters to shape our perception of this world, everything from the foundation upon his societal institution was based to the hidden war that is being waged. Without giving away too much information, it is sufficient to say that the conflict is resolves in a satisfying manner. One would suspect that such an occurence would happen during the upstart of such a ruled society, and I was pleased to see it concluded in that manner.	2005-10-10

This book, an indepth account of the worst car crash and loss of life in all of motorsports, was fascinating but could have been much, much easier to read.  I originally thought that I was just tired as I first sat down to read, but it was the same thing the next day as I struggled with the author's difficult writing style. Since I consider Le Mans one of a handfull of great races, I really wanted to learn more about the tragedy and the aftermath. The author certainly did his research and the  details, maps and drawings, calculations and photos all helped to bring this event, fifty years back, into sharp focus. A definite plus. I especially loved his explanation of the German, French, British post-war tensions and how it affected the way people formed opinions about racing teams. But I really had to strain to get through some parts because his style and sentence structures are not familiar to me.<br /><br />It's on my motorsports book shelf but I don't think it needs to be on yours unless you too are a motorhead.	2005-10-10

Graves does so much in this enjoyable volume. As he takes a canoe trip down the Brazos near where he grew up, he shares the history of the land--both recent and not-so-recent. Through him, we learn the reality of life for the average settler on the edge of the frontier. He also seems to be detailing a life that in his time was declining and in our age is nearly completely gone. His writing is difficult to describe and unlike anything I have ever read. It flows smoothly with a combination of regional speech and erudition. As you read you feel like you are in the canoe with an incomparable guide to this region of our state. A great book that deserves to be read much more widely than it is. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Professor Smith's Natural Philosophy lectures completed in 1780 provide the peopling of America migration schemes and his Theology lectures prepared between 1787 and 1809 provide the theological reasoning.  Though it is not recorded whether he revisited the peopling of America theme after 1780, he did articulate the Darmouth Arminian Theology that parallels the Book of Mormon and early Mormon Doctrine quite closely and is the primary source for View of the Hebrews.   <br /> <br />These theology lectures were not directly available to Solomon Spaulding who graduated in 1785 and only the Old Testament lectures were directly availble to Ethan Smith who graduated in 1790 and later lectures were available indirectly through Ethan's son Lyndon who attended Dartmouth from 1813-17. Since Solomon Spaulding completed Manuscript Found in 1812 and died in 1816,  his nephews James Spaulding who attended the Dartmouth Medical School from 1811 to 1813 and Levi Spaulding who attended Dartmouth College from 1811 to 1815 did not have an opportunity to influence Manuscript Found but were available to play the same type of role in bringing awareness of Manuscript Found to the Dartmouth campus that Lyndon Smith played in bringing Ethan Smith's early theology books started in 1811 to Dartmouth when he arrived in 1813.  <br />   <br /> Joseph Smith would have been only indirectly aware of ideas discussed at Dartmouth through his brother Hyrum, who attended Moor's School between 1811 and 1815 with Indians.  Elijah Lyman a Smith in-law, however, maintained continuous contact with Dartmouth from his nearby Brookfield, Vermont, pastorate where he trained Dartmouth graduates to go on missions to the Indians, including Alfred Finney who graduated in 1814 and trained with Elijah Lyman for a year before going to spend the rest of his life with the Cherokee where he set up the Dwight Indian School. <br />	2005-10-10

This is only my second King book, and as I'm sure everyone else in the world knows, he has a way of making evil seem kind of funny.  Well, maybe that is just me.  The basic rundown here is that All America Boy Todd has a perverted and sinister thought life that ends up taking ownership of his whole life and eventually ruining him.  It's probably based on all of the psycho school shoot-em ups we've had in the past few years, and is probably actually pretty realistic.<br /><br />Anyway, our friend Todd discovers he has an old Nazi war criminal living in his neighborhood, and being the ambitious youngster that he is, decides to befriend/blackmail him and have him tell old war stories.  Well, this relationship mushrooms until at the very end, well, I guess we're left to wonder just how very different we all-American boys are from the horrific Nazis.<br /><br />The story gets REALLY far-fetched at times, but I have really enjoyed King's sense of humor (it's twisted) in what I've read so far.  It's a decent story and it moves quickly.  I have given it four gold stars, as well as rotating status in my chit-chat conversation topic list.	2005-10-10

Let me add my voice to the chorus that is singing the praises of \\"Dog.\\"  Michelle Herman has written a book with soul.  \\"Dog\\" is a work of art that smacks of true life.  Phil, the dog, is of course the star of the show.  He is, just as J.M. Coetzee points out, as compelling a literary character as I've encountered all year and far more likeable than most.  But I think Herman's real triumph is with the Jill \\"J.T.\\" Rosen.  She writes about Jill's loneliness, her struggle with middle age, with a warmth and humor that will endear her to even the most skeptical of readers.  As another reviewer has put it:  \\"The story pulls you straight through, just like Phil pulls Jill on their walks: all the way until midnight, through warm memories and cold weather, and afterwards you know you're a fuller person for having experienced the trip.\\"  Sentiments that I could not have put better myself and which I heartily second. <br /> <br />Buy this book.	2005-10-10
US	49026477	R12OCSHJ9FCIDY	0385722192	598573199	Lullaby	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Brimming with absurd details and weird anecdotes	<br />Lullaby is 260-page novel published in 2002, written by Chuck Palahniuk, the author of Fight Club. This is, for Palahniuk, a normal book, which makes it, compared to the usual, an absolutely crazy, freaked-out book. <br /> <br />The protagonist's name is Carl Streator, a journalist working on an article about SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). He has lost his wife and child twenty years ago and is a dysfunctional man who afflicts pain to himself to forget, to suffer, for his investigations reveal an unlikely connection between the cases of SIDS and the death of his family: every deceased died in sleep, none of them shows any sign of a cause of death, and apparently, each of them had been read the same poem from the same book just the evening before they died. <br /> <br />Streator finally finds a copy and tests the poem on his editor, who promptly passes away and thus makes Streator a murderer. Following that, Streator decides to find all copies of said book and destroy them, because he fears the downfall of civilisation if the poem is made popular and would get into the cogs of mass media. His vision is a world in which language and all artificial, man-made sound are shunned, a new Dark Age, in which communication breaks down, in which men become eremites in the fear of coming into contact with the poem through mere dialogue or background static. Streator, who abhors the noise of his city and his neighbours, subsequently accidentally becomes a serial murderer, for always when somebody pisses him off the poem flits through his mind, which is by now able to kill just by being thought. <br /> <br />Soon Streator meets Helen Hoover Boyle, a real estate broker making money by selling haunted houses, and whose family died the same way Streator's did. Streator, Boyle, her secretary, and the latter's boyfriend leave the city to destroy the remaining books, scattered in public libraries all over America. <br /> <br />Palahniuk utilizes, as he does in his other books, very original means to tell his story. Lullaby abounds with freaky ideas, most of which criticize society relentlessly: there are the most obscure consequences of capitalism, the strange little stories and anecdotes of the absurd areas, which appear fictitious, but are, if you want to believe Palahniuk himself, meticulously researched. Furthermore, Lullaby brims with details, which are Streator's job to notice: the names of dishes, furniture, couples of serial murderers, which are strung together until they lose their sense & coherence. Through constant repetition and variation of snippets of sentences, Palahniuk creates his own melody, which is notable throughout the whole book. Who never saw that style before will be baffled at least. <br /> <br />Regarding the content, Palahniuk weaves criticism against today's society, capitalism, ecological destruction, and blind obedience to mass media, into all elements of the storyline (if that criticism isn't the real story itself), so that the reader notices, while reading, in what a sick world Carl Streator, and maybe the reader himself, is living. Thus, Lullaby leaves behind a stale taste, which is, by all means, intentional. To him who is, by this description, rather attracted than repelled, I whole-heartedly recommend Lullaby. Even without storyline, just for its absurd ideas, this book is already worth reading.	2005-10-10

Armenia has a fascinating history, multi-faceted, struggling against adversity and nevertheless producing talented, highly gifted people. So a good book would be necessary to do them justice.<br /><br />Philip Marsden tries to deliver this, and certainly undertook an effort. He learned Armenian, and traveled through 20 countries, tracing the history of this scattered people. However, as a reader you soon find that distance does not compensate for depth. It is all fairly breathless, a short night spent here, the next night in the next town, or next country. The experiences therefore remain fleeting, rarely reaching any level of insight. In fact, I think you can get pretty much the same information from a Lonely Planet guide, without the distracting personal details thrown in. This is not intrinsic, some of Marsden's other books actually are better in this regard.<br /><br />The style is fine, but since the substance is so thin, the chiseled descriptions end up being an irritating veneer, a writer straining his Thesaurus, rather than a good storyteller. There are occasional irritating elements: I, for one, no longer want to read about Western travelers turning down hookers in Eastern Europe, we have really heard it before and there is no need for the writer to parade his virtue to readers. It is, I should add, only a small irritation: overall, Marsden comes across as a likable person, which matters in travel writing, since you will follow private experiences.<br /><br />So, the book is best described as a broad survey of meeting Armenians in many countries, against the backdrop of the collapsing Soviet Union. Given the shortage of good books on Armenia, it may be a last resort. It may serve as a very basic introduction to Armenia. But otherwise, don't expect too much. If you know the region and like Armenia, the book will add little.<br /><br />I understand that some Armenians feel charmed by the attention, and therefore like the book. I sympathize, but I believe that their people would deserve more depth, and a more reflective understanding. At the same time, I also felt put off by the way Marsden approached Turkey. He essentially walks into Turkey feeling uneasy, and finds confirmation for his sentiments. No big surprise there, and little value added.e like the book.

I read every book that comes out and this one is going to make a big difference in new riders lives. <br /> <br />This book has everything a rider needs to know to get started: preparation, picking out a bike and riding gear, how to work the controls, how to practice, when to take a rider training course, what to do after you get your license, how to get better and get familiar with different types of roads and traffic, safe riding procedures, and more.  <br /> <br />What's really cool is the way Mr Hahn reveals some of the mysteries of riding (countersteering, mental overload, what other books to read along the way) and also attacks some myths that go along with riding, like \\"If I had to explain, you wouldn't understand\\" and \\"laying it down\\" and \\"there are two kinds of riders\\" etc.  <br /> <br />Rider attitudes one through four will keep me alive for a long long time, even for an experienced rider I was surprised how much I learned about attitude and evaluating my ability. <br /> <br />There's also a section with drills and stuff to practice on your own after you take the MSF course but before you really head out into traffic. You could probably do these drills whether or not you took the course. <br /> <br />It's easy to read, too, and humorous at times, not as funny as his other book, but this one has way cooler photos and diagrams and important advice for hungry new riders. Anybody who's thinking about getting into riding, or anybody who has been been riding for less than two years should get this book. <br /> <br />I'll be loaning my copy to my nephew when he turns 16.

Osama bin Laden, of course, was one of those terrorists. <br /> <br />Mamdani conclusions on how to deal political Islamic terrorism seem valuable and correct.  <br /> <br />The book is flawed only in the style of writing used by the author.

I quit the chapter half-way through and moved on to Chapter 2. <br /> <br />Despite Chapter 1 and some other disconnectedness in the Mamdani's presentation and style, his ideas in the remainder of the book present valuable insights on the genesis and development of Islamic terrorism.

On the one hand, this book is widely considered a masterpiece, and friends who know my reading tastes were shocked that I hadn't read and fallen in love with this book.  On the other hand, the (newer) copy of the book I read starts out with a pretty lame preface by the author: he writes about what great reviews the book got, and how well-received the book was.  It's hard not to come away from such a self-congratulatory preface without a bad taste in your mouth. <br /> <br />So did the book live up to the hype?  No, not really.  Heller is exceedingly clever at times, and he displays a masterful command of the language.  The characters are all top-notch - well illustrated and interesting to read about.   <br /> <br />However, the flaws were also very apparent.  Catch-22 weighs in at 452 pages; while the characters remain interesting, the zany predicaments they land themselves in become repetitious.  For example, a chapter after Yossarian learns about 'Catch-22', he has a conversation with a prostitute, who tells him that she won't marry him because he's insane, and he's insane because he wants to marry her.  I felt like I was reading a recycled joke - nowhere near the laugh-out-loud hilarity I was expecting.   <br /> <br />The story is not told in a linear fashion - characters will talk about an event in chapter 2 that isn't described until chapter 10 - and this gives the story a meandering, episodic sitcom sort of feeling.  Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't.  So far as themes go, the book does a decent job of mixing absurd inanity with serious war-time events, but I personally feel that Vonnegut mixes tragedy and comedy far more skillfully than Heller. <br /> <br />Also, I thought Catch-22 would be the story of Yossarian trying to act crazy in order to bypass Catch-22, but this isn't the case.  Catch-22 is really a collection of loosely-related zany incidents that Yossarian's squadron go through - the story of \\"Catch-22\\" is really just one in a series of clever conversations.  <br /> <br />Despite all my reservations, Catch-22 is still a better book than most books you'll read, and most definitely worth reading if you haven't already.  I just felt that all of the unqualified praise that this book is getting needed some counterpoint.	2005-10-10

Olivia Dagwood and Vincent Vittorio are two of the hottest stars of the big screen. They decide to wed, but want to do it with a thrilling twist. This couple wants to go into the San Juan Mountains for canyoning, followed by an elaborate wedding with nature surrounding them and the stars above them. They hire Eli McCain of Thrillseekers Anonymous \\"TA\\" to make it happen.  <br /> <br />Eli and his TA partners have no problem with the canyoning. They are extreme-sports enthusiasts who have tackled every high risk adventure imaginable. Kite surfing on hurricane winds is minor stuff for these stuntmen. However, when it comes to arranging wedding, they are clueless. So they set up auditions to hire a wedding coordinator.  <br /> <br />Marnie Banks is thrilled to get the job. She has dreams of making connections in Hollywood and becoming THE wedding planner of the stars. Easier said than done, because Olivia and Vincent break up and make up almost daily. Even worse, Olivia keeps changing her mind on how she wants the wedding done. Then there is Eli. He may be the stunt coordinator and look like every woman's fantasy, but he knows next to nothing about the finer things in life. Still, whenever Marnie and Eli are together things heat up in the romance department.  <br /> <br />Then a freak storm comes up one night. Eli, Marnie, the wedding couple, and a chef are stranded on the wrong side of a ravine. They have only meager supplies and their lives become like a \\"Survivor\\" TV episode. But all the guests on the right side of the ravine have popped open the expensive champagne and are having the party to beat all parties! Sometimes it seems as though Life peels the lemons and rolls them in mud before giving them to you. But Marnie and Eli will find another way to make lemonade.  <br /> <br />***** This novel is a fun romp through the mountains with a side of adventure. Author Julia London has written an irresistible romance with some comic relief that will capture the imagination of all her readers. People who enjoy outdoor sports will especially enjoy this novel, where everything that could go wrong, does. Highly recommended! *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-10-10

I picked this up on a whim at our local bookstore as something to read to my 8 year old son to kill some time in the store.  What a surprise!  It starts out a little slow, but it is rhymy and the illlustrations are full color, full page, so we kept going.  Boy, was I glad we did!  It turns out that the scarecrow encourages the boy to read a bunch of classic children's literature over one summer.  The message of the book is that books can take you anywhere you want to go - a great advocate for literacy in our sound-byte, instant gratification, video game world.  My son decided he wanted to buy and read a classic!! (ironically not one mentioned in the book, but still a classic)  The books recommended by Scarecrow Pete include (now these are only a few that I can remember off the top of my head) Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, Moby Dick, and more.  The rhyming nature and illustrations would appeal to a child younger than one able to read those level of books independently, so I think this is one book that would last several years.  A good investment, in my opinion.	2005-10-10

While it was a fast read and interesting, it was very basic in the level of forensics it described.  If you have watched any forensic television in the past, this is not the book for you.  I hope that in the future, Mr. Temple would go a bit deeper, including not well known forensics to teach the reader a few things.  There were interesting side plots about the acting deputy coroners in the office and some of the office politics, but all in all I felt disappointed to spend so much on a very short book that offered no new insights.	2005-10-10

It does contain faults. For one the narrative is told a little clumbsily through letters and diaries and there are also perhaps mistakes in characterisation, but at the core is a heartfelt tale of a woman who falls in love with a man whom she marries, but we slowly watch his decline into a drunken, selfish slob, who not only breaks Helen's heart but the reader's too. Readers who dislike the character of Mr Huntington from the start will probably not much like the rest of the book, because they can see what a mistake she is making, but i, like Helen, made the foolish and naive error of believing that she can change him for the better. It's certainly worth reading if you are a Bronte fan and is perhaps a slightly forgotten masterpiece of Victorian literacy, shadowed by family connections.	2005-10-10

That Paul Bryant came from where he did and accomplished what he did makes this a story of the American Dream in the flesh..the flesh and blood of Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant...Thoroughly researched, well written, a fitting tribute to the coach and the man Allen Barra admires...it is not perfect, as Coach Bryant was not perfect, but it's pretty close...Unfortunately, at times, Barra becomes an apologist for Coach Bryant rather than a true biographer..his colors and his admiration come through a bit too much at times, and that's unfortunate because Coach Bryant needs no one to apologize or defend him. His record and his legacy of contribution do that far better than a biographer, even a biographer as good as this one, could ever do...Those few occasions, however, do little to affect the quality and accomplisment of this book.       It's a winner, a big winner,and even people who not enjoy or appreciate college football, can enjoy this book because of its heroic and epic American Dream qualities.  Good job, Mr. Barra.

It is merely just like stacking two of the older paperbacks and wrapping in a hardcover.<br /><br />Ever since starting NavArch, the faculty at my school list this as a definite optional text for anyone who might need a little more explanation of things that they couldn't get from the school's course books (if they don't already use it.) The staff were \\"loyalists\\" in that they went with the SNAME texts (SD&C, SSD, PNA) as well as ANA by Zubaly for primary texts. They were confident that if you have a the money the first optional text to get would be Basuc Ship Theory. Our freshly graduated fro U of M professor broke mould and dropped the SNAME texts and fully switched to BST for the first semester Ship Statics course.<br /><br />I am one semester out from graduating. The SNAME golden oldies are valuable as references and should be mandatory texts. As priamry texts they are a little dry though. I feel there should be a central course text book that portrays things in plain english for the uneducated with worked examples. It should be capable of raising a \\"rookie\\" first semester sophmore to an \\"apprentice\\" first semester junior. BST does this well and is a \\"total package\\" that covers a lot without going to far into dusty reference category.

It carries a great deal of weight in today's ideologically charged environment. <br /> <br />Yu Yuan is fighting on Korean soil on behalf of a cause, Communism, that he does not believe in. He was conscripted into battle. He is not very enthusiastic about the counter-revolutionary force in China, Nationalism, either.  <br /> <br />Instead, Yu wants nothing except to return to a quiet family life back in China with his mother and fiance. After he is captured by the Americans and placed in a Korean prison camp as a Chinese POW, Yu finds it necessary to choose sides: communism or nationalism. Either choice carries immense risk. Fellow prisoners try, often violently, to extract loyalism from Yu, to ensure his allegiance. Prison life becomes very difficult for Yu, and it has nothing to do with his American guards. <br /> <br />This is the story about a man who is forced to make a difficult choice between two ideologies he does not believe in. The choice becomes a matter of life and death. <br /> <br />In the end, his choice is made on the basis of family, friendship and trust, not on the basis of either ideology. <br /> <br />The novel shows quite clearly how an ordinary man can be drawn into a world of powerful ideas and violent competition, a world that he does not want to participate in.  <br /> <br />In a broader context, the novel shows the immense power of abstract political thought in shaping the long-term destiny of nations and their citizens.	2005-10-10

His advice is just as relevant to the would-be screenwriter today as it was when he wrote it.<br /><br />His \\"Proposed Scene for Kubrick's Rhapsody,\\" and \\"Plums and Prunes,\\" provide interesting examples of proposed movie scenes that will prove interesting to readers unfamiliar with that arcane art.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, \\"Grooving in Chi\\" is an excellent description of the Chicago riots during the Democratic National Convention in 1968.<br /><br />Finally, pieces like \\"The Beautiful-Ugly Art of Lotte Lenya,\\" \\"When Film Gets Good,\\" \\"Rolling Over Our Nerve-Endings [William Burroughs],\\" and \\"Writers at Work [Henry Green]\\" prove that he could write serious criticism.<br /><br />Through it all flows that wonderful, irreverent, sense of humor.<br /><br />Good stuff.	2005-10-10

Let me say off the bat I own the 2nd book in the Harrow trilogy and plan on reading it...And I'm going to buy Mr. Clegg's newest book when released.  BUT, Mischief was good, just not great.  There was some very interesting ideas he played with, but there wasn't a lot of resolution, and I wanted more.  What sort of power does Jim have?  What really happened at the end there?  I could go on with additional questions, but I will say that a number of scenes were very well done and had me turning the pages at a quick clip.  Overall - good, not great, but I'll keep with Mr. Clegg and his books.  Thanks!	2005-10-10

I got this book a few weeks ago and have about 20-25lbs to lose (just had a baby).  I lost 10lbs in 2 weeks, just like it said I would!  It's all extremely healthy and I thought I ate really well already but I was sorely mistaken when I read this book.  It shows how much the bad carbs spike the sugar levels in your body and what actually happens long term.  It's such an informative book.  My sister and father have diabetes and I told them all about this book and both of them purchased it.  My sister might even be able to stop having to give herself shots of insulin eventually!

Most younger Americans know about the anti-war movement from first-hand film accounts of the massive marches and sit-ins. Yet far fewer know the extent of  resistance within the armed forces themselves. There are no video tapes of widespread clashes between MP's and GI protesters during war's peak period. Nor is there footage of  crew members demonstrating aboard such elite ships as the USS Kitty Hawk, nor even from blue-collar vessels such as the USS Nitro (a humorous and inspiring episode). Yet the resistance in many instances proved doggedly disruptive. And despite silencing efforts by the Pentagon and its media allies, the war's outcome was seriously affected by thousands of courageous resisters in uniform, who, each in his own way, refused to support a murderous politicians' war.    Cortright exhaustively documents stateside developments from Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, to Camp Pendleton, California, plus the role of civilian supporters in facilitating the movement. Coverage of GI resistance in Vietnam is harder to document because of battlefield censorship. Nonetheless, revealing instances of fragging, combat avoidance, and conscience-baring convocations such as Winter Soldier are included and speak volumes. Cortright's approach is sympathetically objective, providing a good birdseye view of what was going on behind the general coverup. Morover, he's careful to point out those cultural factors which intensified resistance, including widespread racism for which black resisters bore the brunt. If there's a downside, it's the absence of subjective, first-hand accounts that would make the reader feel the oppressive weight of the war machine as it attempted to roll over those who would stand in its way. In addition, some material in Part II has dated and perhaps should have been elided, while a 2005 Postscript begs for comparisons with Iraq but proves somewhat disappointing.    Nonetheless, the length and breadth of resistance is meticulously set forth, along with some surprising results -- enlistees were more likely to resist than draftees; the least educated were more likely to physically resist than the more educated. But most importantly, the research shows a rapidly disintegrating fighting force that belies apologist claims that the war was lost because it was fought \\"with one arm tied behind us\\". No, the war was lost because it was one that should never have been fought in the first place, as increasing numbers of those participating came to realize, (not to discount the astonishing will of the Vietnamese people to resist Western neo-colonialism) . All in all, this is an excellent resource for those wondering what  actually went on inside the processing centers, the training bases, and the killing fields during a tumultuous period that in so many ways is still with us.	2005-10-10

The stories were written while my wife, my cat, and I were living on a sailboat and cruising The Bahamas in 2004. Coming from the small town of Hannibal, MO I found myself missing home. Writing these stories reminded me of growing up. All of the characters come from family members and friends but the stories are pure fiction. <br /> <br />     In this book you will find laughter, sadness, adventure, and love. If I have done my job correctly these stories will stir emotions in you about the holidays. There are a total of 9 stories and each one is completely different. <br /> <br />Excerpt   \\"They poked and prodded the meat for awhile and decided he wasn't completely frozen.

This book is hilarious, witty, and an acerbic poke in the eye at our current image obsessed culture of superficial beauty and style.  Fielding is also spot on in her location descriptions. Clearly she has done some travel in between churning out bestsellers.<br /><br />Ms. Joules, a minimized features journalist, carving out a living and trying to keep her self esteem in the face of idiot editors and budget conscious news directors, stumbles into an apparent Al Qaeda terrorist plot to... well, you'll have to read about it for yourself. No spoilers here. From L.A.'s Standard Hotel, to Miami,  Honduras, and the Sudan, Olivia Joules becomes increasingly suspicious of her new exotic romantic pursuer Pierre - is he French or Arab or both?  What does he really do for a living?  Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not after you, baby. I almost hate to write the comparison, but think: Carrie Bradshaw meets the Sheikh.<br /><br />Some reviewers are shocked - shocked! - to read a comedic novel that touches on current terror conflicts  and - gasp!- Osama Bin Laden himself.  Well, get over it. This is how we reduce the enemy. We mock it. To wit: parody posters of Hitler as a rodent during WWII; M*A*S*H; Hogan's Heros,  James Bond and the Soviet KGB, and countless more.  As one reviewer notes, this is a screenplay waiting to happen. And I can hardly wait.	2005-10-10

I just finished the book and, while there were some errors and omissions, I was still able to figure out what to do and troubleshoot the errors -- including my own typos. That, I think, added to the learning experience. <br /> <br />Where I find the most fault with the book is in the lack of explanation of exactly what you're doing. Do this, do that, fine, but give me a better idea of what I'm doing and why so I can learn and carry it over to my own projects. As it stands now I have a working site -- although, I still need to figure out why the sound doesn't work on my finished project. Just don't ask me what or why I did what I did in quite a few circumstances. <br /> <br />I'm going to have to go through a reference book to see what some of the things I did were and why they worked.  <br /> <br />Kind of a shame as most of what was done is exactly what I wanted to learn to do. The other books I've looked at and read weren't nearly as directed to my needs as this one.

I am not and never have been a romance reader, but I'll always read Hollings books.  She is that good.  And I have to agree with M. Rondeau: Holling saved the best for last.  I didn't see how she could possibly do any better than the riveting first two books of the McDonnell series, but My Shadow Warrior is like the finale of a dazzling fireworks display.  Rose is such an endearing heroine, and her dilemmas (saving her dying father, trying to escape a past of abuse at the hands of a 'foster' family) make for a heart of compassion as well as inevitable faults.  Very realistic, very identifiable.  And hero William McKay breaks the mold when it comes to love interests.  His past is as tortured, if not more, than Rose's, and his heart is just as big. The darkness surrounding him adds tension to his and Rose's already tense and knee-weakening attraction. And readers of the first two novels will be glad to see Gillian and Isobel again as they work with Rose to get to the bottom of their father's illness.

Don't get me wrong, I think he does a great service esp for us women because we're too understanding, too nice, or whatever the case may be.  I thought his first book was a God-send, but this one was kind of more of the same stuff.  I don't discount his advice, but there's something missing; there's no positive focus on when it might be right to work it out or why it's important and healthy to want to talk things out.  A person is not weak for wanting to understand \\"what happened.\\"  It's when someone goes overboard and won't let go, and I realize that is probably the emotional starting point for this book. <br /> <br />I realize, from my own recent experience, that some people (not just men) can be present during the course of a breakup and there are those who simply check out and run away.  Greg seems to focus on just that one type of person.  And so I think his advice is on target when it comes to the emotionally spineless person who runs from a breakup; the kind who sends all kinds of mixed signals and then blindsides the person who is in love with them.  It happened to me, and I understand the pain of that kind of breakup.  I tried to talk to my boyfriend and he wouldn't see me or talk to me.  It was the shock of my life; I never saw it coming, truly.  If I have anything to pass on, it is important to hold yourself in as much dignity as possible; but don't beat yourself up if you email him or call; you're human and you are hurt and it is natural and healthy to want to understand what happened, esp if you never saw it coming.   <br /> <br />Again, I'm not discounting the advice Greg gives here; I just found it to be more of the same stuff from his first book. <br /> <br />But the best advice is to remember that you are a superfox and don't waste the pretty.  For those of you hurting, you are not alone; it sucks; you will get over it, it just takes timeand that's the hard part, and I know you want to know so badly what he (or she) is thinking.  And when that person refuses to be present or emotionally available that's a whole other level of rejection to deal with. <br /> <br />This too shall pass, and there is someone out there who will see you for the awesome person you are.  Greg is right on that one.  Focus your energy on that reality, and slowly you'll forget the nightmare you just went through.  The more you can focus on attracting the love you deserve, and giving your attention to that, the more you will see your break up was probably a blessing.  Time moves slowly for the brokenhearted ... I know.	2005-10-10

What he ends up with is a variety of veiled threats from police hierarchy and the feds to lay off, which of course, just pushes him further into the investigation. As Bosch continues his digging the reader begins to perceive that what seems to be a promising storyline ends up being fairly predictable tale of greed and revenge with innocents caught in the middle. For a number of other writers this would have been good work but for Connelly it comes off as more than a little disappointing. It was nowhere near as emotionally involving as the other Bosch novels I've read; it comes off a bit perfunctory. There is a major surprise in Bosch's personal life revealed within, but even that comes off as anti-climactic. It's three stars because even bad Connelly is better than most, it is always readable and entertaining but it isn't up to par. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

I have enjoyed works by  King, Straub, McCammon, Herbert, Matheson and others too numerous to mention.  I bring this up because I sense some \\"horror elitism\\" in a few of the bad reviews for Edward Lee's \\"Flesh Gothic\\" which is a cracking good haunted house novel despite many graphic scenes that enhance, rather than take away from the plot. <br /> <br />Mr. Lee's prose is lean, spare and he moves the plot along at a quick pace that still takes the time for character development, something that is lacking in recent horror.  To synopsize, the \\"widow\\" of a billionaire businessman/porn peddler hires a team of psychics, an exorcist and a writer to investigate Hildreth House, a 66 room mansion in which a dreadful massacre occurred.  The wife does not believe that the husband is dead, and explains that her husband dabbled in porn as a means to achieve his true interest in life, that of a satanist. <br /> <br />Anyway, numerous plot turns, psychic jargon and phenomena are introduced and the house lives up to it's nasty reputation.  Mr. Lee doesn't pull punches, he just doesn't state that the house is awful and evil and blithely go in another direction.  Mr. Lee rubs the readers face into the scenes that prove why the house is evil and although some scenes are too pornographic for popular taste, they actually enhance the plot by forcing the reader to realize, along with his characters, the immensity of the evil that they are facing in the house. <br /> <br />A much gorier, nastier version of Richard Matheson's seminal Haunted House novel \\"Hell House\\".  Any reader who enjoyed \\"Hell House\\", \\"Ghost Story\\", \\"The Shining\\" and \\"The Survivor\\" will enjoy Edward Lee.  However, \\"Flesh Gothic\\" is not for those who favor \\"psychological\\" horror.	2005-10-10

This one is my favorite because I like the fonts better.  The UBS version is harder on the eyes and I just don't like to read it as much as this one.<br /><br />The technical apparatus is superior to the 3rd edition with many changes and improvements.  Still, it's tough to decipher the apparatus unless you spend a lot of time learning how to interpret it...or you are really sharp.  To make better sense out of the apparatus, one needs Metzger's Textual Commentary as a companion.  It looks and feels like this version of the NT...so there's some emotional pay off if you care about that sort of thing.<br /><br />The cross references are also nice if you are doing sermon exegesis...usually there are some great passages to tie into a point hidden in those little cross references and they are worth looking up.  That's not really new though since the 2nd and 3rd editions had the same benefit. Some scholars like the cross references in the UBS version better. I have not seen a lot of difference...but I'm no scholar either.<br /><br />The best Greek NT I have overall is the Novum Testamentum Graece published by Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft.  It has the most helpful cross references, although I don't like the fonts on it as much as this one.<br /><br /> So it may be useful to have that edition for that purpose.<br /><br />Overall I'm very glad that I bought this one.

This is a mature comic--not in the sense of gratuitous sex or violence, but that, like Greg Rucka's Batman: Death and the Maidens, this comic book doesn't pander to its audience.  Instead, it offers an intriguing look at how the heroes of the DC Universe might deal with morally ambiguous Justice League-caliber threats without sullying the Justice League's reputation. Great action, great mystery, great characterization--and moreover, realistic characterization that looks at the big questions of heroism.

The fact that you are only 33 and think that you have a grasp of what slavery and civil rights were about is laughable.

I have seen in countless critiques of my own work, for example, that recalling historical facts will only rekindle the hatreds of the past. Of course, the opposite is true: recalling the past, and the facts of history, is an important, indeed, critical antidote to hatreds, as they offer the only sure way of avoiding the errors of bygone eras.<br /><br />If we refuse to acknowledge those errors, we are consigned to repeating them. And today, with so much emphasis placed on the importance of relative \\"narratives\\" and so little emphasis placed on facts, knowledge itself--and all the libraries that secure it--stands highly at risk.<br /><br />This book is a fantastic and much needed treatment for the disease of relativism. Not only does it offer myriad details on the various schools of thought that have brought us to the current desperate pass, but it contains a stunning set of historical facts as well.<br /><br />One learns for example a bit about the Aztecs' conquest by Cortes, the mutiny on the HMS Bounty in 1789, French deconstructionist Michel Focault, and the end of the cold war in 1989. Windschuttle uses those pieces of data to illustrate his points.<br /><br />Today one risk one runs \\"in defending anything traditional is to be seen simply as a knee-jerk reactionary,\\" he writes, \\"a middle aged academic defending the remnants of his own intellectual capital\\" while holding the fort against younger ideologues. But that reaction is a dead letter, as the vast majority of professors pushing \\"the new humanities\\" have entered their forties or fifties, and many of the Continental gurus that floated these history-bashing ideas are \\"already dead.\\"<br /><br />No, the truth and history are at stake. Windschuttle makes a great case for studying the \\"old-fashioned\\" facts. Let us hope that a majority in the professoriate soon see the light of his wisdom.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

With his magnificent looks and sweet tongue, he had many women, single and married, swooning over him. But when he experienced one too many betrayals by his ex-wife and stepmother, the former resulting to the death of his beloved daughter, the other to his father's death and loss of their land and wealth, he vows to never trust another woman for the rest of his life. For two years, he has succeeded in shielding his emotions and lives for the day when he could avenge his father's death and reclaim Leargan, the land that Colin MacFarlane stole from the MacDubh's. Then one day, he discovers that his brother Barra has sired three children with the late Mairi MacFarlane. Within hours, Alex and his men were riding towards Leargan intent on claiming back the children. And Fate seemed to be smiling at him for in one swoop, it wasn't only his niece and nephews who land in his lap, but the sole MacFarlane heiress as well - the beautiful Ailis.<br /><br />Strong-willed and spirited, Ailis passes herself off as the children's nurse, knowing the price that the MacDubhs would demand as ransom for all of them. But her cover doesn't last very long when Barra lays eyes on her and mistakes her for the woman he once loved. And when Alex learns about the value of his captive, he couldn't believe his luck and decides to extract vengeance from Donald MacCordy by bedding his betrothed. But Alex never expected that Fate has actually given him the woman who will be his undoing.<br /><br />RECKLESS is the third of Hannah Howell's first earlier Highland series, the first one being AMBER FLAME followed by PROMISED PASSION. In those first two books, Alexander was always the charming courtier giving competition to his friends Tavis and Ian MacLagan. So I was quite surprised to see him in a serious role, that of a bitter man who has suffered the treachery of the opposite sex who he once adored. I was a little saddened to see him a mere shadow of his former self and couldn't wait for Ailis to break the wall he has built around his heart and bring him down on his knees. And that's what she does of course! It doesn't take long for Ailis to figure out the man that Alex has become and she strives to prove to him that not all women are capable of treachery, that there are many trustworthy and loving women out there who will give their all to the man they love.<br /><br />This book also features a good supporting cast, notably the children and the ever-loyal Jamie. I laughed so much when little Sybeal nearly knocks the daylight out of her uncle Alexander and threatens to make a eunuch of him. That, for me, was the most fun part of the story. And who wouldn't adore Jamie's loyalty to Ailis? He was a friend that anyone would be lucky to have.<br /><br />Overall, this was a pretty enjoyable read though it lacks the spark and tenderness that I loved in AMBER FLAME. To this day, that remains one of my favorite novels. You will understand once you read it. The passion, tenderness and laughter shared by Tavis and Storm is something to cherish and one I always look for when reading other Scottish books by Hannah Howell.adow of his former self and couldn't wait for Ailis to break the wall he has built around his heart and bring him down on his knees.

Rather than the fact that almost all of it is utterly ridiculous, something that should be apparent to anyone over the age of 10 who isn't on some sort of mild-altering medication.      So here's the deal:  Jesus Christ died so that we could have no responsibility for any bad things we've ever done in our lives.  If we murdered 1,000 people in cold blood, we merely have to say the magic words and Jesus forgives us and we don't have to pay any restitution to society or anyone.  God loves us because we believe in his Only Begotten Son even though we murdered 1,000 people with godly souls.      So far, I see nothing wrong with this.  It makes perfect sense to me.  It's like a Godly Plea Bargain, only instead of having our sentence reduced, we're actually REWARDED, because now we get to spend eternity in Heaven with all the poofy clouds and wingy angels.  It would be kind of like if we gave high-def TV sets and inflato-dolls and lots of expensive presents to criminals who are serving life sentence because they said \\"I Wuv God.\\"     But to get to the crux of \\"Of Pandas And People,\\" this is the biggest insult to anyone's functioning brain that I've run across in as long as I can remember.  If you've taken three hours of a junior high school biology class you should know you're being lied to.  It's more disingenuous than I thought anything could possibly be.    So getting back to my initial premise, even though accepting Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and getting a permanent place in Heaven applies to murderers, rapists, kidnappers, child abusers, and every rotten person ever born who merely says \\"God had a baby boy and I invited him into my life!\\", God MUST have an exception to this rule.  And that exception should clearly apply to everybody who had anything to do with bringing this deliberately deceitful, insultingly stupid, and terribly written book onto the marketplace.  These people clearly should be punished for all of eternity, if not substantially longer.     If there is any sort of Heavenly Justice, letting vast segments of our populace know that Bible-thumping Christians actually believe this horse-poopy excuse for a book will hopefully hasten the downfall of the Religious Right's power.	2005-10-10

This book, in general, provides excellent overviews to basic terms and concepts that one might encounter in reading such writers as Derrida, Foucault, etc.  This is certainly something to have on hand if you are planning on dealing with any religious/biblical scholarship that strays from the traditional metanarrative.  The book is organized by topic and I'll list them below.  Some articles are better than others (the Derrida one seems to be particularly bad) but overall it is much better than trying to start from scratch and make heads or tails of postmodern mumbo jumbo if you aren't familiar with the basics, even if the articles are sometimes not perfect.  Articles include:   <br />anti-postmodernism <br />author <br />autobiography <br />bakhtin <br />bataille <br />blanchot <br />certeau <br />culture/cultural criticism <br />deconstruction <br />deleuze and guattari <br />derrida <br />ethics <br />fantasy <br />foucault <br />gender <br />historiography <br />identity <br />ideaology <br />intertextuality <br />irigaray <br />jameson <br />kristeva <br />lacan <br />levinas <br />lyotard <br />midrash <br />politics <br />postcolonialism <br />practice <br />process <br />queer theory <br />race <br />rhetoric <br />scholarship <br />sexuality <br />space <br />theory <br />translation <br />trauma <br />truth <br /> <br />To me, there is a notable absense of an entry on poststructuralism and/or structuralism, but I guess everything can't be covered in one book.  Overall, very helpful to have on hand and even if you are minimally intersted in the \\"biblical/religious\\" part to things, the introductions are generally not specific to religious/biblical studies until near the end of the article.  Overall they can be just good introductions for anyone who needs introductory writing on postmodernism.	2005-10-10

US	30798114	R2Q1P2H6W4HIT2	0393314049	545651465	The Principles of Mathematics	Books	5	82	87	N	N	Russell's Magnum Opus	Bertrand Russell's greatest pieces of philosophical writing could probably be said to be &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot;, &quot;On Denoting&quot; and with Alfred North Whitehead &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;. There is however one sense in which it could be said that the russellian magnum opus is The Principles of Mathematics, from here on TPM.<br /><br />  TPM is, arguably, the culmination in print of a long process of thought and concern, philosophically speaking, of Russell's intellectual preoccupations from his adolescence, youth and maturity with questions relating to the foundations of mathematics. Ever since Russell read Mill in his adolescence he had thought there was something suspect with the Millian view that mathematical knowledge is in some sense empirical &amp; that mathematics is, so to speak, the most abstract of empirical sciences, but empirical nonetheless. Though he lacked the sophistication at the time to propose a different philosophy of mathematics, his concerns with these topics remained with him well into the completion of Principia Mathematica. Logic and Mathematics were, by that time, seen as separate subjects dealing with distinct subject-matters; it came to be, however, the intuition of Russell (an intuition shared, and indeed, anticipated by Frege) that mathematics was nothing more than the later stages of logic. He did not come into this view easily; after a long period of Hegelianism and Kantianism in philosophy, in which Russell sought to overcome the so called antinomies of the infinite and the infinitesimal, etc; Russell saw light coming, not from the works of philosophers, but from the work of mathematicians working to introduce rigour into mathematics. Through the developments introduced by such mathematicians as Cantor and Dedekind Russell saw, or indeed thought he saw, that the difficulties in the notion of infinite and infinitesimal could be dealt with by solely mathematical methods, and it was through the continued development of formal logic by Peano and his followers that Russell saw the possibility of defining the notions of zero, number &amp; successor in purely logical terms. Before all of these developments and ideas were put together by Russell and developed into the philosophy of mathematics known as logicism, he made several sophisticated though unsuccesful attempts at questions having to do with the foundations of mathematics, one such attempt is his &quot;An Analysis of Mathematical Reasoning&quot; (now in the Collected Papers). In TPM all of these developments are taken together with the formal logic Russell was developing following the steps of Peano, indeed the TRUE foundations of mathematics are for Russell: the calculus of classes, the propositional calculus and the predicate calculus. Of course, for Russell, the notion of class is a purely logical notion which is defined intensionally, by the comprehension axiom, rather than extensionally, by the enumeration of its members. This means that a class can be determined solely by a property which all of its members share. For example, the property of being blue determines the class of all blue things. The view that every property determines a class is what leads to Russell's paradox (more on this below).<br /><br />  Indeed, the book not only presents these developments, argues for them and introduces the reader to the theoretical and philosophical edifice of formal logic, but also with these tools Russell delves in an exploration of all or most concepts relevant in the mathematics of the day. As promised, he shows that Peano's primitives in the Peano-Dedekind axioms: zero, number &amp; succesor, can be defined in purely logical terms (according to his view of logic which is not philosophically neutral). He gives a definition of cardinal number in terms of one-one relations betwen classes. Indeed, a cardinal number is just the number of a class of similar classes, that is, the number of a class is the class of all classes similar to the given class &amp; two classes are similar if and only if there is a one-one bijection beween their members. For instance, the number '2' is the class of all couples and the term 'couple' can be further analysed through quantification &amp; identity (thus the definition is not circular). With this, &amp; Peano's axioms, he gets the natural numbers &amp; shows that with the methods he proposes he can construct the whole of the real numbers, and that the concept of infinity can be dealt with through the set-theory of Cantor. Russell's theory of relations, a theory which made possible to deal with relations in formal logic as well as to refute the metaphysical views of Bradley and others, appears in the book. The problem of the unity of the proposition, as well as perennial difficulties in the philosophy of language, rear their heads. The chapter on &quot;The Philosophy of the Infinite&quot; is a tour de force for anyone interested in the philosophy of mathematics. Zeno's paradoxes are discussed with the new methods, yielding valuable insights. Russell even engages in a brief, yet sophisticated, discussion of the philosophy of matter towards the end of the book.<br /><br />  This book is quite long, but it is absolutely breathtaking in its depth, its subtle arguments, its sophistication and originality (for its time). The book already contains a philosophy of language and reference not all that different from that of Frege in &quot;Sense and Reference&quot;, though less sophisticated, still capable on its own of dealing with definite &amp; indefinite descriptions via the use of the denoting concept (this gives the theory enough resources to deal w both impossible &amp; non-existent objects). As I said, it is thorough in its philosophical examination and explanation of mathematical concepts, and it delves into physics through the russellian investigation of space and time, as well as his incorporation of logicism into physics through rational dynamics.<br /><br />  Russell's paradox makes its first appeareance in this book, it has a chapter to itself. Given Russell's assumption that every property determines a class, one might ask, what of the property of not being a member of itself, a property which some classes have, like the class of humans, it is not a human &amp; therefore not a member of itself. But then, what of the class of all those classes which are not members of themselves? If the class is a member of itself, then it is not. But if it is not, then it is, the class is a member of itself if and only if it is not a member of itself. This paradox puts the entire philosophical project at risk, Frege would respond to it by saying that the only possible foundation of mathematics has been shattered. Indeed, a sketch of Russell's theory of types, his eventual solution to the paradox, also makes an appearance in one of the books appendix's.<br /><br />  It is well known that Russell and Frege each came to his views independently, and indeed Russell had just read Frege by the time his book had been finished and so added another appendix discussing and commending Frege's work. Probably the first philosophical discussion of Frege's work in the English-speaking world.<br /><br />  All in all, this book is worth every penny, it is one of the masterpieces of XXth century philosophy by any standards. One professor of mine once remarked that if Russell had developed his famous theory of descriptions by the time he wrote TPM and had included it in the book, the already masterpiece would then be wholly perfect, I am inclined to agree.l classes similar to the given class &amp; two classes are similar if and only if there is a one-one bijection beween their members.

Although this commentary is well written and valuable, I am returning it after reading about 170 pages because:<br /><br />1.  It is superceded by newer commentaries (such as the Word commentary by Wenham) making it mostly superfluous if you have these others.<br /><br />2.  There is too much focus in this text on the documentary hypothesis.  Although this is perhaps important in a commentary on Genesis, Westermann has made this the central focus of his commentary.  Many sections are the theology of P is, J said this because, the reason E did this was... I prefer the way other newer commentaries have treated documentary hypothesis issues as part of a whole, not the focus.<br /><br />Altogether it is a great commentary, i would have given it four stars if not for the other more up-to-date commentaries that offer a more balanced view of what Westermann offers plus newer material.<br /><br />BTW the other commentaries I have are: Word by Wenham, Interpretations by Brueggemann, New Internation Commentary by Hamilton, and New American Commentary by Mathews.

A central character of the book, David Becker, is described as \\"dark-rugged, youthful ... sharp green eyes and wit to match. His strong jaw and taut features reminded Susan (heroine cryptographer for the NSA) of carved marble.\\" Becker, a brilliant foreign language specialist and full professor, has no clue who or what the NSA might be - that is a mere nine pages into the book. <br /> <br />The end of the modern world is at hand. First, because the NSA won't be able to sneak a look at everyone's secrets due to a do-gooder's efforts (misguided of course) to share his unbreakable code. Second, because - well, I won't ruin the story. <br /> <br />Author Dan Brown of The Da Vinci Code, Deception Point and Angels & Demons, fails to provide any real insight into the workings of the NSA, its computers or cryptology. <br /> <br />Digital Fortress was entertaining, but simple.

My husband and I thought we were doing well when we got married a few months ago and combined our incomes. We make about 140k a year but at the end of every month, we kept realizing that we weren't able to save anything. Everything that didn't go towards student loans, bills, and mortgage went straight towards paying off our credit card charges every month. We decided to do something about it and needed a written budget. At the advice of a friend, we started listening to Dave Ramsey and even bought his book. <br /> <br />I got the book in the mail on a Monday and the following Sunday I was already done reading it. People have left reviews about how everything in the book is just common sense but I disagree. While some people have been taught well in the area of finances by their parents or what not, most people aren't taught these things, even if you're the smartest person you know. Society, friends, and banks tell you that financing things are okay and that you'll always have debt and SHOULD always have debt, but Dave is right that you can live richer without debts and that's why most millionaires don't have debts. Dave really explains and break down all these myths about debt and money. He tackles the topics like leasing cars and the lack of logic behind it, and the benefits of paying off your mortgage rather than dragging it out just for the tax benefits. I read a Suze Orman book earlier this year and I think Dave Ramsey's is much better.	2005-10-10

This is an empirical IMF theory which was published after the author Stiglitz had shaped his career as a members of Council for Economic Advisors(1993-1997), the chief economist of World Bank(1997-2000), and the Nobel Economist(2001). <br /> <br /> His point is very clear. Seeing the reason for world wide discontent voices against Globalization since 1999 WTO Seattle conference, he found its reason for inconsistency of international economic organizations like IMF, WB, and WTO. Especially because of the rigidity of IMF ideological attitude which strongly pushes advancing nations to tight budget, privatization, and liberalization in its shock therapy. <br /> Citing various cases from East Asian(Japan, Korea, Thai, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Philippines) which faced crisis in 1998, Russia and China which end up to different consequences, Africa(Ethiopia, Botswana, Kenya, Morocco, and Coted'Ivoire), Europe(UK, French, Germany, Poland, Hungary, Ukraine, Czech, Sweden, and Rumania), and South America(Brazil, Argentine, and Bolivia) for persuading reader to see IMF error, he guess IMF rigidity could come from the protection of speculators by U.S. Treasury Department which favors Wall Street. <br /> What he offers from these empirical cases is a progressive globalization which accomplishes equality and economic growth simultaneously.  <br /> <br /> As he wrote in acknowledgement, because his main activity has been on academic papers and general speech and he was forced to reduce this original manuscript, we can not see thorough notes and enough arguments. However, as he done in the introduction, the aim of this book was to set up a trigger of discussion. I think he filled the role of his responsibility.	2005-10-10

I think they actually like and respect each other immensely but find it difficult to put aside their aloofness. Therefore, they play off each other with ascerbic wit and sarcasm and find this to be within their comfort zones.

I have read others' negative reviews of poorly written characters and a long-winded plot line, however, I have to disagree. It may be taking a long time to read this epic (I am in the seventh book with four more to go), but I'm having a great time traveling with these characters. Rand has a lot of work to do to get the world united against the Shadow, and witnessing his character development alone is fascinating. He might be taking on a bit of arrogance, but wouldn't you if you suddenly had that much power? I'm surprised he manages to be so down to earth! I think that most people, being the selfish creatures we are, would forget about facing the Dark One and just enjoy the lavish lifesyle. <br /> <br />The other negative remarks I have read refer to the authors' use of made-up words to describe things and people that fantasy readers are familiar with. I happen to think his language is brilliant, and the mark of a great writer. His ideas are as original as you can get in the fantasy genre, and the new words pull you into his world. I don't feel like I'm reading these books - I feel like I'm living inside the protaganist's head (whoever that happens to be at the moment - I especially like being inside Perrin's head, what with his special sense of smell). I mean, come on people! We don't even use all the same words as the British, and we've only been separated from them for a few hundred years. This story is set many thousands of years in the future, if you can read between the lines, or rather, interpret Jordan's language.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this series to anyone with a mature, intelligent mind.	2005-10-10

I have found that all of them, for ease of publishing and other things, are dumbed down a bit, which is irritating, but for the savvy pianist or computer downloader, you can figure it out. Scarlets walk is not unpleasant. Heavier piano tunes like \\"Wednesday,\\" \\"Virginia,\\" and \\"Gold Dust,\\" are great, but also some of my favorite songs on the piano are not really piano-oriented, like \\"a sorta fairytale,\\" which is mostly three chords throughout the piece. So be familiar with the album and which pieces you really like before you buy. Great for someone who knows all the words to the album, but for a strict piano composition, try \\"Under the Pink,\\" or \\"Little Earthquakes.\\"	2005-10-10

It is a wonderful new way to see some of the significant events of the civil war as seen from a horse's perspective. And what better horse than \\"Traveller\\".<br /><br />I will agree that it helps to have some knowledge of the comings and goings of the Army of Northern Virginia, or you will not have much idea of where you are and at what point during the war. Of course this is perfectly accurate as our horse narrator has no idea of place names. For those readers familiar with the Civil War, you will find yourself recognizing the events described by Traveller and come away with a unique perspective of these campaigns. Antietam and Wilderness will come quickly to the informed reader's mind as Traveller remembers the events of those dark days.<br /><br />This story is unabashedly told from a Southern perspective (not in a revisionist way as the opening editorial review suggests). It is after all told by a Southern Horse.<br /><br />Richard Adams will capture your imagination as you dwell at length on the relationship that a man and his horse shared during one of the most momentous times in our nation's history.<br /><br />After reading the book, take a road trip to Lexington, VA and to the chapel at Washington and Lee College. Outside the entrance you will find a grave stone covered with coins and carrots. There you will find Traveller.	2005-10-10

The book is an easy read and doesn't overwhelm the parent with too many steps as self-help books often do.<br /><br />The clear, direct, and humorous writing style allows parents with hectic lives to quickly read the book, absorb its concepts, and put them to use. Each chapter ends with reflection questions to reinforce the themes from the chapter. The book continues its effectiveness whether or not the reader answers the questions. However, thinking about the questions might shed light on you, your kids, and your relationships.<br /><br />The concept of parents not letting their emotions guide their response to a child's troubles is not new, but Runkel shares stories, experiences, and explanations on how to do it. Sure, junior spilling juice all over the carpet can make any parent mad, but dealing with the situation while maintaining control has better results than a scream fest, spanking, or arguing.<br /><br />Though the book focuses on parenting, its concepts largely address ourselves as individuals. For we have to take care of us first before others. Instead of permissive or dictatorship parenting, Runkel encourages judo parenting, which is \\"the art of going with another's momentum.\\" He shows how to do this by providing the answers to the questions all parents get like \\"I'm bored,\\" \\"Are we there yet?\\" and \\"I hate you!\\"<br /><br />Two nitpicks. First, there are a few religious references. I wish this had been omitted because religion is a hot issue and the book's concepts fly well without the religious quotes or references. Using these unnecessarily limits the book's reach as people who skim the book might get the impression it's only for Christian parents. It's not.<br /><br />The second is not an issue, but rather a want for more examples of using the ScreamFree approach. The stories in the book explain the concept very well and having more would enhance the book's usefulness.<br /><br />When I told my oldest about the book, she said parents who yell are teaching their kids to yell when they become adults. Deep and accurate insight, as we've seen many children grow up to pick up their parents' bad habits. Overwhelmed parents can begin with one step by picking one situation that pushes their buttons and applying the ScreamFree approach until they get the hang of it. Runkel doesn't pressure the reader and the concepts are doable.xplain the concept very well and having more would enhance the book's usefulness.<br /><br />When I told my oldest about the book, she said parents who yell are teaching their kids to yell when they become adults.

Farrell's book came out in 1972 was about the Sepoy Mutiny and a part of Indian History that is not well traced. Though there are versions of it, one wonders which is accurate. Thus it is an apt topic for a novel. He looks at it from various perspectives - the British, the Indians and the Princes. In bitter irony, he spares none and tears each of them. The book starts with mirth and gradually descends into darkness as the fight between the Indian soldiers and British intensifies. As is often traced in history, such darkness leads to reduction of ones senses and it is seen in the book. Though it only a novel, it captures all aspects of the story beautifully.  <br /> <br />It shows the collector as a ramrod person who sticks to his rules as a typical Britisher of the past. He has his positives and negatives and foresees the problem but is unable to cope with it. He thinks that he is bringing civilization to an uncivilized place and as the story unfolds, one wonders who is civilized. On a more concrete note, one understands the pros and cons of imperialism and how difficult it gets to justify it at times. Though the British were under the East India Company during this time, after this they moved under Royal Flag. That shows the extent of the impact this war created. This is one of most beautiful novels of that decade. Farrell travelled to India during the research for the novel and commented that he was more confused after seeing India than before. He was an eclectic author who wrote books like Singapore Grip, but this was his masterpiece. It is worth owning.	2005-10-10

It was a war that Sparta eventually won, although it was a short-lived victory as Spartan hegemony gave way to Theban dominance and ultimately to that of the Macedonians Phillip and Alexander.  <br /> <br />Military historians will find much to enjoy here. The account involves traditional battles with massed hoplites, amphibious landings, night battles, peltasts and light-armed troops, special forces ops, siege warfare, diplomacy, etc. The descriptions of the battles of Delium (Bk. 4) and Maninteas (Bk. 5) are particularly good on this score  <br /> <br />What caused the war? Thucydides points to the growing power of the Athenian Empire. Athens had emerged stronger after the Persian war. But it led to a policy of imperialism directed at other Greek states, which in turn caused geopolitical instability. In light of the growth of the Athenian empire, one could argue, war was practically inevitable. Imperial hubris was Athens's downfall, a danger to which not even modern superpowers are immune.  <br /> <br />A case in point. The disastrous Sicilian expedition undertaken by Athens was a direct factor in its downfall, and is disturbingly reminiscent of the overseas military ops of modern empires, especially the current crisis in Iraq. Incidentally, in Bk 4.58-65, the decision of the Sicilians to put aside their squabbles and unite against the invader, Athens, will be familiar to students of insurgency warfare.  <br /> <br />It is also curious to note the role that ethnicity played in the war, i.e. Ionian vs. Dorian, Greek vs. Barbarian, particularly since historians tell us that race & ethnicity were unimportant to the ancient Greeks.  <br /> <br />Should we be surprised that the events described by Thucydides seem to familiar to us? Not at all. History is the study of mankind. As Thucydides knew, human nature is a constant. As the Syracusan Hermocrates says to his fellow Sicilians prior to the Athenian invasion: \\"...although it is human nature everywhere to dominate those who gave way, it is also in our nature to defend ourselves against attack\\" (Bk 4.61). War is a part of human nature, and no amount of idealistic peace-keeping missions can change that. To help us understand why, there is no better historian than Thucydides.  <br />	2005-10-10

I read a book to my granddaughter, Aurora, yesterday...one a dear friend had sent me... i read it to her mainly because she had 1st grade homework which included reading time...since we had her with us, it was my pleasure to sit and read to her. We hadn't done it in awhile..and she used to love love love to have me read to her..now, being a big girl 6 she loves to do other things.  <br /> <br />The book is very sweet titled: \\"I Wanna Go to Grandma's House\\"  <br /> <br />The book goes along nicely sort of like a poem..rhyming words here and there.. real cute. The little girl in story is about Aurora's age and the grandma is 5 yrs older than i am...lol.  <br /> <br />Anywho, at a point in the book, the grandma talks of the granddaughter being an angel..and, in fact, at times she can see the lil girl's HALO. As i read this, Aurora stopped me and asked me what a halo was...as i explained it to her w/ motioning in circular pattern over her head she said:  <br />\\"You mean like the one i see around Nick's head?....\\" me: \\"you see one around Nick's head?\\" Aurora: \\"Yes, only it has a big rock on his head\\"...  <br /> <br />I let it go and later as we sat talking about something else i brought the subject up again as i was REALLY curious what she was talking about....(to say the least!)  <br /> <br />She explained to me in detail...that the halo around Nick's head had a beautiful rock on front of it and when she see's him (don't YOU see him grandma????!)...he's got it on his head..it's beautiful...and Nick always looks happy and is smiling at Aurora or waving at her. She went on to tell me she sometimes see's him in her dreams and they have fun and laugh and play...other times, she see's him in the daylight....:*)***....don't you, grandma????..... I told her no and she asked why.......i told her sometimes children can see things adults can't see and sometimes some adults can see them, too..but not always... no, i can't see him..i wish i could...  <br /> <br />You see, my son, Aurora's Uncle Nick, died in mid-August... I am forever grateful my friend, Rosemary, chose this book to send for us as we probably never would have had this conversation otherwise.  Of course, it is immensely comforting to me and a story I will never forget. Ever.	2005-10-10

This one is the worst I've read, and that encompasses quite a bit.  The author clearly demonstrates his ignorance of: weapons systems, wound ballistics, electronics, aerodynamics and aeronautics, physics, automotive engineering, human endurance, global politics and economics, physiology, and virtually every other subject he broaches.  I'm sure I left a few out, but I am trying to forget this book as quickly as possible.   <br /> <br />By far the worst sin Reilly commits as a writer is his misuse of the English language.  I had some hope that a writer would have been able to avoid the number of \\"had got\\" improprieties that were written into the book, but he didn't; neither did the editors or the publishers.  Then again, after all of the other bad writing, I guess that the grammar should have been expected.  <br /> <br />I can envision that this book could serve a good purpose as a bad example that should not be followed.  Certainly, don't spend your money on this book!  Get it from the library or better yet, you can have my copy.  I expect that it is worthless on the used book market.

What immediately struck me is that this book is not chopped into neat little portions that make the other Vonnegut books so easy to digest. Also, the chronology of the book follows a conventional time line of events that Vonnegut seems to avoid in his later books. Besides that, this is wild science fiction. America has been taken over by a computer and everyone has an employee rating based, predominately, on an IQ score. Engineers and executives rule the corporate world as most jobs have become automated. Engineers have become great by making other people's jobs obsolete. The corporate workers don't see what they are doing. For example, when one of the company's long-standing and self-important secretaries (with a Ph.D. - many people in this futuristic setting have been made to get PhDs) is told her job is not necessary because a computer can do it; she becomes upset and can't understand why anyone would tell her that her job wasn't necessary.<br /><br />This crazy culture is oddly observed by Shah of Bratpuhr who hails from an obscure but rich, unindustrialized society. The Shah prays and cajoles the computer to answers his riddles about the meaning of life, but it can't. The shah, despite admonishments by his tour guides, perceives all humans in the society to be \\"slaves.\\"<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is the Executive team building camp. Complete with adulterous affairs, roaring team anthems and silly adult competitiveness, the setting nails corporate suck-ups and purveyors of the corporate line. But watch out, the ghost shirt society is out to change it all!	2005-10-10

Sure, I knew the name, but was never interested enough to see one of his movies. Now, after reading Jimmy McDonough's \\"Big Bosoms and Square Jaws,\\" I don't think I have to: McDonough's biography tells me all I need to know.<br /><br />  I wasn't familiar with Jimmy McDonough either before picking up this book. Now I am. McDonough writes like the late Hunter S. Thompson on one his better days. The prose is intensely personal, highly driven, with the feel of a first-person memoir. I suspect that if Russ Meyer weren't an egocentric, self-centered guy who made movies with bare breasts when it was considered \\"dirty,\\" the book still would have been interesting. McDonough is that good.<br /><br />  I still have no great desire to see a Meyer film. But the guy's story as told by McDonough is interesting. McDonough doesn't get into film criticism as an effete sport. Rather he delivers his opinion of Meyer's work, buttressed by reviews. His interviews with survivors of relationships with Meyer crackle. He's done a marvelous job of weaving other people's recollections (always properly attributed) into the narrative.<br /><br />  Meyer coems across as a guy who pursued his dreams. Personally he seems to have been a large ego who really didn't care a whole lot for or about other people. There is literally a cast of thousands of supporting players who played a role in making Meyer whatever he became. The women he used as his \\"stars\\" are treated beautifully and sensitively by McDonough. Many, if not all, were strippers. It would have been easy to depict them as airheads. Much to McDonough's credit, he doesn't. He treats them as human beings.<br /><br />  Meyer never really failed. He determined on what he was going to (worship the female breast, essentially, and make movies) and did it. Meyer will never be a nominee for a Nobel Prize and its likely that his work will fade from memory over time. McDonough, however, does an excellent job of describing Meyer's technique, his contributions to filmaking and his not inconsiderable role in broadening the accpeptability of all manner of \\"artistic expression\\" in the United States.<br /><br />  McDonough is very understated in his description of Meyer's decline. It would have been easy, I think, to have allowed a sense of outrage to show, but much to McDonough's credit, he holds himself in.<br /><br />  Overall, even if you have little or no interest in Russ Meyer or his films, this biography is worth reading simply to gain a sense of Jimmy McDonough.<br /><br />Jerryellent job of describing Meyer's technique, his contributions to filmaking and his not inconsiderable role in broadening the accpeptability of all manner of \\"artistic expression\\" in the United States. <br /> <br />  McDonough is very understated in his description of Meyer's decline.

It particularlly addresses a woman's experience of the world, of herself, of her own body, and of the Divine Mystery that most works have only pointed toward. A functional blend of historical perspective and mystical apprehension, Lanzetta offers a humble and pristine glimpse that will serve to legitimize and elevate a woman's life as a distinct path to the holy Mystery. This work positions itself in the current-day struggles of all vulnerable beings, whether female, male, child, or nature, and finds voice and power in the  movement of everyday lives. Radical Wisdom is a ground-breaking, much needed work.	2005-10-10

Who will I be if I give it up?\\"  Jacobson sought out almost 300 Jewish holocaust survivors. Facing persecution and death, some had concealed their Jewishness, some embraced it, some only discovered it when it was thrust upon them by the Nazis.<br /><br />From tape-recorded interviews Jacobson chose 15 life stories and organized them into five categories, the three already mentioned and two more - those of mixed origin whose non-Jewish side protected them from some persecution, and young children whose Jewish identity was concealed from them during the war.<br /><br />For those who concealed their Jewishness, the issue was straightforward. Romulus Berliner, a Transylvanian, joined the SS when the opportunity presented itself after his escape from a forced-labor camp. He never forgot who he was although he tried. \\"You have to switch yourself off,\\" he said, believing that Germany would win the war and \\"Jewry will no longer exist.\\" He imagined a life in hiding, deep in Russia, where he wouldn't be \\"taken prisoner for not being who I was supposed to be.\\" When it became clear Germany would lose, he cast off his assumed identity and \\"out of joy\\" proclaimed his Jewishness to the officer he served - who got up and never spoke to him again.<br /><br />Hilda Dujardin, half-Jewish, married to an Aryan, joined the Jewish community when it became dangerous to do so. She ended up in a concentration camp but her account is full of the small acts of bravery and compassion committed by people around her and her own sometimes irrational acts of defiance - refusing to vacate the path of an SS horseman, for instance - which led to condemnation from frightened Jews who hoped to stay alive by attracting no notice.<br /><br />The young experienced the most confusion. Ariel Levy's mother was arrested in 1942 when he was 8 years old. \\"When she disappeared I somehow knew: 'I'm in the nightmare.' \\" He spent the war shunted from family to family and joined a Hitler youth group. \\"I had to become something else completely and to repress that part of me which was Jewish so deeply that I wouldn't be bothered all the time thinking about the duality....When you are in the nightmare, you are no longer troubled by things changing.\\" After the war he went \\"to save Israel,\\" but was soon disillusioned by the hard work and the rigid system, though he kept the Hebraicized version of his name.<br /><br />Jacobson's focus on identity offers a different perspective, but however intellectual the approach, sheer survival becomes the riveting force in any holocaust account. Luck, the occasional act of bravery or craven betrayal capture the reader's attention more completely than any questions of identity.d joined a Hitler youth group. \\"I had to become something else completely and to repress that part of me which was Jewish so deeply that I wouldn't be bothered all the time thinking about the duality....When you are in the nightmare, you are no longer troubled by things changing.\\" After the war he went \\"to save Israel,\\" but was soon disillusioned by the hard work and the rigid system, though he kept the Hebraicized version of his name. <br /> <br />Jacobson's focus on identity offers a different perspective, but however intellectual the approach, sheer survival becomes the riveting force in any holocaust account.

In the bands that split away from the beaten forces, she ran for awhile with a pack that included a gifted gunslinger named Gwynn.<br /><br />They meet again by chance in the arid deserts of Copper Country, both lone wanderers fleeing from the great General Anforth and searching for a place to belong.  Together, they are able to make their way up onto the Teleute Shelf, to the city of Ashamoil.  A rich city built on terraces over a bustling river, surrounded by fecund jungles and swamp-like flats.  Ashamoil is a city of wonders, of deeply imbedded cultures, and magical affairs.<br /><br />Raule finds herself unable to obtain high employment, lacking the required social attachments to accredited colleges, and therefore takes up employment as a doctor in the seedy parish hospital in the Limewood district.  Gwynn, on the other hand, being a skilled assassin and resembling a Renaissance man, obtains a high position in the Society of the Horn Fan, a mafia-type organization which controls the slave trade.<br /><br />Raule disapproves of Gwynn's position, and turns her back on him.  Gwynn imbeds himself deeply into the Society, fitting to it like a sleek black glove on a long fingered hand.  By chance he meets a strange artist, Beth, with whom he strikes up a semblance of affection.  The days are high for Gwynn, and low for Raule, who entertains herself by collecting malformed and warped fetuses in jars.<br /><br />'The Etched City' is one of the greatest fantasies I have ever read.  Reminiscent of Mieville's 'Perdido Street Station', VanderMeer's 'City of Saints And Madmen', Gerard Daniel Houarner's 'Black Orchids From Aum', and Jeffrey Thomas's 'Punktown', K.J. Bishop has created a world so surrealistically beautiful and yet so sordidly vile that I can't wait for her to write another book of Ashamoil.<br /><br />Her characters are fully fleshed, even though some completely lack in any emotion, her use of prose is riveting and yet smooth, and her imagination vividly wonderful.  'The Etched City' is a dark fantasy, finding this treat was like finding a rich, overripe plum hanging heavy from a decaying branch, one that I could not resist plucking and biting into, to taste the heavy, sweetly fetid syrup it offered up to me.  Never knowing if the next bite would be sweet, sour, or putrid, I was unable to stop myself from finishing it's corrupt succulence.<br /><br />I would rate `Etched City' a ten star book, and I definitely recommend that you give it a read.  If I had one problem with it, it would be that I would have liked to see a little more of Raule, but Gwynn is obviously the more flamboyant of the two protagonists.

Boy was I ever wrong as I couldn't put it down once I started reading it! Allen St. John has written a very entertaining & interesting book about a master luthier/guitar virtuoso named Wayne Henderson of Rugby, Virginia, Population 7. It is a true story about Eric Clapton discovering one of Mr. Henderson's guitars at a studio and being so impressed he wants to get one, the only trouble being that it takes up to ten years to receive it. Mr. St. John tells us in a delightful & entertaining way the story behind Clapton's guitar & what it took to make it. You will learn about Wayne Henderson and the cast of characters that hang out at his guitar shop who not only want one of his guitars, but just want to see an \\"old world craftsman\\" perform his trade. Along the way you learn about Mr. Henderson, his family, friends, and the small town of Rugby, Virginia through the eyes of Mr. St. John as he aides Mr. Clapton's quest for a Henderson guitar as well as his own desire to own one. Mr. St. John's writing style is easy going with a blend of first hand accounts and little side stories along the way that keep your interest. He has a way of making you feel like you are there with him in rural Rugby, Virginia watching, assisting, and encouraging Mr. Henderson to make Clapton's guitar and becoming his friend along the way. This book has something for everyone from guitar afficianados to people who just like a good story. Buy it and you won't be sorry you did.	2005-10-10

A graphic designer without any children's book credentials to his name, creates an alphabet book in 1996 that (in his own words), \\"had to retain the natural shape of the letter as well as represent the meaning of the word\\", by using good design.  So he produces the book, it wins the incredibly prestigious Caldecott Honor, and Pelletier never makes another children's book again.  Now, creating kids' books is an addictive activity.  You may start out with the best intentions in the world and you may tell yourself, \\"I'll just do this one book to get it out of my system\\".  But after that first book garners some attention you find yourself making another and another and another.  It would have made all the sense in the world for Pelletier to  follow up his award winning book with one about, oh say, numbers.  Yet as of this review (written in that overblown year of 2005) this particular graphic designer hasn't been any more tempted to return to the heady world of kiddie lit.  Instead, he leaves us with this peculiar alphabet book that is perfect for adults who love design but probably downright bizarre to those children who are trying to learn their a, b, c's.<br /><br />In this book, Pelletier takes each letter of the alphabet and displays it with a word starting with that letter.  For example, A is given the word Avalanche.  Looking at the letter, you see a gigantic letter A (the one on the cover) with pieces of it breaking off and falling into an abyss.  For the letter N we see noodles filling a page, all looking like little lowercase N's.  Get the idea?  Good, because it gets a little obscure sometimes.  For example, this being a book of good design, L is of course going to stand for Lines.  Two 90 degree angles made up of thin lines mirror one another.  In pictures such as this, kids are going to have to already know their letters to discover where they're hidden on the pages.  Fortunately, Pelletier gives them a heads up right from the start.  His B, standing for Bounce, looks more like a softened M than a B on its side.  And it definitely takes some squinting and frowns to make the R for Rip look like much more than a gash in a page.<br /><br />Certain picture books are designed with adults in mind.  There should be an entire genre of to-be-read-only-by-adults alphabet books out there.  None of this is to say that the book isn't lovely.  The visual pleasure that comes from the complimentary strands of color in Knot or the skeletal crossing of the fingers in X-ray are lovely.  As a book who's pictures are done entirely on a computer, however, this hardly deserved to win an award for great illustration.  It's pleasing to the eye but from reviews already written about this book, its best for kids ages 10 and up.  And therefore useless as an alphabet book.<br /><br />Admittedly, \\"The Graphic Alphabet\\" is probably directly responsible for some of the more original alphabet books out there.  Things like, \\"The Hidden Alphabet\\" by Laura Vaccaro Seeger, \\"The Turn Around Upside Down Alphabet Book\\" by Lisa Campbell Ernst, or even Stephen T. Johnson's, \\"Alphabet City\\".  Unlike these, however, \\"The Graphic Alphabet\\" is an example of useless design.  This is design as art, not as something utilitarian (like actually learning the alphabet).  I'm sure Mr. Pelletier has many sterling qualities and the book is a lovely thing to look at, no question.  But if you're buying it for a kid, give it to one already enrolled in a class that looks at the influences of Le Corbusier and Mondrian. Better still, pair it with Mark Gonyea's, \\"A Book About Design\\" for kids.  This is a great resource but only if used in the correct way.art.

So, as a previous reviewer has stated, you sometimes will revisit a topic from a different author's perspective.  That said, I really enjoyed this book.  I began using hand planes about a year ago and had mixed results.  After reading 'Working with Handplanes' I had a better sense of my planes and their use.  I took the advice and \\"tuned-up\\" a new plane that I was fairly happy with.  The result was a plane that performed substantially better. <br /> <br />It seems that for most woodworkers the use of handplanes is a lost art.  That's too bad because planes have been around for centuries and are still around simply because they work well.  If you're interested in using planes I highly recommend this book as a starting point to have your plane work as it should.	2005-10-10

The next day, the local sheriff's deputies are looking for Reacher.  Quickly escaping out a motel window, Reacher needs a ride quick.  He's astonished with an attractive younger woman quickly picks him up.  He's even more astonished by what she wants him to do.<br /><br />With Echo Burning, Reacher becomes a more physically talented version of the Fugitive who helps those into whose path he stumbles.  While some see Reacher as Spenser, I don't think so except for the desire to right wrongs.<br /><br />The story has the usual episodes where Reacher takes on the tough guys and leaves them bleeding, shows his skill with guns and figures out difficult puzzles by putting himself in the shoes of the bad guys.<br /><br />Of the other characters, two stand out for improving the story . . . resourceful young Ellie Greer and anti-Texan Alice Amanda Aaron, a defense attorney.<br /><br />The book's main weakness is that it presumes a level of corrupt legal practices beyond what anyone could actually pull off.  Think of this as a fairy tale in that sense, over drawn to make the corrupt seem even more despicable.<br /><br />But if you've liked any of the Reacher novels, you'll enjoy this one.  Add it to your list.	2005-10-10

US	49836087	R1SMR0WPFSSXEE	0812568966	823350665	Charisma	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A very satisfying multi-genre thriller	Those who only know Barnes through his collaborations with hard sci-fi master Larry Niven should be pleasantly surprised by this genre-esque novel about a group of highly intelligent and amazingly motivated children from small-town, USA.  There are elements of horror, romance, mystery, western, and yes, even a touch of sci-fi, but the result is none of the above, but rather a basically mainstream story about what makes successful people tick.<br /><br />Although one may question the characters' motivations, and there's at least one scientific point that seems like quite a stretch, there's no denying the power of this engrossing mystery.  The kids tend to steal the spotlight, of course, especially when we see how they play the system and manipulate the adult world as they see fit.  Renny Sand is the inquisitive reporter who covered an infamous scandal that shook the town years earlier.  He returns now, after some reversals, driven by his desire for Vivian, the beautiful mother of one of the boys.  And while Sand is a pleasant and engaging enough character, he ultimately doesn't seem to have much to do in this novel.  We think he's being set up as the hero of this tale, but when all's said and done, it's really the gun-slingin' grandma who saves the day, and the sections featuring her and her husband seem slow and largely irrelevant until the climax where all the pieces come together.  Barnes probably should have dropped these two altogether and made Sands the hero.<br /><br />That quibble aside however, this book is a serious page-turner, with mysteries at every turn: the Aristotle project, the pre-school scandal, Sheriff D'Angelo's secret, and the late great Alexander Marcus' weakness, are all explained in good time, but not so quickly that we lose interest in the story before it's been played out.  A very entertaining and altogether satisfying read, but not yet the masterpiece we're hoping for from Barnes.	2005-10-10

Many fine books have been written in the last 10 years regarding the treatment of pain. This, in my opinion, is not one of them. The depth of this text leaves much to be desired. No new approaches or considerations are highlighted either. For a single volume overview, I'd pick Rachlin & Rachlin's 2nd edition of Myofascial Pain and Fibromyalgia: Trigger Point Management over Baldry's by far. CC Gunn's The Gunn Approach to the Treatment of Chronic Pain: Intramuscular Stimulation for Myofascial Pain of Radiculopathic Origin and Wong's Manual of Neuro-Anatomical Acupuncture: Vol. 1: Musculo-Skeletal Disorders add some new dimensions to the treatment of stubborn myofascial pain syndromes with acupuncture. Of course, for trigger points, all you need is already presented in Travell & Simons' 2 volume classic. The needling techniques can be easily adapted to dry needling with acupuncture needles. Trigger point treatment strategies are well addressed in Clinical Mastery in the Treatment of Myofascial Pain by Ferguson and Gerwin and Chaitow & DeLaney's 2 volume Clinical Application of Neuromuscular Techniques.	2005-10-10

Others have argued with such statements, and offered grand compliments to the entirety of Donnerjack. <br /> <br />Allow me to underline the sentiments of the first and blink oddly at the latter in honest confusion. <br /> <br />The first third of Donnerjack is a work of art. Not only to fans of Zelazny, which I do not really count myself as. Not only to science-fiction fans, or fantasy fans. It is a true mythological tale which is so rarely seen in any genre. Death seems to spring from the page. John D'Arcy is seared into our minds. Virtu itself seems to spring up around us.  <br /> <br />It's astounding. It is one the better books in this decade. <br /> <br />And then, as you go along, your mouth gaping with unshamed awe, the author dies. <br /> <br />And so does the grand story, its porportions, its characters, and its quiet grace.  <br /> <br />It is replaced with something that at times seemed to be a childrens' book, a bodice-ripper, and a book based on a D&D session.  <br /> <br />I tried to go on. I honestly did. Having devoured the first part in a day, I continued slogging on for literally weeks. I dismissed obvious inconsistencies. I skimmed over plot holes. I even laughingly skipped over the multiple, multiple, multiple times the characters acted with simple childish /idiocy/. <br /> <br />And then I stopped, somewhere fifty pages from the end. Because I could not bear to go on. Donnerjack had died, a hundred and fifty pages ago. What was left wasn't worth the torture. <br /> <br />Donnerjack is amazing. It is an astounding story, astoundingly written, striking somewhere deep within the collective unconcious. But it only runs for 186 pages before it turns into something debasing and crude, and something inside you breaks at that loss. <br /> <br />I've never written a amazon.com review before, and I doubt I will again. But I had to write this one. <br /> <br />Donnerjack is amazing. Don't ever read it. You'll cry a little.	2005-10-10

I teach an intro course in PDE regularly and, although I don't use this as the main textbook, it is required reading for the course. Given its approach, its mathematical rigor is not quite right for the course that I teach, and it could use more interesting exercises. That said, it is indispensable for its physical and visual insights. It's brief and to-the-point and a cursory reading gives a wonderful introduction to the various topics and ideas of PDEs. The book is well written, and the informal writing matches the approach. And - the price is right!	2005-10-10

Whenever Wolfe leaves the office, bad things are bound to happen, but having to go to a fashion designer's workplace, albeit at the request of some of NY's top orchid growers, to investigate a murder, makes Wolfe more than a little grumpy and things go from bad to worse.  As this is an early Wolfe mystery fans will find a few things not in line with the later more polished work; Archie lacks the sophistication we see later in the series and there is particularly unfortunate episode of police brutality that accepted as par for the course by all parties involved. But it is a good mystery with a few more twists than some of the more formulaic Wolfe stories. <br />	2005-10-10

While reading the book I felt like suggesting that the author find a good editor to clean up the uneven, choppy, and repetitious writing here. She uses the word \\"nowadays\\" all too often, I even found it in a passage which is attributed to a person who wrote into her column in The Atlantic Monthly. I could get out one of my old writing books and give specific examples of the areas that are in need of a tune up, but I do not wish to put that much time into this review, nor do I think that this is what this forum is meant for. And I do not relish giving a bad review, the author seems to be well intentioned and probably a good and productive person, but this is more the reason I felt the need to add my two cents.  <br />I came here to Amazon's review forum to find out if anyone else felt the same way I did, and was amazed that so many well educated readers found the book so good. This is quite disturbing. I now doubt that well educated readers are able to discern between good and bad writing. It also makes me wonder if the reviews are from friends, many of them sounded so similar. The ideas are refreshing, but presentation could use one or two more rounds with a good, or perhaps different, editor.	2005-10-10

His conversion became pretty big news within my community because of the fact that he was a Catholic Priest from the east coast who became converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints after researching material to write an anti-Mormon book.  I actually had the opportunity to attend a meeting where he rehearsed his conversion story, and even had enough forethought to ask Deseret Book, an LDS publishing company, to record his talk to be sold in-stores (why not turn a profit on both sides of the religious debate since you are already a turncoat anyway?).  I had the opportunity to meet Isaiah, and he was very charismatic.   <br /> <br />During this talk he unequivocally denied the veracity of Catholicism, and embraced the doctrine and culture of the LDS faith.  His talk came out on tape and everybody in the area bought it (my friend actually bought mulitple copies and gave me one, which I still have for comic relief).  Two years later, after being a fully active Mormon, he left the church.  Not surprisingly, he then came out with a series of anti-Mormon books.   <br /> <br />One point of interest is that during his talk he said he started investigating Mormonism to find better anti-Mormon fodder, since most comments or supposed dogmas have been recycled by these types of writers, often for more than a century.  <br /> <br />There is no doubt that his entire foray into Mormonism was to try to leverage some credibility, which he has clearly done since all of his books since that time point out that he is a Mormon-turned-Catholic (they often leave out the fact that he was originally a Catholic).  This man is all-for-profit, and his claims of Mormonism in this book and others are still just the same old recycled trash that has been promulgated over the years.   <br /> <br />Take a pass on this and read something that actually makes people more Christlike.  Try not to make Isaiah's wallet too thick, as plenty of Mormons and Catholics alike have already done so.	2005-10-10

This is the single best book that I have found for self-study for non-native speakers. In fact, it is not only useful for graduate students, but for anyone who looks to improve their formal language skills, for professional purposes such as report-writing.<br /><br />It includes many useful exercises, covering details and nuances of the English language. The sample materials are interesting and engaging. It has sections on all the important aspects and comprehensively covers the subject, including formal grammar and style, data commentary, writing summaries & critiques and ends with two chapters that guide readers through constructing their own research paper.<br /><br />The authors share some of the writing that their students have done, which also supports the learning process, as you consider what works, and what doesn't. I haven't seen the 2004, second edition, so I cannot compare.<br /><br />If, as a non-native speaker you are looking for a great book to work with, this is what you need. The same is true if you teach non-native students to write academically. I recommend inquiring, if you buy secondhand, what state the book is in, because if the exercises have been filled out already, it will detract from the value.	2005-10-10

This small, very pretty, and interesting book in the sense that it has a lot to say in a short period of text (as if text had time in it), is certainly something to meditate on and think about. Just about a few days reading, Rowan Williams has managed to meditate and so interpret in a theological way, these icons: The Transfiguration, The Resurrection, Christ as one of the eternal Trinity, Christ as judge of the world and ruler of all.<br /><br />When I say that this book by its text seems to be about time, I mean in a way that is stretched, that this book takes imagination and thought to follow, expresses some deep beliefs and some insightful ways of becoming more with the spirit of Jesus Christ, and of gaining inspiration to go on with a life in the spirit. That is a mouthful. But afterall, if you are looking for a how-to book, this is not really it--though appreciation and the way of entering into the spirit and substance of the icons is there.<br /><br />The book did begin as a series of meditations, so there it is also valuable to some who are of a more religious bent since it is by a religious man, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Here is one way we are led to a more inspired way of worship and living in the spirit: \\"Looking at Jesus seriously changes things; if we do not want to be changed, it is better not to look hard or too long. The apostles in the icon are shielding their eyes, because what they see is not easily manageable in their existing world.\\" From the icon \\"Transfiguration\\" about the transfiguration, a depiction.<br /><br />For repeating myself, this pretty book makes a nice gift. I have given in to a friend who is a minister, and he said he and his wife enjoyed the small book, that it is a keeper. There is a good recommendation for it. How nice to have someone receive a gift and like it very much, to want to keep it. So this is a satisfying book one can go back to and read, and also look at the icons.<br /><br />Rowan Williams is a thinking mind, a very good theologian (so his reputation admits), and something of an intellectual (kind of a mild kudo for one of so fine a mind). This is an easy way to enter into his writings, and to enjoy his thoughts. If one wants to have a thoughtful book that reflects on the Trinity and also that wonderful icon of three angels called \\"The Hospitality of Abraham\\" by Rubrev, and so on some other key biblical themes in the Christian faith, this is a good place to enjoy such things.<br /><br />\\"While we can accept all the proper cautions about not treating the figures as simle depictions of the trinitarian persons, there is certainly a convention which understands that the icon is to be 'read' from left to right pointing to the father, the son and the spirit...\\" My reason for using this quote is to give the reader of this review a taste of the tone of the book. There is something consistently civil and formed about the tone of the book that is part of the hallmark of style about which the book is extant. I say \\"extant\\" because there is a spirit about the book that is partially the product of the tone, and the presence that is brought to bear by the writer and the designers of this gift book. That is something that people who like writing and to read will find both enjoyable and interesting about this title.<br /><br />No doubt about it, the writer Archbishop Rowan Williams is a man of faith who has the gospel in mind, and can be relied on to bring some of the many dimensions of Christ and his light to a reader. Here he speaks of Christ: \\"In all these meditations on icons of Christ, we find outselves looking at far more than just the representation of human beings of long ago. We are brought into the presence of one who contains everything, who makes everything hang together, who gives us the power to see all things freshly.\\" It is an impressive thing when someone who is sincere and a believer can make his beliefs come to life and meaning to others who are not so advanced in theirspiritual lives as he.<br /><br />The author has managed to write a series of meditations on icons, four of them, and to let the reader know about this God (Trinitarian) who acts in history both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament. A small, pretty book, this title makes a good gift for a religious or Church going friend who has an interest in art or finding ways to enter into the spirit through other dimensions, including the appreciation of icons, especially.<br /><br />--Peter Menkin, Obl Cam OSB (Mill Valley, CA USA)naged to write a series of meditations on icons, four of them, and to let the reader know about this God (Trinitarian) who acts in history both in the Old Testament and in the New Testament.

The situation for each letter is as follows \\"(Letter) is for (name) but who is chasing him/her?\\" The animal's name begins with the same letter. It is possible to be \\"chased by\\" an animal and not be in abject terror. It's all in how the parent presents the situation to the child. If you read the book in a way that makes it seem Sita is afraid of the Snake, it's your interpretation. If you make it light and funny that Ruben is chased by a Rabbit, that's how your child will take it. At the end \\"Zoe\\" and her \\"Zebra\\" seem to chase off all the \\"scary\\" animals anyway. It's no more frightening than your average Disney movie (in fact, it's much less). <br /> <br />Don't let the idea that \\"chased by\\" is \\"scary\\" keep you from enjoying this book with your child. The applique and embroidery work is exceptional and makes this book different from any other children's book I've seen. The colors are bright and each illustration is different. As other reviewers have said, the names and skin tones of the children are cross-cultural and the animals are diverse as well (not your usual menagerie). <br /> <br />The book is also well-constructed and large for a board book. It's easy for toddlers' hands to manipulate and the pages are large, allowing for enjoyment of the details even by the tiniest infant.

Don't be misled by the title - this book is NOT a diatribe by Arabs against Christians - the author of the book is an Arab Lebanese Christian so this should pacify any fears about a strong \\"Arab bias\\" in the book. <br /> <br />The book however is definitely through the \\"Arab eyes\\" in that the action, drama and political manouvering are explained from the seats of Arabs those days. The home turf of the crusaders is not covered in detail, e.g., the famous leader like Richard the Lionheart is given about 25 pages of coverage in the book and only when he enters present day Israel. So don't expect details about the in-depth politics of main-land europe. The coverage given to European politics is given in broad strokes, in major colors and without indepth detail. What the author has mentioned however is accurate. <br /> <br />If you want to learn something, open your eyes to the significant events that took place hundreds of years ago and be entertained in the process - there is no book better than this on the market! A definite 5 star recommendation.	2005-10-10

Ninety-seven handy suggestions to improve the quality of your best friend's life with fun and games and the occasional good-spirited prank.<br /><br />My mom has this book and her kind-natured, if slightly dim three-year-old Chessie-Collie mix, Fergus, loves some of the suggestions in here. One of the ones I've tried with him is number eighty-two: slingshooting treats for him to catch using a plastic spoon as a catapult. Another one that seems particularly enjoyed is number eighteen: juggling. I've always been a good juggler and when I juggle things Fergus wants, like a trio of rolled-up socks or tennis balls, he goes NUTZ trying to leap up and get what I'm keeping right out of his reach. It's a hoot.<br /><br />The one suggestion that really tripped me out, though, and had me laughing was number thirty-two: \\"The Three Little Bears routine\\" which involves sneaking into your pet's bed and letting him catch you there for a change. Ha!!! Haven't tried that one yet but maybe I will when the time is right. Justice for all the times he's sneaked up onto Mom's furniture and stuff.<br /><br />This cheerful little book is great not only for the ideas it gives you but for its ninety-seven pages of smiling, happy doggies!	2005-10-10

Waugh is famous for his scathing satire and witty play with words; he can craft characters who are odious even to him and dispose of their problems with ease and brillance.  Such is the case with \\"The Loved One\\", a wry novel that skewers everything from the upper class to religion to funerary practices, all while drawing laughs and smiles from the reader.<br /><br />Dennis Barlow is a young Englishman living in southern California.  He fashions himself to be a poet, but as the Muse has left him dry, he finds employment at the Happier Hunting Grounds a.k.a. the local pet cemetery.  When his mentor and roommate commits suicide, it is up to Dennis to arrange his funeral at the chic and studied Whispering Glades - not so much a cemetery as an entire business devoted to the dead and their 'waiting ones'.  Dennis finds himself enthralled with not only Whispering Glades, but with Aimee, a young cosmetician who works there.  He fights for her attention with plagarized poems while her other suitor, Mr. Joyboy the wonder mortician, delivers smiling corpse after corpse for her to paint in hopes of winning her love.<br /><br />After introducing readers to this integral triangle of the book, the novel is then devoted to Aimee's struggles to choose which man she should marry.  This questioning leads to some fatal consequences, that are indecorously disposed of through Waugh's irreverent creation Dennis Barlow.  \\"The Loved One\\" is tirelessly funny, and searchingly honest.  Evelyn Waugh examines the farce humans play when a loved one dies with heretofore unknown wit and alacrity that may have failed under lesser hands.	2005-10-10

With the upturn in the economy Stephanie decides to seek alternative employment, first at the button factory, then the drycleaners, and Cluck in a Bucket is next, before Ranger offers her employment with Rangeman Enterprises. As is usual with Stephanie nothing goes smooth, and besides she's bored being deskbound, so inevitably her usual curiosity is aroused to start snooping into dangerous situations. Lula takes over her role as bounty hunter, however is constantly relying on Stephanie for backup so the rolling in garbage and having food thrown over her continues. The sexual tension between Stephanie and the two male protagonists Morelli and Ranger is still on, with the relationship with Ranger being built on in this novel. Stephanie gives up sugar, which has an interesting impact on her libido.  Despite giving up being a bounty hunter Stephanie again finds herself stalked by a psycho, only this time its someone back from the dead. Among the mayhem of Stephanie's professional life, Sally Sweet is back planning Valerie's and Kloughn's wedding, and  Stephanie is to play cello at the wedding.  This novel along with the other Stephanie Plum novels, is a mixture of comedy and crime fiction, and supports the usual cast of zany characters that the reader has come to love. Fans of the Stephanie Plum novels won't be disappointed with Janet Evanovich's latest offering as it is a delightfully enjoyable romp through the disasters that only happen to Stephanie. An entertaining read that existing fans will devour and new readers will enjoy the mayhem and humour that is synonymous with this series.	2005-10-10

This is the third book I have read by this author and I have enjoyed all of them although this one has a lot more plot twists and turns.<br /><br />The main character, Jane Killian, is fifteen and cutting school when on a dare from her older half-sister and her friends goes for a swim in March 1987 in a lake in Dallas, Texas.  The water is frigid but Jane is exhilarated feeling that her sister Stacy and her friends will respect her now and not think her a bookworm or weakling. Jane even swims out past the swimmer's buoy to the boating side and sees a motor boat coming which first seems to turn away from her and then swerves and comes right at her.  She is hit by the propeller.<br /><br />We come forward to October 2003 and Jane has fallen asleep at her computer in her Dallas studio reliving that nightmare.  She wakes up to find her husband, Dr. Ian Westbrook, standing in the doorway to her studio asking if she is okay.  We find out that she has had extensive plastic and reconstructive surgery so that in spite of a fine scar along her jaw line and a glass eye in place of the one torn out by the accident, she is \\"beautiful.\\"  Her husband is also very handsome and they seem to be much in love.  Jane has just found out that she is eight weeks pregnant.  Jane is also an up and coming artist called \\"Cameo\\" who does sculptures and videos of women talking about fears, insecurities and so on.<br /><br />A former patient of Ian's is found dead in a hotel room.  Jane's sister Stacy, now a homicide detective with the Dallas PD is called to the scene with her new partner, Mac McPherson.  Evidence is uncovered that lead them to suspect Jane's husband, Ian, may have been having an affair with her and killed her.  They begin questioning witnesses and soon too Ian's office manager, Marsha, turns up dead as well.  Jane and Stacy's good friend and psychologist, Dave Nash, talks to Jane and tries to help her with her nightmares and suspicions.  Soon Ian is arrested, more bodies start popping up and more characters and suspects enter the story.<br /><br />While I found some of the police and forensic descriptions to be not as good as some mysteries, the plot did have great twists and turns as even the reader did not know who was behind it all until the end.  An exciting read!	2005-10-10

I would disagree with those who have said that Maddalena is not a likable character. True, she is not particularly \\"empowered\\" in the modern sense, and she has her flaws, but she is a product of her time and culture. I couldn't help sympathizing with her. So often literary heroines are exceptional or ahead of their time in some way, and while this is certainly interesting, it's rather refreshing to read about the interior life and feelings of a \\"normal\\" person -- and something which takes a bit more courage and empathy on the author's part, I think.  <br /> <br />My only niggles with the book: some historical innacuracies, which stood out because most of the book seemed so well-researched. For example, pantyhose (mentioned when Maddalena goes to the talent agent) weren't invented until 1959, and Magic Markers (also mentioned in that scene) weren't around by that name, anyway, until the mid sixties. <br /> <br />I also wished that there was a bit more conflict and tension to the plot. While I finished and enjoyed the book, and found the writing clear and sensitive, the book as a whole was very quiet, and didn't have that wonderful page-turning quality I crave. Still, it's clear that the author has a lot of promise. I look forward to reading his future books. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

I missed out on biology in high school and was very ignorant on the subject.  Reading this book gave me energy and invigorated my interest to go back to school.  I studied biology and got an A. Thank you Richard Dawkins.  If I had read this book in the late seventies I could have saved myself some time. The book uses genes as a metaphor:  genes use us to purpetuate themselves.  This view gives insight into biological determinism.  Of course we aren't blindly driven by genes but the idea is very thought provoking.  I use to think that the \\"Will\\"  determined our destiny.  I learned this as an English major by reading Pound and Nietsche.  Genes are a much more provable and sensible explaination of our actions.  I am skeptical about the concept of memes though which Dawkins introduces, the idea that cultural units of information we create go on to replicate themselves and influence us. This sounds like \\"Blank Slate\\" philosophy, see Pinker \\"The Blank Slate\\".<br />There is little discussion of the adaptability of the mind in this book.  Genes perpetuation is just the tip of an iceburg.	2005-10-10

However, myself and many other pastors I know have been surprised to see how much influence this book has had in our nation.  It has touched a deeper need than we recognized.  For that alone I am grateful to Rick for writing this book.<br /><br />Many people have had their lives changed by this book.<br /><br />Like his book, Purpose Driven Church, this book follows a very practical approach that will help you remember what he says and apply it to your life.<br /><br />There are fair criticisms of the book.  One of them that I've read is that there is nothing in the bible to teach us that forty days are required for us to get a grip on the purpose of our lives. It's probably not biblical to try to make 40 days a spiritual sounding time frame...it's just a good idea and it matches the time Jesus spent in the wilderness.  Really that is not a big deal though...and so I wouldn't knock the books rating because of a little thing like that.<br /><br />He confronts people with the true purpose for your existence...which flows straight from the revelation of the bible. It's powerful. It's true and you will be changed by this book if you read it with an open heart and mind.  I wouldn't let the current news events sway me to the right or the left on this book.  It's truths are timeless truths that you can use today or in ten years.  For that reason alone it's worth owning a copy.<br /><br />When you weigh the fact that so many lives are being transformed by this book, I have to give it a five star rating.<br /><br />On top of that, thousands of pastors are using Rick's stuff because he has wonderfully ministered to pastors all over the world for a long time now.  And he has impacted my life through his sermon training series called \\"Preaching for Life Change\\" and through his book \\"Purpose Driven Church\\".  So it's no wonder that pastors all over the world use and recommend this book.<br /><br />If you have not read it, I would like to invite you to obtain a copy as soon as possible and read it prayerfully!ecommend this book.      If you have not read it, I would like to invite you to obtain a copy as soon as possible and read it prayerfully!	2005-10-10

(I guess my loss of interest says more about me than the subject matter.)  I took just under 6 months to read this book, ponder its meaning, and research scriptural and other sources to see if it is correct in its teachings.  And after spending a lifetime as a follower and admirer of the carpenter from Nazareth who is the Son of God, I can only say that this book did more for my understanding of the doctrine of the Atonement than any other book short of scripture.<br /><br />The writing is clear and concise.  The author has obviously distilled the study of a lifetime into this volume because it carries quotes from so many disparate sources that would have taken years to accumulate.  From his background as a lawyer, the author is uniquely qualified to discuss justice, mercy and other related concepts.  His main sources are scriptures - that is the Bible and also scriptures unique to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon).  C.S. Lewis and Joseph Smith are also two common sources.<br /><br />The 300 pages of this book contain chapters on why an atonement is needed, what is the nature of the atonement, what it means, and how it was accomplished.  The atonement is the central doctrine of Christianity and is so comprehensive and overwhelming in its scope that a guide such as this one is extrememly useful.<br /><br />And besides the high intellectual content of this work, I found myself pondering over and over again the particularized question, \\"Considering what a failure I am, how is it possible that a Savior could care enough for me to suffer and die for me?\\"<br /><br />I recommend this book highly to anyone.	2005-10-10

(...)    (1)Nonce means 'for the present time' or 'for a single occasion or purpose', although the word is not often found in general use. A dictionary may note nonce words, those for which there is only a single textual instance.   (2)In security engineering, a nonce is a 'number used once'. It is often a random or pseudo-random number issued in an authentication protocol to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in 'replay attacks'. For instance, nonces are used in HTTP digest access authentication to calculate an MD5 digest of the password. The nonces are different each time the 401 authentication challenge response code is presented, thus making the replay attack virtually impossible.   (3)In the UK, the term nonce is a slang word used to refer to a sex offender, especially child sexual abusers, and thus as an insult. Folk etymologies for the origins of this word state that the word derives from Not Of Normal Criminal Ethos, used to mean an offender whose motivation was different from the purely acquisitive, or possibly Not On Normal Courtyard Exercise, for prisoners that were not to be mixed with the general population for their own safety. As with most cases, these folk etymologies are examples of backronyms and should not be taken seriously. The actual origin of this word is unknown, but it is probable that it is derived from nancy, a derogatory term referring to homosexual males. Several websites such as Noncewatch have been set up claiming to give details of such people, however whether the information is reliable or not is another matter.	2005-10-10

It was the best advise I could have been told.<br /><br />  The only regret is that I didn't buy it before I started the home schooling this school year but I'm making revisions with the help of this book as I go along.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is wondering what to do when it comes to home schooling.  In fact I've already done so.<br /><br />  I am a licensed teacher so to home school my child didn't scare me.  I love my decision.  My child was misdiagnosed (as we now know he has sensory integration processing dysfunction) and he was making average grades but he's an above average child.  The school was pleased with what he was doing but my husband and I were not. They were also concerned about his behavior problems and felt that he needed help but in the wrong way.  It was due to this that my husband and I decided to home school.<br /><br />  My son is now receiving the correct help for his condition which required occupational therapy.  I can incorporate this into his curriculum.  But I have learned a lot about the way and style in which my child learns and now I can teach in the way that makes him learn much easier.  Also I am not sticking with all the traditional ways of teaching in a classroom.  The teaching methodologies are unique and I love the time we can spend in school and the way we can leave the traditional idea of the classroom sitting and explore the nature.  It's getting back to the basics and doing a more classical learning style and it works for both of us.<br /><br />  I have people who don't agree with what I'm doing.  But my child is going to shine because he's learning and having more fun as I know how to accomodate his needs.  I'm sorry that I didn't start out with home schooling.  I allowed other people to persuade me.<br /><br />  For all of those people who don't believe me I'll lend them a Mary Pride book to them and I will offer my opinion and support most everything that her book has to say.  It really gives me more reasons than I could ever come up before I started home schooling.<br /><br />  Mary, you got a good book.  Wake up America, home schooling is going to keep growing.  Read this book, especially those Christians who have there children in public and even private schools, you'll think twice about what you're doing.them a Mary Pride book to them and I will offer my opinion and support most everything that her book has to say.

US	40608364	R6HXQWHS6F8RZ	0345384229	377076852	The Road to Madness	Books	5	3	5	N	Y	Masterful	I have thought long and hard of how I should contribute a review of The late Howard Philips' Lovecraft for fear that I would not do as good a job as the writer justly deserves. After reading not only what is considered his greatest stories, but a great many of his less famed ones as well, I think that finally I've found a means to give definition to the man's craft. In this review, I will speak of his writing in general, and not just the book above, which caters to a handful of his stories anyway.<br /><br /> Lovecraft's writing has been called fantastic and macabre, has been labeled under the categories of horror, fantasy and science fiction, and after reading most, if not all of his printed stories, I can honestly attest to the fact that all of these terms are true. However, they are not what people today might consider a true science fiction, fantasy or horror story. His science fictions are not set on a starship enterprise, or in the future where we war with other alien races over territories in space-instead, Lovecraft brings an alien germ to our planet, which can't be studied or compared with our own deadly germs since its properties are unknown, in which case, we can do nothing but hope it goes away before it kills us all, or...he brings to us an alien race that has dwelt secretly among us in order to conduct bizarre and often gruesome experiments with our bodies.<br /><br />His fantasies are not set in any imaginary world like in Lord of the Rings. Pretty much all his stories start off with a good foot in reality, leaving little room for fantasy. In fact, the fantasy doesn't come into play until the very end of each story-until the very last few chapters, and sometimes, until the very last few paragraphs.<br /><br /> For me, I feel the most dominant element here is horror. Lovecraft often makes much emphases on secret occults, that no neo-pagan would appreciate, which are often described as evil and sacrifice both animals and children to their evil Gods. The man, or main character, who for some reason feels he needs to unearth these cults-almost always finds himself on the brink of insanity-if not completely insane-by the time he discovers the things these secretive people worshipped are not as fabled as he originally thought. Even in Lovecraft's fantasy stories, the protagonist always meets with sudden and unexpected shock after discovering the many worlds which converge with ours-often ending up dead or in a state of maniacal laughter which later gets him thrown into a sanatorium. So, no matter what genre a Lovecraft story may seem to embrace, all embrace some aspect of horror.<br /><br /> I would also like to state that the writing itself-although very well done-is not what we have grown accustomed to in our modern age where writers are forced to get to the point as quickly as possible. Lovecraft's old style of writing almost always covers the character's professional background, (there wasn't any attempt to bring emotional involvement between reader and character from what I can recall) before actually getting to the story. And when the story finally begins, he tediously lays down fact after fact as a mystrey slowly unravels before the story starts to really kick in. Like I've already mentioned, the fantasy doesn't come into play until the very end of each story. There is also little to no dialog in most of his stories, which was typical for his time. And the writing itself described no action-it's all pretty much telling. This, to some, may seem to drag. Some may also find his writing far fetched. I'll give an example here, from this small piece which for some reason I grew fond of, from his story, `Shadow Out of Space':<br /><br />\\"Primal myth and modern illusion joined in their assumption that mankind is only one-if not least-of the highly evolved and dominant races of this planet's long and largely unknown career. Things of inconceivable shape, they implied, had reared towers to the sky and delved into every secret of nature before the first amphibian forbear of man had crawled out of the hot sea three hundred million years ago.\\"<br /><br />And it's not just this one piece-the whole of all his stories are like this, and it's true some people will not much care for his style of writing. It is not what we are use to.<br /><br />Lovecraft has spent countless hours during his lifetime motivating young amateur writers who found inspiration in his work. He has even developed a literary cult which still exists today (and they have no shame calling themselves just that) which use his mythological monstrosities to create a foundation for their own stories. (Lovecraft encouraged this). Somehow, and this one is beyond me, even a card game was developed based on his monsters, as well as a few PC games. And here and there, throughout other fictions, I can't help but notice the similarities between his fiction and the fiction of today's writers.<br /><br />If you wish to own a large and fulfilling collection of his works, these are my three recommendations:  \\"The Best of H.P. Lovecraft: Bloodcurdling Tales of Horror and The Macabre\\", \\"The Dream Cycle of H.P. Lovecraft: Dreams of Terror and Death\\", and, \\"The Transition of H.P. Lovecraft: The Road to Madness.\\" Each of these contain several of his stories, including all his best, some of which were turned into movies such as, `The Dunwich Horror,' `The Shadow Over Innsmouth,' which became a movie called, `Dagon,' and, of course, `Re-animator.' All utterly failed to capture the true Lovecraft.<br /><br />If you want to just get a taste of the Lovecraft experience (which it has come to be known) I recommend these three popular favorites: \\"The Call of Cthulhu (Horror),\\" \\"The Shadow Over Innsmouth (Horror),\\" \\"The Whisperer in Darkness (Science Fiction,\\" \\"The Colour Out of Space (Science Fiction)\\" \\"The Doom that came to Sarnath (Fantasy),\\" and, \\"The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath (Fantasy).\\" All of which I'm sure you can find individually somewhere.to every secret of nature before the first amphibian forbear of man had crawled out of the hot sea three hundred million years ago.\\" <br /> <br />And it's not just this one piece-the whole of all his stories are like this, and it's true some people will not much care for his style of writing.

To find out that Nissan was already rotting from within by the time Halberstam was finishing his great book, makes this poor one at least an interesting appendix.	2005-10-10

But I truly think this is his best reading ever.  The sheer volume of the cast of characters means that Dale has to produce more original accents and voices with each book.  We must be up to hundreds of characters now.   <br /> <br />Particularly impressive in this installment is what he does with the powerful, poignant scenes near the book's end, especially as regards Dumbledore.  (I don't want to give away any plot secrets here; let me just say that Dale's voice shows us a raw and beautiful vulnerability to Dumbledore that we haven't seen before.) <br /> <br />I think this novel is Rowling's best to date, and Dale's performance matches it in skillful intensity.  It's fantastic.  Readers who zipped through the book when it first came into print will enjoy listening to the audio version in a more leisurely fashion later, noticing clues they missed the first time and reveling in the imagery Rowling has created.  These books seem tailor-made for audio.	2005-10-10

The large cast of characters are each enchanting or entrancing in turn (although, oddly, the protagonist, India Ophuls, is not).  The central tragedy of the story is the transformation of Kashmir from a Garden of Eden populated with warm, humble, enchanting, and enchanted rural villagers, into a ravaged moonscape populated by cold-blooded, fanatic, malevolent marauders from Pakistan and India; the story of Shalimar the Clown and Boonyi recapitulates the tragedy on a personal level, each proceeding toward their respective dooms after Boonyi eats from the forbidden fruit of modernity and Shalimar the Clown becomes an Islamist terrorist by way of passage to the execution of his personal terrorist agenda.    Rushdie's writing is mesmerizing throughout.  The narrative is a dense tapestry that seems to lead in many directions but is all, in the end, tightly woven together.  The only weakness, in my humble opinion, was that his protagonaist, India Ophuls, is an unappetizing character in her own right.  The story of her childhood as the \\"root cause\\" for her unappealing traits is an oddly sociological, Oprah-istic formulation in a novel that is dominated by innocence and evil frankly declared.    Notwithstanding the overarching tragedy of the narrative, there is considerable humor of both the life-affirming and the splenetic varieties.  On the other hand, Rushdie's proper English gentlemanliness creeps in occasionally in his disdain for those sullied by commerce or uniforms.    As someone who does not read a great deal of fiction, I was familiar with Rushdie only because of his unpopularity with the famous literary critic, Ayatollah Khomeini.  I can see from Shalimar the Clown that I have been missing out on one of the most substantial literary talents of our time.	2005-10-10

Castro sounded so good in the beginning, but turned quickly, and caught a lot of Americans and non-believers in his wake. There's plenty of action to keep things moving between the Fidel and the Mafia, and Jack's experience will make you want revenge, too.  Most of all, it's the characters that make Requital unforgettable.  Maybe we all didn't find our first love the way Jennifer did, but we all wish we had!

When did breast feeding become so rigid and compulsory? Probably more than half of all the people you know were NOT breastfeed as babies (depending on your age, maybe as many as 75%)and they turned out absolutely fine. Baby formula is not some Nazi-generated, genocidal poison. <br /> <br />Some women simply don't want to breast feed. Some are sensitive about their breasts, or fear the very likely result that their once-attractive breasts will become ugly and shapeless. Many new moms need to work full-time in offices, factories or retail establishments where trying to pump and store breast milk would be a logistical nightmare (and is it really the milk itself that is so important? or the close contact and nuturing?). Some families want to be able to share the cuddling/feeding/nuturing duties with dad or grandparents or older siblings. <br /> <br />The obsessive need to demonize the above situations and needs is what makes fanatical breast feeding advocates so creepy and Ms. Tamaro fits into that mold. I am all for HER right to breastfeed,but not for her insistance that every do exactly what she does in a rigid, lock-step manner. This is reminiscent of fantaical health food or vegetarian gurus who insist that you eat exactly the way they do (or die!)...or religious fanatics who demand you worship as they do, or face an eternity burning in hellfire! <br /> <br />I also think the gals who feel the need to breastfeed children as old as 2 or 3 (and I have heard of even older children continuing to feed this way!), desperately need a reality check. This kind of extended feeding might make sense fora primitive tribeswoman in the equatorial Amazon...for a modern woman who presumably has some kind of job or other responsiblities as a full-time homemaker, it smacks of obsessive compulsive disorder. Children who are walking, talking, going potty by themselves, and have full sets of teeth do NOT require, need or even want breastfeeding...unless they are simply accustomed to it by a fanatically over-attached \\"smother mommy\\" who is working out some of her own issues...issues that probably surround wanting to avoid the emptiness that can and will exist when her children eventually grow up, as they must. <br /> <br />All I can suggest and I know I am blowing smoke into the wind here, is that you gals read something like Betty Friedan's \\"The Feminine Mystique\\" and get a grip on why you feel you need to expand a simple natural body function into a full-blown fanatical, guilt-inducing movement.	2005-10-10

For that, I am FOR it.  <br /> <br />But looking at the BIG picture, it is upsetting to me. Just as the current government's premise of providing \\"faith-based initiatives\\" (tax money to churches) is worrisome -- in fact, many churches refuse it, to keep the government out of their privacy -- revieving private corporations like mine of ALL tax liability and pushing it onto our customers is unconscionable. <br /> <br />Private coporations are major property owners and rely on government protection of those properties from terrorist, etc. We ALSO SHOULD pay taxes.

The Scouser seems to have been around forever but was just 18 when he made his mark for England at Euro 2004, scoring four goals before injury against Portugal brought an end to his (and England's tournament), but Rooneymania was off and running. Worrall applies some perspective, expressing the view that well though Rooney had played, he probably wasn't even the best player at Euro 2004. But his life changed forever. The story is played out against the backdrop of Malcolm Glazer's takeover of Manchester United, but that is of little concern to the player. After deciding to leave his beloved Everton, he and girlfriend Coleen headed up the East Lancs Road for Old Trafford, with Sir Alex Ferguson blowing 27m on the young maestro. Rooney loves the big occasion and his United debut came in a Champions League match against Fenerbahce. United won 6-2, Rooney scored a hat-trick. Any doubts about whether Ferguson had done the right thing were dispelled in an instant. He produced the goods again when United brought Arsenal's unbeaten run to an end. The Gunners came to Old Trafford looking for a 50th game without defeat, but Rooney played out of his skin as United won 2-0. As the season unfolded, a pattern emerged. Rooney was seldom able to put two storming games together. But, as we are reminded, he was returning from injury and still learning his craft. On top of that, many of his teammates were struggling with form and fitness. The author is a dyed-in-the-red-wool United fan, so it is interesting to note that he takes issue with some of Rooney's excesses on the field, expressing astonishment that Ferguson refused to condemn the player when he should have been sent off against Bolton last season. Worrall also defends Coleen's spending habits - her shopping sprees became front-page news after the move to Manchester - as the actions of a girl who, for the first time in her life, has access to serious money. If she and Wayne were happy, whose business was it anyway? Simply Red reminds us of how far Rooney has already come. This story will run and run. <br /> <br />Review by Derek Clements, The Sunday Times. <br />	2005-10-10

Overall, the book was helpful for someone who is going through a difficult time such as a loss of a child.

He also adequately captures the mentality and motivations of the actors at each stage of events, as they move towards war.  What was missing, in my view, was a larger narrative or overarching theme: it seemed to read like a very long page one article, focused on getting the facts right, while leaving larger judgements to the reader.      I suppose there is a virtue to this approach, but I have to confess it made reading the book a bit tedious for me at points.  In some instances the book was quite incisive.  For example, Woodward recounts how, in an interview with Bush after the war has commenced, he told Bush how Blair had confessed that when he received letters from bereaved parents, saying how much they hated him for killing their child, he - Blair - could not help but experience doubts about the rightness of the whole operation.  Without a moment of reflection, Bush bluntly responded by stating he never experienced any doubts about the war, not even in similar situations.      The key difference between the mentalities of the war's chief proponents, neatly captured in about 200 words.  Unfortunately, such moments of insight were perhaps too few and far between over the course of 400 pages, at least to my liking.	2005-10-10

Today, if you're looking for an AD book, you are probably looking more for a reference guide to facilitate either advanced configuration and troubleshooting, or to enhance your understanding of the more \\"behind the scenes\\" aspects of the AD.<br /><br />In 2002 (when this book was published), I could have recommended this title.  Without a doubt the book gives good historical information on where AD came from, and provides a solid foundation for the systems AD relies on (DNS), as well as planning your AD configuration, deployment in either a clean or migrated environment, security configuration, and AD object management.  Much of the information presented in the domain design, deployment, and security sections however, are either direct reprints or consolidations of already posted (and free) Microsoft documentation, from such titles as Windows 2000 Server Domain Migration Cookbook, Windows Server 2003 Active Directory Domain Rename Tools, Step-by-Step Guide to Kerberos 5 (krb5 1.0) Interoperability, and several other cited Microsoft KB and \\"Step by Step\\" articles.  These references are not hidden, but mentioned in side-bars throughout the text, and you are quite often encouraged to read those texts in addition to the information in this book.<br /><br />The layout of this book lends itself well to those learning or solidifying the basic to intermediate points of the technology.  Although the title would suggest that this is a good reference, references allow one to look at the index or table of contents for the information they need, and get the answers without having to cross-reference many other topics.  Picking a topic, such as application partition creation and management, shows that the information on this is not in one location and in fact requires the reader to have read the preceding topics in order to get a clearer picture.  This is not detractive to the value of the book, but a better classification for this would be textbook.<br /><br />Today, the 2003 AD has been out for many years, more professionals have mastered the topic, and better books are available that provide a less Microsoft-centric take on the AD, as well as proven experience in management in more standard implementations.

I knew nothing about New Zealand prior to reading Dr. Elder's book.  It gets started a little slow, but once going, I felt like a companion traveler with the descriptive narrative of the people and places and foods he experienced.  When I put the book down to attend to my daily tasks, I could hardly wait to get back to it to see what was next.  Granted, Dr. Elder has his likes and dislikes throughout his travel, but then, this does not distract from the \\"meat\\" of the information given in the book.  New Zealand has moved to the top of my list for travel since reading his book.  (One caveat:  My wife, upon reading the book, loved it except she felt the last 3 paragraphs of Chapter 41 could have been left out.  She felt it was just so unexpected and a shock.)  Setting my wife's caveat aside, we would recommend reading this book for a very enjoyable and information-filled trip to New Zealand.	2005-10-10

Two-thirds of the world's biodiversity, according to Baskin (and her footnoted sources) lives underground, \\"the most diverse and abundant web of life known in the universe.\\"<br /><br />Baskin introduces us to a few of these creatures - nematodes earthworms, slime molds, fungi, water bears - and takes us to frozen tundra, wetlands, forests and seabeds where they live.<br /><br />And she introduces us to the people who study them. People like the Wormherders of Antarctica who study nematodes (tiny worms), the most abundant animal on the planet. They study them in Antarctica because it's the one place in the world where if you change something in the soil, or remove one species, you can see the effect. Antarctica is the only place on earth where you can pick up a handful of soil and possibly not find nematodes.<br /><br />Cindy Hale studies earthworms in the forests of Minnesota - a place where there aren't supposed to be any earthworms. Marine biologist Melanie Austen measures nutrient recycling on the ocean floor and the effect of fishing draggers on the tiny living recyclers. And Renata Outerbridge and Tony Trofymow show how selective tree cutting can help the loggers as well as the forest.<br /><br />The creatures themselves are fascinating, not least because of the intricacy and complexity of their interaction with their crowded environment. Like the symbiotic relationship of fungi and tree roots, which involves antibiotics and decay as well as nutrient sharing, and without which, in a sever clear-cut, for instance, trees can never thrive.<br /><br />These creatures are also stranger than anything we see above ground. Nematodes have a gene structure which seems to fit them for survival anywhere on earth and when conditions are inhospitable they dry themselves out and go dormant, for decades if need be. No one has yet determined the upper level of a nematode's ability to revive from a dehydrated state.<br /><br />Earthworms, hermaphrodites the world over (many capable of self-fertilizing), are not always the \\"beneficial\\" creatures we think them. It wasn't until 1995 that scientists discovered earthworms are not native to forests and don't belong there.

This is truly one of the best Bollywood movies to come out in a long, long time. A great commercial hit back in our India, it also swept all the major awards. Though I'm from India where Bollywood movies are compulsory watching, I dislike them for their absurdity but this film has me raving about it. Its simply fabulous.  <br />Set in western India in a prosperous Gujarti household overflowing with people, lives Nandini, our heroine (the beautiful Ashwariya Rai), daughter of a renowned singer Pandit Durbar. Sameer (Salman Khan), a handsome young Italian who comes to learn classical music from the Pandit falls in love with his daughter. As the movie enfolds, we watch the beautifully enacted comedy of the star crossed lovers. But once the father comes to know, all hell breaks loose. Sameer is thrown out of the house, Nandini's heart is broken and she is married of to a young, respectable and well mannered suitor Vanraj (Ajay Devgan) who truly loves her but is detested by Nandini. But the husband also discovers about the affair, is heartbroken too, but decides to take Nandini to Italy to meet her lover.  <br />As the plot moves to Italy (Hungary actually, which the director would have us believe as Italy), we are engaged in Nandini's and Vanraj's troubles of living in a foreign country, finding Sameer and living with each other. As she searches for her love, Nandini comes to know her husband and how much he truly loves her and realizes his grief and sense of loss in losing her. When she finally does find Sameer, she's torn between the two and must choose one of the them and break the heart of the other.  <br />This is Bollywood at its best. Here the wonderful music that goes with this film, it underlines each scene with its sparkling melody. Also the set pieces are lavishly mounted and the music numbers burst upon the sceen. The movie is also very beautifully shot.  <br />This movie also captures Ashwariya rai at her best. She is miraculously beautiful and lights up the screen whenever she's on it.

His conversion became pretty big news within my community because of the fact that he was a Catholic Priest from the east coast who became converted to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints after researching material to write an anti-Mormon book.  I actually had the opportunity to attend a meeting where he rehearsed his conversion story, and even had enough forethought to ask Deseret Book, an LDS publishing company, to record his talk to be sold in-stores (why not turn a profit on both sides of the religious debate since you are already a turncoat anyway?).  I had the opportunity to meet Isaiah, and he was very charismatic.   <br /> <br />During this talk he unequivocally denied the veracity of Catholicism, and embraced the doctrine and culture of the LDS faith.  His talk came out on tape and everybody in the area bought it (my friend actually bought mulitple copies and gave me one, which I still have for comic relief).  Two years later, after being a fully active Mormon, he left the church.  Not surprisingly, he then came out with a series of anti-Mormon books.   <br /> <br />One point of interest is that during his talk he said he started investigating Mormonism to find better anti-Mormon fodder, since most comments or supposed dogmas have been recycled by these types of writers, often for more than a century.  <br /> <br />There is no doubt that his entire foray into Mormonism was to try to leverage some credibility, which he has clearly done since all of his books since that time point out that he is a Mormon-turned-Catholic (they often leave out the fact that he was originally a Catholic).  This man is all-for-profit, and his claims of Mormonism in this book and others are still just the same old recycled trash that has been promulgated over the years.   <br /> <br />Take a pass on this and read something that actually makes people more Christlike.  Try not to make Isaiah's wallet too thick, as plenty of Mormons and Catholics alike have already done so.	2005-10-10

Since they are simply an example of a broader set of folks that fit in this niche I am sure it describes a group larger than, say, a million people. I am not sure how much larger a group it fits. I also suspect that in order to fit in this niche, to have a similar enough web of belief that there is sufficient family resemblance that in a language game about grand narratives, what counts for an individual in this niche must go through a lot of the philosophically \\"bad\\" questions to come to the conclusion that those were bad questions. We have to start simply, even if not as simply as Augustine might have described it. (So there should always be a market for that.)<br /><br />So if the topic is the future of religion we should note how small a market is at stake here. Baptists need not apply. There are books being written for larger audiences with titles like, \\"God's Politics : Why the Right Gets It Wrong and the Left Doesn't Get It\\" by Jim Wallis (number 135 on the Amazon list with 155 reviews compared to \\"The Future of Religion\\" (number 400,363 on the Amazon list with 5 reviews.) That comparison was just a shot in the dark.<br /><br />That being said, Rorty is right on target in describing a niche market I am familiar with and I appreciate the insights. As usual, Rorty says better than I could what I think I thought before I read it. Now I know I think it.<br /><br />Gianni Vattimo too is interesting: \\"\\"If \\"facts\\" thus appear to be nothing but interpretations, interpretation, on the other hand, presents itself as (the ) fact: hermeneutics is not a philosophy but the enunciation of historical existence itself in the age of the end of metaphysics.\\" (p. 45) I confess to being attracted to the book because of Rorty but now will be looking into Vattimo's \\"After Christianity\\".<br /><br />Zabala I found a little more difficult but perhaps that was just because he had the harder job to do.but perhaps that was just because he had the harder job to do. <br />	2005-10-10

Before I write my review I will just give a disclaimer, which is that I enjoyed this book and you probably will too.  It was entertaining.  You will particularly enjoy it if you don't know anything about Marie Antoinette.  I already knew all this stuff and still thought it was fun.  If it's all new to you, you will like the dishy and accurate details of, e.g., the King's inability to consummate the royal marriage for seven whole years.  Great stuff, very dishy, and the author knows how to write a page turner.  So, on that level I say go buy it.  It gave me some hours of fun.  Although, you might find it downright insane that the Diamond Necklace Affair, one of the most infamous court scandals of the 1780s and the one believed to have played a major role in fatally defaming Marie Antoinette, was not mentioned at all!  Not once!  It was important enough to be a recent movie with 2 time oscar winner Hillary Swank, but this author decided not to include a single mention of it.    So, on another, more deeper level, I'm actually a historian so I have to say that this kind of friviolous, uninformative and selective-omission type writing irritates me to a degree. We already know so much about this woman, and while I do not believe she deserved her fate (I'm against the death penalty period!) I think she is a poor subject for literature.  It's interesting that such an ordinary man (Louis the Last) and woman (Widow Capet) with such uninspiring personalities would end up being thrown into such a situation by an accident of fate, but that only goes so far.      After awhile, when you realize there is real history of import out there, you have to wonder why there are thousands upon thousands of books about Marie Antoinette.  It's very elitist.  Let's face it,it's like Princess Diana being on the cover of all those magazines.  Yes, she seemed like a nice lady and yes, it's sad that she ended up in awful situations.  But what about people like Nelson Mandela?  They're a lot more interesting and tell us a lot more about the heroic potential of the human spirit than some woman who, at the end of the day, really was frivolous.  She may not have said \\"Qu'ils mangent du gateau\\" (let them eat cake), but she did spend much money on finery while people starved to death.  A modern-day dictator would hardly be celebrated in fluff literature for such choices.  And if they would, we have to question our values system.      Which brings me to my absolute least favorite part of the book.  It was relatively accurate despite some of the fictious characters-until the end.  It really bothered me that the author takes a Dickensian approach toward revolutionary violence...well, she takes the approach of of all conservative writers from the time of the revolution to now (i.e., Simon Schama).  I don't defend violence, but she made no attempt to understand or portray what drives the desperately poor and needy to acts of intense inhumanity then, and this still happens now.      I understand the author is trying to \\"be\\" Marie Antoinette, so her \\"insights\\" are limited, but I think it's a little ridiculous and contrived to make up a stupid personality for Robespierre and an even dumber meeting between him and the Queen.  The author's Robespierre is based almost entirely on Mme. Roland's memoirs, the famous and bizarre aside Mme Roland made about the Incorruptible having greenish veins which was later turned by Carlyle into the infamous \\"sea-green Incorruptible\\". Madame Roland was about the only source ever claiming Robespierre was \\"green\\".  Most people said he was quite pleasant looking.  I ought to know.  I've read about seventeen biographies on the man.  (Don't ask).    She exaggerated everything about him and completely obscured his actual personality. He was misguided, but not in the way she portrayed it.       It was a total recycled, post-Thermidorian cartoon of the man, which is not good history, it's not even decent historical fiction.  He wasn't out of control in the way she wrote it.  Also, he stands in for every other revolutionary.  Only Marat and Mirabeau are mentioned, and barely at that.      Keep in mind that it's awful history and think of it more as \\"Jackie Collins in 18th Century France\\".  Which is fine, but I still think they could've made it a little less ridiculous.  I don't like real historical figures to be simplified down to cartoon characters.  The cartoon gets remembered and nothing else-which is the dumbest form of history out there.	2005-10-10

It doesn't feel dated however.   <br /> <br />This book offers examples.  Before needle exchanges took place in the US, they were shown to work in Australia and other countries.  One author said drug users need to organize like the gay male community has.  At first, this sounded naive, but the author stated that it has happened in the Netherlands.  This book mentions solutions that work:  using bleach on syringes, having drug addicts teach each other about avoiding STDs, etc.  This book implies that drug addicts have learned to clean their needles, but that hasn't helped them to have safer sex.  I wish I could have learned more about cocaine generally:  how to spot a user, how to know if someone has re-started, how to encourage them to quit drug use because they may contract the virus. <br /> <br />I won't call this book homophobic, but it's a bit heterosexist.  Several authors state that, \\"cocaine users could spread HIV to their children and wives.\\"  There is little discussion of the many MSM who also use drugs.  What about the fact that they may be spreading the virus to non-drug-using male lovers?  The book never mentions that some straight-identified drug users engage in same-sex prostitution to score drugs.  Thus, though they do not identify as \\"gay,\\" they may get the virus through same-sex sexual activities.	2005-10-10

Basil Pennington brings Christians to the concept of lectio.  More than just reading the Bible, lectio is absorbing the word of God through numerous means.  We are to listen for the voice of God in our hearts, our neighbors, and other interactions with society.  Through this, we will grow in our relationship to God.<br /><br />Pennington has selected 40 entries in scripture for reflection which are concise but enlightening reads.  I was surprised to note that Pennington even managed to inject humor into various points that give a new light to scripture as a Sunday sermon often does.  Taking each story separately, the reader will enjoy the greatest benefit.  The reader will need time to reflect on what he/she has read.<br /><br />In the same breath, the author also encourages lectio through reading other Christian books.  He is not trying to hawk his book, just foster the spiritual development of others.  This is a great little book.	2005-10-10

And having lived quite a sheltered life, she isn't used to life at court and finds herself a prime target for gold diggers and the subject of ridicule by the more sophisticated ladies. But nothing will compare to the battle she faces with the man she finally marries.<br /><br />Ian MacLagan is a man who carries the physical and emotional scars of his past. Blaming himself for his wife and child's death, he has sworn to never remarry and has shielded his heart from any woman. So it was to his shock and anger when the king orders him to marry Islaen. With no choice but to obey his liege, Ian resolves not to share her bed for fear of bringing harm to her. Yet it was a promise that will never be fulfilled for Islaen proves more irresistible than he ever expected.<br /><br />PROMISED PASSION is the sequel to AMBER FLAME featuring Tavis and Storm, which to this day remains one of my most favorite historical romances. Until recently, I've been hoping for a sequel not knowing that there is one. As with the first book, the characters are very likable and the supporting cast quite entertaining. Islaen, although started off a little timid, proved to be of strong character. She never gave up trying to get through the wall that Ian has built around him, and her determination is what makes her admirable. As for Ian, he does prove to be quite stubborn in his belief, but it is quite understandable for it is brought upon by his fear for Islaen's life. And we do see him struggle with his emotions as we see him try to hold on to her with one hand, while pushing her away with the other. But we all know that sooner or later, the man will come to his senses. And who better to help him? None other than the charming Alexander MacDubh. If he was a charmer in AMBER FLAME, he is more so in this book. A real ladies man, I enjoyed how he made Ian so jealous.<br /><br />An entertaining and easy read, I enjoyed this book though I must admit that I wasn't as captivated as I was with the first book.

I was shocked and, at times, appalled by the way Orenstein could easily criticize the behaviors of young boys, teachers, parents and even the girls she wrote in defense of. While these pages have insights to offer, they don't come from the author's stereotypical, biased statements and instead come from whatever she has offered to us in quotes (essentially the words of someone other than her). In reading this for my college course, we were asked to identify the main thesis of the book, and all looked to each other for help. Not one of 60-odd college students could identify Orenstein's main idea or point. While it seems she is trying to express that young girls have a low self-image due to the education system, that is contradicted many times over when we see some of the girls have low self-esteem because of their home life, and some girls have extremely high self-esteem. Perhaps her book would better be titled \\"Everyone is Different, No Two People Are the Same\\"? <br />But of course that title would not give way for the male-bashing this book includes in what comes in a sexist light. On page 16 when a student named Dawn is reprimanded for being disruptive but a boy in the class is given the same warning - only his comes with a smile, Orenstein writes \\"There is a tacit acceptance of a disruptive boy, because boys are disruptive. Girls are too, sometimes, as Dawn illustrates, but with different consequences.\\" We find many more examples like this of Orenstein stating her opinions and blanket statements without giving us as readers the chance to form our own opinion. What if the boy had a learning disability that caused him to act out? What if for him that was typical behavior while 'Dawn' had been quiet in the past and recently started showing rebellion? What if maybe teachersare human beings too, and make mistakes? I know that sounds impossible, but it's true! <br />This is only one example of many that I found in this book that were slightly disturbing to me. It is unfortunate that Orenstein peppered her accounts with her personal views because all of these young girls' stories are powerful and moving. However as important those stories are, they are laid out in such a fashion that (again) it is hard to see any clear message through their telling. As an educator I only find the third section of this book (\\"Through the Looking Glass\\") to be of any use in how to teach history with equality in mind. In order to get through the first two sections, one only has to ignore Orenstein and strive to see what is truly taking place beyond her journalistic liberties.	2005-10-10

Of course the book is about his trials and tribulations trying to do just that, but he handles all the misfires and disappointments with relatively good cheer and a fair amount of determination.  Cool book, especially for a music lover, and not at all pretentious or skanky.	2005-10-10

To answer her critics who are only aware of sanitized traditions emphasizing differences between religions, she conjures an even more heavily documented retort with devastating facts that can not be ignored in her superb thesis, \\"Suns of God: Krishna, Buddha, and Jesus Unveiled\\".   <br /> <br />This is the anthropological \\"in your face\\" answer to the distressing hordes who, through unrelenting demagoguery, insist that their culturally determined brand of theological spirituality is the one and only revealed truth, whether from some aging literary artifact or derivative thereof.  She  documents the evidence that Christianity is as much myth as the myths cherished by their Mediterranean predecessors.  The evidence she presents is boundless and contradicted by only the willfully ignorant.  Evidence is worthy of scrutiny in a rational society.  The burden logically is on the religionists to prove that their brand is the key to truth and absolute moral certitude.  They never have or could scrounge up comparable evidence for proof.     <br /> <br />The general subject of this study so contradicts entrenched cultural assumptions, excessive scholarly methodologies to the point of pedantic discourse would be wasted effort.  I fear Dr. Robert Price among others, is more concerned with originality in scholarship than the popular liberation that this information has offered to so many oppressed by the dogmas of institutional religion.  Along with Peter Gandy and Timothy Freke, the author serves up flavorful truths prepared with just the right dash of the pungent pamphleteer.       <br /> <br />Churlish and juvenile crticisms are waged against the author  because she affects a \\"nom de plume\\".  Where are these reviewers' tirades against the very estimable George Sand, Mark Twain, Lewis Carroll, George Eliot, George Orwell, etc., etc.  For those who are dubious of her credentials, Acharya S has recently been appointed as a Fellow of the esteemed Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion (CSER).  She shares this honor with other specialists in the foundations of religion such as Robert Eisenman and Karen Armstrong.  In completing her formal education, she was honored with a life long appointment to the very selective American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Greece.             <br /> <br />It is the reader's choice  -- the subjective faith defined by unyielding dogmas, or evidence with dogmas editorialized.       <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

An icky, but essentially boring fact of life (like sewage, which also comes into the discussion). True, it is a guilt-inducing environmental hazard we ordinary mortals can't do much about, but there are all sorts of people out there for whom your detritus is a livelihood, a challenge, a crusade or all three.<br /><br />And Elizabeth Royte's lively, anecdotal adventure on the trail of trash introduces us to many of them, from the two sanitary workers who personally shift 20,000 pounds in the four hours she accompanies them, to the head of San Francisco's recycling program who manages to divert 95 percent of his household trash from the landfill in headlong pursuit of Zero Waste.<br /><br />Royte frames the story around her own household trash in Brooklyn, NY. For a year she weighs and sorts it, taking notes on its contents. She wants to know where it goes when it leaves her. Her first foray with a \\"san man\\" (New York has one female garbage collector) team is an eye opener.<br /><br />\\"The men seemed dour and angry to me and I was afraid to ask them questions. On foot, I watched and I followed. Soon I realized they seemed sour only because they were concentrating. In constant motion, lifting heavy barrels, they could get hurt if they didn't pay attention. Metal cans banged against their legs; trailer hitches poked from high SUV bumpers. Drivers honked, urging the men to hustle it up, to get their truck out of their way. Double-parked delivery vans blocked their progress. There was also a surprising amount of dog [dirt] near the garbage cans and many plastic bags were shiny with urine. Had I never noticed this before?\\"<br /><br />Garbage collection, it turns out, is three times more likely to get you killed than being a fireman or a policeman.<br /><br />A couple of transfer stations later (from which most of NYC's garbage heads to other states) Royte is ready for a real landfill. Although now closed, \\"the Fresh Kills Sanitary Landfill was the K2 of trash heaps, and I was determined to make an assault on its closed and forbidden slopes.\\" Unable to get in, she explores the evolution of landfills in grisly detail, makes a canoe foray around the place through a successful salt marsh restoration, describes state-of-the-art dump technology and its various oozing, leaching failures, and then fails to get into a lesser Pennsylvania dump -the final resting place of her own actual trash.<br /><br />People who handle large amounts of our trash, Royte discovers again and again, are more than a little secretive. \\" `This isn't goods they're transferring from place to place,' \\" she's told, \\" `This is bads.' \\"<br /><br />Amusing and adroit as Royte is, landfill descriptions lose their savor after an unsurprisingly short time, but she moves on to incinerators, waste-to-energy incinerators, sewage and sludge fertilizer and myriad forms of recycling. Not a one of them is a winner in the fight against expense, pollution and energy consumption.<br /><br />Waste to energy plants seem like a dream come true. Burn garbage and furnish energy. But the plants are very expensive and the toxins they produce - both airborne and ash - contain things like dioxins, mercury, lead and sulphuric acid, to name a few.<br /><br />Recycling efforts teem with politics, psychology and futility. Some environmentalists are avid recyclers; others object to recycling as a panacea that soothes the guilt of the average householder, making us feel like we're doing our bit, and takes the heat off manufacturers who should be held ultimately responsible for the things (especially the packaging) they produce. Yes, recycling can save trees, but recycling uses energy and produces toxins. Plastic recycling is particularly problematic.<br /><br />And, to put things in perspective, 98 percent of all trash is pre-consumer. Industrial. But Royte, who would clearly like to reduce her own garbage \\"footprint,\\" weighs it all, keeps her sense of humor, and arrives at a balance. Reduce, reuse, recycle.<br /><br />- Portsmouth Heraldr own garbage \\"footprint,\\" weighs it all, keeps her sense of humor, and arrives at a balance.

Harry Houdini, Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle, and others who gather to discuss famous paranormal cases. The men in the club ponder all the known facts about the matters and then offer their opinions as to the nature of the events. In some cases the noted gentlemen argue that the cases were fraud and in others that genuine preternatural forces were at work.<br /><br />The two incidents covered in Other Worlds were the infamous Bell Witch haunting of antebellum Tennessee, and a less famous but in some ways more shocking case--equally grounded in fact--of a New England family of the mid-1800's, whose home was seemingly invaded by a very creepy poltergeist phenomenon that begins making strange, eerie noises, moves on to rearranging furniture (while the family is IN the home) and from there proceeds from creating menacing \\"dolls\\" of each family member, twisted and shaped out of articles of the family's clothing. The case, inexplicably forgotten today except in the most scholarly of paranormal journals, reaches a crescendo I won't give away here but which surely, if true, reveals something stunning about what we hold to be reality.<br /><br />This book seems to have frustrated some because it does not conclusively debunk or confirm these cases, it tells the details as they are known, composes some possible explanations, and then lets the reader form her own views. I think many wanted a revelation along the lines of \\"this is how it happened\\". And of course that's impossible.<br /><br />This is a fun book for those who have an interest in events that fall outside what we like to feel are \\"everyday mundane\\" and its literary tone makes a nice touch considering the period the stories took place in.	2005-10-10

For many, maybe most, modern life just is. There is little understanding or even interest in the forces that shape, or more perniciously control, lives. That ignorance in no way disestablishes corporations as the most powerful, self-serving entities of the modern era. However, this book is not particularly concerned with all of the ramifications of their immense power to influence and control society.<br /><br />The book primarily examines the profound change in the legal standing of corporations that occurred in the last half of the nineteenth century and into the first decades of the twentieth. Though not heavily argued, the author contends that Americans in the colonial period were very leery of corporations. After the founding, corporations came into existence only via state charters that specifically detailed and limited a corporation's activities with the real possibility of charter revocation acting as an effective incentive for compliance. But business interests began to battle those limitations, especially on the legal front.<br /><br />The Santa Clara County case decided by the Supreme Court in 1886 was the case on which the subsequent legal empowerment of corporations was based. Though not specifically stated in the opinion, it is commonly held that after that decision, corporations would be viewed as \\"persons,\\" the subject of the fourteenth Amendment, whereby all persons are entitled to due process and the equal protection of laws. Even the great John Marshall in 1819 had asserted that corporations are an \\"artificial being ... existing only in the contemplation of law.\\" Now the artificial nature of corporations was being disregarded, clearing the way for consideration as the equal of any citizen with all of the same rights. The fact that corporate resources overwhelm those of any one person appears to not have been considered.<br /><br />In the laissez-faire, Social Darwinist atmosphere of the early twentieth century individuals were left to compete with their corporate \\"equals.\\" Time and again legislation that sought to ameliorate dreadful workplace conditions was struck down as interfering with liberty of contract, ignoring the one-sidedness of employer-employee exchange.<br /><br />The same thinking is seen in decisions regarding participation in the political process. The author shows how the courts have subtly distorted the meaning of the First Amendment as protecting corporate \\"speech.\\" In actuality, the amendment protects speakers - real people, not entities. The real speech of corporate stakeholders, such as customers, has routinely been suppressed. For example, a quarterly consumer's section in an energy utility's newsletter was disallowed, despite the utility's monopoly of the region.<br /><br />The author shows that legal decisions regarding corporate personhood have since Santa Clara been very inconsistent and even contradictory. One would have thought that the author would have weighed in on the \\"strict construction\\" arguments that have been the  rage over the last few decades. The reading of corporations as persons by the courts is a definite distortion of original intent. Moreover, the original intent of constructing a nation of self-governing citizens has been seriously eroded by allowing monolithic entities to dominate arenas where citizens participate, like elections.<br /><br />The author notes that several movements at the turn of the nineteenth century attempted to counter corporate power, namely the Populists, the Knights of Labor, the IWW, and the socialists. Virtually all of them ran into the power of the state and reactionary forces that contained and eliminated the movements. Some of this material is rather sketchy.<br /><br />In recent years corporations have gained tremendous advantages by being able to relocate internationally facilitated by any number of trade agreements. Through the WTO and other bodies, corporations are able to force nations to rescind legislation that they see as impacting their profitability. The modern anti-corporate movement often takes the form of anti-globalization, perhaps best seen in the Seattle demonstrations against the WTO. In addition, the author hopes for cooperatives or economic democracy as alternatives to corporate power. Such efforts have had little impact.<br /><br />Any number of authors have addressed the dominance of corporations, such as Bakan, Greider, Hartmann, Korten, Schweickart, etc. This book is less comprehensive than those by the authors mentioned. It is a reasonable and readable overview of the legal shenanigans and rationalizations that have occurred concerning the rightful place of corporations in our society over the last 125 years.

While many newer, more developmentally based ABA-hybrids such as Verbal Behavior embrace the idea of teaching functional language in context (as someone mentioned belowed - rather than teaching someone to say 'ball' and rewarding them with a cookie, it seems more functional to teach them 'ball' and give them an actual ball), this is the more 'old school' style ABA.<br /><br />In my personal experience, this program works for some kids by serving as a kind of mass-stimulation approach. If you can get a child who is young enough, and bombard them with language, attending, and imitation skills for enough hours (whether in context or not), then, for SOME children, it appears that the stimulation of these parts of the brain is enough. This makes sense when you think about the 'survival of the busiest' theory of neural development. Eventually they reach a point where they take over and start learning on their own.<br /><br />For the kids who never reach that point and do no start picking up these skills independently, however, I would recommend a more functional approach. These are the cases where a child replies \\"seven\\" when asked 'How old are you?' at eighteen because they were drilled on this question at seven years old but never understood it. These can also be the kids who sit down at the ABA teaching table and perform all of their tasks like party tricks in order to be rewarded, but never carry this over to spontaneous language because it is not meaningful to them.<br /><br />Overall, it seems that the newer forms of ABA (ie Verbal Behavior) address both issues by doing mass stimulation AND making it meaningful. 'Classic' ABA has proved a powerful tool for some (not all, but some) children, however.	2005-10-10

Those of jalape&ntilde;o are really delicious, here in Mexico we eat a lot of chili and that recipe loved to my family.  I also made those of goat cheese with tomato, only I made a variable, I changed the fresh tomato for dehydrated tomato and them they gave a very special and delicious touch.  I made those of cinnamon, but it happened me something terrible, the recipe says that I should use 1 1/2 teaspoon of powder of baking and 1/2 of baking soda, but I confused the recipe and I used 1 1/2 of baking soda and you will already be able to imagine that almost they explode later in the point oven that they weighed, they descended and they were awful, it was impossible to eat them because they came undone!!  Then I made them with the exact proportions again and they were very good.  I really find the book good, here in Mexico we can get books of Williams-Sonoma, but this of Muffins I have not seen it in any bookstore.  It is for that reason that it loved so much to my family, because it was a novelty for them.	2005-10-10
US	41905526	R2DDS7C8SGG71M	0060935332	650878863	Master Butchers Singing Club, The	Books	5	19	19	N	N	The other side of Argus	For her eighth novel, Erdrich stays within the confines of her fictional North Dakota town of Argus, but she focuses less on its Native American denizens than on its German immigrant population. As with her previous efforts, however, it's still a personal odyssey; as she notes in her acknowledgments, the inspiration for the novel is her grandfather (pictured on the jacket of the hardcover edition), who \\"fought in the trenches of the German side of World War I\\" before emigrating to the United States, and whose \\"sons served on the American side in World War II.\\"<br /><br />With the change in focus comes an appropriate change in pitch: there's far less magic realism and far more European naturalism. At times, the events and characters of \\"The Master Butchers Singing Club\\" resemble those from an offbeat soap opera, but Erdrich is far too deft a writer to let melodrama get the better of her storytelling. Beyond the occasional similarity to Lynch's Twin Peaks and the Coen brothers' Fargo, the more obvious influences are the prairie towns imagined by Sinclair Lewis and Willa Cather.<br /><br />The character modeled after her grandfather, Fidelis Waldvogel, arrives from Europe with his wife and a suitcase filled with sausage, which proves to be his currency to reach the Eden he imagines to be found in the Pacific Northwest. The money earned from sales of the meat, however, gets him only as far as the godforsaken desert of North Dakota, where he eventually becomes a much-admired shopkeeper and a stalwart member of the community. On the outskirts of the town lives the novel's heroine, Delphine Watzka, who has returned to her father's home from life on the road in a vaudeville show with her alleged husband, who (it is soon revealed) lives a double life. Eventually, the paths of these two dissimilar and distinctive families cross in momentous and bizarre ways<br /><br />The novel contains enough twists and mysteries to keep the pages turning: there's a triple killing uncovered upon Delphine's return, which is all the more inexplicable because the chief witness, her father, was too drunk to remember what happened; a terrifying tunnel collapse; an eccentric bag lady known as Step-and-a-Half, who has a couple of secrets all her own; and more. While each episode and revelation ranges from the farcical to the grisly, Erdrich mitigates the potential for Dickensian excess by subtly examining the effects of these events (some of which occur offstage) on her characters and on the community. And, although her work has always been infused with a comic edge, Erdrich displays a mordant (yet not unkind) wit here that differs from the tone of her earlier work.<br /><br />Above all, Erdrich has written a celebratory and emotional ode to the \\"other\\" side of her family, whose fortitude and charisma she clearly admires (and it's not hard to see why). Although she reassures us that \\"the book is fiction except for snout salad, the bull's pizzle, and my grandmother's short stint as a human table in a vaudeville act,\\" the reverence and the affection are as raw as the North Dakota wind.which is all the more inexplicable because the chief witness, her father, was too drunk to remember what happened; a terrifying tunnel collapse; an eccentric bag lady known as Step-and-a-Half, who has a couple of secrets all her own; and more.

I found it helped, for the half of the book that I forced myself through, to read it with the same intonation as Dylan's voice.   <br /> <br />The book goes approximately like this:  I woke up in Joe and Jan's apartment in Greenwich Village one frosty morning.  I got up, and later, I wrote a folk song, just the way Woody and Leadbelly used to.  When I was done, it was strong and direct and true and spoke of the heart of America, just like frosty mornings and Greenwich Village and apartments, so valid and insightful.  Later they tried to make me be a savior or a messiah.  I never wanted to be a savior or a messiah.  I only wanted to write folk songs, strong and direct and true, and speaking of the heart of America.  Robbie Robertson asked me once why I wouldn't be the spokesman for my generation. We were in the car when he asked, and I had to roll the window down and let the wind blow that question away. <br /> <br />And so on.

Images from the silver screen and TV mix with insights into life; reflections of today as seen through the slightly skewed perception of Hollywood creating images ingrained in our imaginations and unleashed for inspection through Trowbridge's insight. Stan and Ollie cavort as representatives of sex and anger confronted by authority; the \\"magma landscape\\" of the shoe exhibit at the Holocaust museum, and Michael's kiss of death for his brother Fredo are some of the images that Trowbridge uses as a base for his word play. <br />There are also a number of trips into Trowbridge's personal life, childhood remembrances and painfully examined relationships with aged parents that allow you into the true wonder of what well written poetry can accomplish; a truth and emotion that only poetry can convey. <br />The only misfires here are the series of poems featuring The Glad's, a sort of pseudo suburban family that seems more than a bit heavy handed in its attempt at satire. But the poems that work are truly memorable and will stay with you for a long time. <br />	2005-10-10

The plot is hilariously bad. An American hops on a plane to Peru with no clear idea of why, and then gets swept up in a race for an ancient manuscript. The author tells us the manuscript is a secret, but then he puts its contents in the hands and voices of virtually every character in the book. He expects us to believe the Peruvian government is scared of the manuscript's contents, and that we are supposed to be scared of the Peruvian military. I am more scared about how this book wound up on the New York Times bestseller list (I found a free used copy and survived its contents during an airplane flight).

Don Silver has created a character I really care about, Chuck Puckman. Puckman is someone who has never sauntered down main street in his own glow, but how many people ever do? Puckman has pretty much ridden on the sidecar of everyone else's life, and that's why I care about him. The main dramatic question is this: Is Chuck Puckman going to get his life back after being severely swindled and betrayed by his brother, haunted by a radical past, dogged by legal authorities for an industrial accident that wasn't quite his fault, shadowed by his own drug abuse, and few other serious things? <br /> <br />Backward-Facing Man has great descriptive writing. The level of detail is so lifelike that I could smell the marijuana in the none-too-tidy apartments of college-age kids, the bacon frying in the diner, and even the toxic industrial chemicals that play a key role in one of the plot lines. There are head-trippy scenes from the Sixties, glimpses of a cult-like rural commune that happens to be the hideout of violent, paranoid early 1970s radicals complete with Patty Hearst, wild and exotic vistas of Belize, and a grimy old factory in Philadelphia that malingers like the corpse of industry. If you like literary thrillers, you'll love Backward-Facing Man. <br />	2005-10-10

Volume I contains The Stolen Throne, which is told from the Marukaner Abivard's point of view, and Hammer and Anvil, which moves to the Videssian Empire six years later.  Abivard starts off his novel as a diqhan, a landholder in the frontier area, who ends up helping the rightful King of Marukan regain his throne.  In order to defeat the usurping King, Abivard must join forces with the Emperor of Videssos, and a price will be paid for that cooperation. <br /> <br />Hammer and Anvil has protagonist Maniakes, who leads an insurrection against the bloodthirsty Videssian Emperor (who gained the throne by murdering the previous Emperor, the very one who helped Abivard in the previous novel). <br /> <br />Once again the books closely follow the history of the Byzantine Empire, with magic overlayed here and there.  This is the same formula, history meets fantasy, used in the Darkness series (which retold World War II as a sword and sorcery epic) and the Peachtree trilogy (The US Civil War).  Turtledove, as always, does it well.   <br /> <br />I can't give the book (the two novels) five stars because the characters are too similar to Turtledove's other heroes: logical-thinking straight-talking types married to women much like themselves.  The characters observe repeatedly that war kills people, that women do battle in the birthing bed, and that people are people the world over.  The books are enjoyable but don't make the leap to profound.	2005-10-10

His biggest contribution on globalism is telling the biggest secret in the world today: That democracy, free trade, unregulated markets and the economic ideology of the west are not necessary for economic prosperity.  He shows for example that in spite of China doing everything \\"wrong\\" according the models of modern economics, they are wildly successful.  China prospers with exchange rates pegged to favor exports, a lack of political freedom, pays no attention to intellectual property rights and has heavyweight state planning and regulation. <br /> <br />In the west, he shows how deregulation of certain industries has rather than creating competition lead to the exact opposite.  That rather than competition, the result is inevitably oligopoly or monopoly and division of markets.  The only fact he misses on the subject is that the large corporations usually in reality have negative economies of scale operationally and that their competitive advange is based on negotiating discounts from suppliers (based on their volume) which are subsidized by their smaller competitors. <br /> <br />Where the book falls down is in offering solutions.  Saul is too stuck in the past in that regard.  But even with his limitations he is the most insightful and honest writer out there on these subjects.   <br />	2005-10-10

I was SO excited to read it when I first came across it here on Amazon-I just can't get enough books to read about sailors, the Navy and especially gay sailors, fiction or non fiction. (Steven Zeeland's book are WONDERFUL!!).  I even bought the first 2 books in the set \\"Foolish Fire\\" (very hard to locate a reasonably priced copy) and \\"Mirrors of Narcissus\\", and would not read \\"Navy Blue Dreams\\" until I had read the first two. Well-I've read all 3 books in a week and first found out that it really wasn't necessary to read them together as they don't really have a continuum. <br /> <br />Then what I noticed with all the books (I do not have plans on reading the fourth book), I had no idea what the time or place of these books setting has.  I think it had to be in the early 1980's but still have no idea where in the U.S.  I like to have those facts when reading a book like this.  Then he also never gave very graphic descriptions of the men he encountered along the way (i.e. hair color, general body description, etc.) and so basically everything left me wondering way too much.  My imagination doesn't stretch that far-I need details.  Once given a little information I can conjure up things in my mind. <br /> <br />And he never described the sexual experiences with much description either.  I don't need a terribly pornographic detailing, but he really gave any and let's face it, the book is really all about Guy's sexual awakenings.  And speaking of sexual things, that is the other thing that really bothered me.  That the author did not portray the character as a very positive gay role model at all!!  All the sexual experiences were frivolous and unromantic.  The type that society hates homosexuals for- in bushes, parks, hotel rooms, in public, anonymous, etc.  Yet there is more detail  and normalcy with Guy's heterosexual experiences.   <br /> <br />This book was supposed to be about a homosexual awakening in a young man, but there sure is a LOT of heterosexual goings-on.  What was the need for that??    Why was all this confused with gay and straight stuff?  Was this autobiographical???   There are better gay coming out stories than this one. <br /> <br />Lastly, I don't think the Navy was portrayed in the best light either.  I would NEVER say anything bad about the U.S. Navy or Marine Corps, and the Guy's being in the Navy doesn't  become one of his better life experiences, he even gets a discharge in disgrace.  Why couldn't he have gotten through his enlistment and been seen as a normal young man who blossomed into this true sexual nature without all the heterosexual incidents, and completing his full enlistment honorably??  There wasn't enough of the naval and shipboard life that there should have been in this book.  Lots of taking us around to different countries which I didn't care about at all.  I wanted to know about being on a ship and being gay.  I thought this would be the basis of the book. There wasn't enough of this. The book was a letdown, but yet I still feel a certain fondness for it because I LOVE SAILORS.	2005-10-10

I do not see how it will cut spending, eliminate or reduce the power of any federal agencies or departments, nor do I even see how it will reduce the amount of tax collected by the federal gov't.  <br /> <br />Even the book says it is \\"revenue neutral\\"! And with the elimination of the IRS, a new, specific agency within the Treasury Department will have to oversee this new tax, and as I've stated before, it is highly likely, given the tax history in America, and the use of taxation as a \\"social engineering\\" tool, that this tax will become just as cumbersome, complicated and intrusive as the income tax.  <br /> <br />The real problem however with the enactment of this tax will be the legitimization of the federal government taxing consumption. That means that every transaction is legitimized as fair game for the feds to stick their nose in. The general population already believes that \\"those who earn more should pay more\\", and with this tax \\"those who consume more should pay more\\". Thus, every part of our financial lives is now under the thumb of potential scrutiny of the federal government. <br /> <br />Let's work to ELIMINATE taxes, or at the very least, reduce the existing ones, and not enact new ones! <br />	2005-10-10

Hedren has chosen 54 specific historical sites relating to the Great Sioux War and arranged them chronologically, with site 1 being the Grattan Battlefield in Wyoming (commemorating an 1854 incident which helped set the stage for later events) and site 54 being Sitting Bull's grave in South Dakota (he died in 1890). In addition to these 54 \\"official\\" sites, Hedren identifies and directs readers to many other related locations nearby.<br /><br />Each site gets a number (which is also pin-pointed on a map), a brief description of the its significance, and directions to it (also whether it's on private property or not); then follows a longer historical account of the site's role in the War and a number of photographs indicating what a visitor to the site would see. It's a magnificent tool for anyone touring the area (most sites are in Wyoming, Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska), but it's just as valuable (and exciting) for anyone interested in the Sioux War who can't leave his livingroom. A great book. Highly recommended.	2005-10-10

Once upon a time, there lived a mighty Macedonian commander who led his army into victory over the Romans. He was revered by the goddess Athena and feared by his enemies. Some even said he was to be the next Alexander the Great. But power attracts jealousy. And nobody was more eager to destroy him than his own brother. Jealous of Julian's popularity and great looks, Priapus, a lesser-known god hands him the ultimate punishment - that of a man trapped in a book with no company but darkness and solitude. The mighty commander was reduced to nothing more than a sex slave cursed into an eternity of loneliness. For two thousand years, Julian of Macedon would be under the mercy of women until one fateful night in New Orleans.<br /><br />Four years ago, Grace Alexander lost two of the people she loved the most. To add to her devastation, the first man to show any interest in her took advantage of her grief over her parents' death and has since shattered her trust in men. Then her psychic friend Selena stumbles upon Julian's book and convinces her to conjure him up on the night of her birthday. So several glasses of wine later, Grace decides to indulge Selena and as the clock strikes midnight with the full moon shining on her, she calls out to Julian of Macedon three times not expecting that it will work. But before she knew what was going on, she finds him naked in her living room offering his service to her. And from that moment on, her life would never be the same.<br /><br />FANTASY LOVER is a fun and original story that had me enthralled from the very first page. I absolutely loved Julian and had this mental picture of a perfect Greek god oozing with immense power and sexuality. And I was glad that Grace wasn't made out to be the beautiful damsel in distress, which we see a lot of in romance novels. In fact, she is smart and independent yet average looking. What really immersed me into the story is the humor and passion between them. From the outside, we have two people who are as different as night and day, yet deep down, they have so much in common that forms a bond between them. Both have suffered the humiliation and pain of rejection and both have lived the life of outsiders. Julian is the first man who didn't find her lacking and made her feel desirable and protected. In return, Grace is the first person to see beyond his face and body, and the only one who actually gave a damn about him when everyone else has treated him like an object to be used. And this is what drew them together and what creates an absorbing story that will have you glued from the very start.<br /><br />A fantastic, exciting and extremely hot novel, I guarantee that you wouldn't be able to put this down. Believe me, learning to drive a stick has never sounded so hot!  And who would have thought that those gods and goddesses in Mt Olympus could be so funny? This book was an absolute joy! I laughed, cried a little and cheered for both of them.erent as night and day, yet deep down, they have so much in common that forms a bond between them.

She has a personal stake in it since she lost her younger sisters life to a gang.  Bailey's family though close knit is forever worrying about the lengths she is willing to go to, to save these teens.  Her methods put her at a cross purposes to Senator Clay Wainright. <br /> <br />Clay Wainright is an up and coming politician.  Bailey O'Neil has been a thorn in his side since he sent her to jail for a year over ten years ago.  Now as a Senator he is assigned with Bailey to the same task force to address gangs.  Their views are as different as night and day. Sparks fly in their discussions on the task force. But an all-consuming passion erupts between them outside of those meetings. <br /> <br />This isn't an easy romance for either party, each has issues from the past not just their opposite views.  Clay is determined to protect Bailey and Bailey is equally determined to save these teens at all cost. <br /> <br />Someone To Believe In grabs you and pulls you in.

I am a very big fan of Pavel and his books, he is definately a leader in intelligent and effective strength training methods...however if it werent't for that I probably would have put the book down as soon as he started the sales pitch.

The book does an excellent job of refuting several of the world views that were expoused in philosophy classes I took in college.  At the time, it was difficult to sift through each of these systems and make sense of them. <br /> <br />Now, I understand why it made no sense.  Dr. Sproul, destroys these systems of so-called intellectualism with the greatest of ease and precision.  He reduces each argument down to simple english and then uses their own statements and logic to refute them. <br /> <br />If you are looking for an incredible introduction to the world of non-presuppositional apologetics, look no further.  Dr. Sproul tore down every stronghold he opposed.   <br /> <br />In my humble opinion, the book delivered on all of its promises.  As an author myself, I understand how difficult it is to convey ideas in book format and then to present complete arguments that cover all the details that readers may expect or anticipate.

The hero and heroine have next to nothing in common and many reasons to dislike each other, but to paraphrase the hero's own thoughts, all the heroine needs is a sexual encounter with him, and she'll come around and love him. And sure enough, that's how the story unfolds. Against her wishes and the wishes of her people, and with all the romantic finesse of a codfish, the hero forces her to marry him (although he's made it clear he suspects she murdered her previous husband), and essentially wins her over with a satisfying shag.

How Conservatives Won the Heart of America	Books	2	24	40	N	N	Overrated and under-researched	I began this book with enthusiasm, because as a moderately liberal Democrat I was heartbroken at the results of the last two elections. Basically I agree with the premise that Republicans have exploited social issues like abortion to get working class voters to support tax cuts for the wealthy and other issues that are against their own self-interest. <br /> <br />However, this book is very poorly researched and entirely lacking in footnotes or any kind of background for the situations that Mr. Frank describes. He is basically preaching to the converted here -- to liberals who just don't understand why they fail repeatedly to capture the hearts and minds of the American public. <br /> <br />Some of the issues explored in the book, in and of themselves (like the abortion issue as it applies to conservative voters) deserve very much to be thoroughly researched and discussed. WHY is this a hot button issue? Why has it exploded in controversy when for most Americans this kind of sexual privacy issue was settled decades ago? Why is it a linchpin issue for conservative voters,when it doesn't even remotely apply to most of their lives? However,\\"What's The Matter With Kansas\\" doesn't do much more than skate over the issue, although correctly identifying it as a major stumbling block. <br /> <br />There IS a cultural divide in this country and it IS getting worse, with the sides more polarized than any time I recall since the Vietnam War left us in camps designated \\"Hawks\\" or \\"Doves\\" and never would the twain meet. Enlightened politicans like Hillary Clinton appear to be actively working to bridge this gap and make meaningful dialogue, even with those on the opposite political pole. Unlike Mr. Frank, who seems to merely want to flail around, angrily denouncing anyone who doesn't see things his own (sometimes rather myopic and one-sided)way. <br /> <br />It is pretty much worthless in any political discussion to simply label the opposition \\"stupid\\" or blind. I think ordinarypeople are generally quite intelligent about what really matters to them the most. If Democrats and liberals have failed, they have failed because they are not truly listening to the public and seeing how they might SERVE and not merely lead. <br /> <br />The present political situation (Oct.

Of course it's ridiculously long and passionate, but Forever Amber has to be one of the most compulsive reads ever. The ending robs the reader of that frantically needed happy ending when we realise that Amber will never be anything more to Bruce Carlton (the sexiest man ever to exist in literature)than a humble peasant, although, agonisingly, we, the readers know that Amber is so much more. The book probably could be shorter and yet, i didn't want it to end. Who didn't want Amber to cause chaos in America? If you liked GWTW then you would love this- i would also recommend 'Through A Glass Darkly'. Forever Amber also has to be one of the greatest historical novels ever written- the authenticity of characters is heightened by the careful web of real figures and events from history with an epic love story entangled like a document rather than a narrative. This is a book that if the reader enjoys, shall never leave them. The ending in particular invokes the audience to continue believing and hoping in Amber's quest to win Bruce Carlton. To summarise, Forever Amber is a twisted, passionate, addictive, living tale that embodies every possible theme, character and love that you could imagine.	2005-10-10

I had just completed the standard physics undergraduate E&M two semester course when I purchased this book.  I had earlier purchased the classic Jeffimenko's textbook \\"Electricity and Magnetism\\"  as one of my backup books to help me through the course.  I found that book to be very useful and realized that Jefimenko's vector analysis (calculus) treatment of the subject was extensive and his tables and derivations of vector equations provided details that were missing or assumed intuitively obvious in the text I was using for my E&M course.  (It should be pointed out as well that the so called Jefimenko Equations derived in his original text provide a powerful coordinate free expression for Electric and Magnetic fields in which electromagnetic radiation or propagation is directly manifest in the terms.  Feynman provides a similar equation in his Physics Lectures vol II. textbook and also by Heaviside in early days of wireless.)  So I was expecting good things from his new book. <br /> <br />The first chapters of his new book, using retardation vector equations, develops the E&M transformation equations and serves to update his original texbook which ended with a chapter on radiation.  However, things go wrong starting with chapter 10, \\"The Rate of Moving Clocks.\\"  Here, Jefimenko takes the principle of relativity as developed in the previous chapter and applies them to various \\"thought experiment\\" type clocks.  These experiments are labeled, clock#1 through clock#12.  A given clock number corresponds to a certain simple geometric configuration of fixed charges or fixed charge distribution in a specific moving frame such as a charged ring and a single point charge that is free to oscillate in the field produced by the fixed charges.  Example:  A negative charge oscillating in a plane perpendicular and equidistant to two positive charges moving parallel to the x-axis.  (Because this is a thought experiment, it is assumed that the free charge is constrained by invisiblefrictionless guides to oscillate in the perpendicular plane so that it cannot be trapped by either of the fixed charges.)  For these clocks, the single frictionless oscillating charge is a counter that serves as an accurate time keeping mechanism. <br /> <br />The idea is to figure out how the oscillating charge changes frequency when the whole clock is moving at relativistic speed with respect to a \\"stationary\\" observer.  The first six clocks defined by Jefimenko are called \\"Einsteinian Clocks\\" because they behave exactly as defined by the Special Theory of Relativity and slow down with respect to the observer when traveling at relativistic speeds.  Clocks 7 through 12 are called \\"Non-Einsteinian Clocks\\" because although they slow down, they do not follow the time dilation factor given by Einstein.  Jeffimenko is attempting to used these thought experiments as a way to show that time dilation is not dependent solely on relativistic velocity and that the effect is really explained through an analogy to retardation and is therefore not really a relativistic effect at all (Page 262). <br /> <br />In the text, clock#3 (Einsteinian) is the same as clock#7 (Non-Einsteinian) except that clock#7 is moving in a direction perpendicular to the direction specified for clock#3.  At first when I looked at this, Jeffimenko's argument and equations looked correct.  However, I noticed that for clock#7 he did not take into effect the Lorentz contraction of the fixed charges in the system.  When I made this change I got the same results for time dilation as clock#3 and in perfect agreement with Einstein.   <br /> <br />I can see no reason to ignore the Lorentz contraction, so I conclude that this represents a serious flaw in Jefimenko's analysis.  However, this book might be worth purchasing for the footnotes and bibliography at the end of each chapter.  Jefimenko references many papers written by all the famous players of E&M theory.  This provides a cornicopia of information for the person interested in following the early history and development of E&M and also the controversy that surrounded this early development. <br /> <br />Jack <br />	2005-10-10

McBeth has laid a good foundation if you are interested Baptist History.  The only problem I have found is McBeth allows his own personal views to skew what he calls history and what he has decided to include in this book.  Rather than giving a full account of what History says about Baptist, McBeth tells most of the story.  Other than that, VERY well written and easy to read.  Don't be intimidated by the number of pages.  McBeth focuses on a few things that you can skip and not miss anything.  Hope you enjoy reading this book and will look further into history.  McBeth mentions a good book to give you another side of Baptist History; \\"The Trail Of Blood\\".  It is out of print but you can still find some copies out there.  While it also is not exact it gives you another side.  Good Luck and God Bless!	2005-10-10

Hall exams how people interact and how they live together. He begins with an examination of the animal world and how animals share space. Although not directly related to humans it is interesting to know that crowding among rats leads to massive population decline.<br /><br />The book also deals with cultural differences in the use of space. Hall examines the French, German, English, Japanese, and Arab world comparing each with the American context and with one another. The concluding chapters look at the modern world and seek to explain the ways in which we must design our cities to reflect proxemics values. This is even more valuable advice today as American seeks to integrate more and more immigrants from very different cultures.<br /><br />Although a little dated this book is worth a read.	2005-10-10
