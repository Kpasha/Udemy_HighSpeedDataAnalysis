US	46008310	R207RTV3HOTUB8	1590473787	436367693	SAS Functions by Example	Books	2	18	26	N	Y	Too simple too Narrow	This may be a good reference book if your entire SAS experiences have been or will be dealing with text characters without any messy computation or you have never and will never write your own code based on new algorithms like what we are encountering everyday in academic under the supervision of innovative professors, or if your entire job is exclusive to handle one or two SAS procedures.     If your job or your mind is not so boring, then this book is probably NOT a good reference. A simple example, after you read the whole book, you DO NOT know how to find the probability, say P(X<=x), of a particular distribution X given x, nor could you know how to find a quartile. Even though this book emphasizes on functions dealing with characters, you will not know from this book how to put together two character variables. The author put a whole chapter telling you how to generate Normal and Uniform random variables while didn't bother to enumerate the ways to generate other distributions. You do not know how to generate a binomial or a Poisson or a Gamma or a Beta or a Chi-square ... I can hardly imagine what these SAS experts are doing everyday with SAS? We do not need a book or a whole chapter of a book to learn how to create Normal or Uniform distribution. A Google search gives more comprehensive results than Mr. Cody's whole chapter. What we need for a reference book is a complete list of all available SAS random variable generating functions which takes less than one page, which will save readers a great deal of time on no-clue searching, which is exactly what a reference book all about, and which unfortunately is exactly what this book has failed to do. A GOOD reference book should go even more beyond. In addition to the complete list, a friendly author would also let readers know how to indirectly generate some distributions that could not be generated directly by existing SAS functions, Inverse Gamma is a good starting point since it is very popular in the Bayesian computation while no SAS function can create it directly.     Lacking of both basic and very useful functions is particularly not acceptable for this book because allegedly it has been especially designed to serve for any level SAS users.     Today there are tons of people who claim they are SAS professionals, have been using SAS for xyz years. I personally know a handful of them. Most of them fall into one of the following categories:   1. Doing exclusive with SAS data step, and not familiar with anything else;   2. Working with one or two SAS proc's, and not knowing anything else;   3. Displaying SAS graphs in a fashion way, and not knowing anything else.   4. Adding some lines to existing SAS programs routinely, and thus believing he is an experienced SAS programmer, even though he is highly unlikely to know how to write a simple code on his own, for example to compute the sum of integers from 1 to 100, without using Data step.   .....     Those people have hardly exposed to anything outside their narrow and exclusive SAS environment and if those people say well to this book, you make your own decision.	2005-10-10

This tale of two odd-couple type sisters trying to share the same apartment while dealing with family drama, was really great.  Asha is a free spirit who is really upfront with everybody she meets...all she wants is money, the more the better.  She is also a realist who understands that everything is not always black or white, good or bad.  Sometimes things just are what they are.  Saundra is a real nitwit who would have been a hippie if she'd been born a few decades ago.  She is also very immature for a 22 year old and needs a lot of babying and hand holding.  When Asha's lover commits suicide, she gets a lecture from Saundra on the workings of Karma.  When Asha has a one night stand, Saundra primly lectures her on morality.  It was a miracle that Asha did not throw Saundra into the streets before the end of this book.  The men in their lives, Yero - Randall - Nick - Phil are all well drawn characters who are not stereotypical at all.  I especially liked Phil, the tortured father.  He tried so hard to be \\"respectable\\" and had to learn the hard way that everyone just has to be himself in order to find true happiness.  This book is a must read!	2005-10-10

She explains things very well and offers helpful tips. Many of the recipes are very inexpensive, too.  In addition, most of the recipes don't have big long ingredient lists, which is a big plus in my opinion. And they're not loaded with fat, either. Yet they still taste wonderful. My two favorites are the parsnip soup (which I never would've expected to like!) and the butternut squash with lime, garlic and ginger. I can't praise this book enough.	2005-10-10

Beware the well-intentioned mistakes of our ancestors. The following is from \\"The River War,\\" Churchill's first hand account of the military campaign to \\"retake\\" the Sudan from Islamic extremists --<br /><br />What enterprise that an enlightened community may attempt is more noble and more profitable than the reclamation from barbarism of fertile regions and large populations? To give peace to warring tribes, to administer justice where all was violence, to strike the chains off the slave, to draw the richness from the soil, to plant the earliest seeds of commerce and learning, to increase in whole peoples their capacities for pleasure and diminish their chances of pain --- what more beautiful ideal or more valuable reward can inspire human effort? The act is virtuous, the exercise invigorating, and the result often extremely profitable. Yet as the mind turns from the wonderful cloudland of aspiration to the ugly scaffolding of attempt and achievement, a succession of opposite ideas arise. Industrious races are displayed stinted and starved for the sake of an expensive Imperialism that they can only enjoy if they are well fed. Wild peoples, ignorant of their barbarism, callous of suffering, careless of life but tenacious of liberty, are seen to resist with fury the philanthropic invaders, and to perish in thousands before they are convinced of their mistake. The inevitable gap between conquest and dominion becomes filled with the figures of the greedy trader, the inopportune missionary, the ambitious soldier, the lying speculator, who disquiet the minds of the conquered and excite the sordid appetites of the conquerors.  And as the eye of thought rests on these sinister features, it hardly seems possible for us to believe that any fair prospect is approached by so foul a path.e the sordid appetites of the conquerors.

Originally written in draft form around the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, Ha Jin's novel recreates those tumultuous times and the forces which built up and exploded in student protest--the stifling of true inquiry and creativity, institutionalized adherence to old-style, hard line bureaucracy, and an all-powerful state which manipulates every aspect of a person's destiny, from education and career path to place of residency and choice of spouse. With candor and a sense of immediacy, Ha Jin illuminates the pressures and frustrations of Chinese academic life, as seen by Jian Wan, studying for his Ph.D. entrance exams in literature, and by Prof. Yang, his mentor and academic advisor.<br /><br />When Prof. Yang, who is also Jian Wan's future father-in-law, suffers a serious stroke, Jian Wan is the one who must tend him in the hospital. Half-crazed and irrational, Prof. Yang has moments of lucidity in which he speaks urgently to Jian and offers heartfelt advice, but most often Jian finds him singing songs from his childhood, recalling nightmarish events from the long-buried past, and reliving conversations and recent events which have dramatically affected both his personal relationships and his career.<br /><br />As Jian listens to Prof. Yang, he finds himself examining his own life and goals with a more critical and discerning eye, becoming more and more disillusioned by the injustices he sees all around him, both within the academic community and in the countryside, where poverty is still rampant, the people are utterly powerless, and life is a hopeless search for a way out.<br /><br />Filled with fascinating insights into the nature of life in a totalitarian state, the novel is both moving and enlightening, though it is sometimes didactic. In clear, efficient prose which avoids all frills and flourishes, Jian tells his story in the first person. The scope expands as the maunderings of Prof. Yang, along with his symbolic stories and recollections, reveal the history of the Chinese Revolution in personal terms.<br /><br />Numerous aphorisms constantly remind the reader of the universality of the characters' observations and of the author's themes: \\"We're all automatons without a soul,\\" \\"Intellect makes life insufferable. It's better to be an ordinary man working honorably with your hands,\\" \\"As a scholar, you're just a piece of meat on a chopping board,\\" and \\"I want to take my fate in my own hands...I want to be a knife instead of a piece of meat.\\"  The dramatic conclusion, full of ironies, is a bit preachy in its message, but few will fail to be moved by scenes from the Tiananmen Square massacre, which provides dramatic and powerful imagery of a China which will \\"devour her children to sustain herself.

To illustrate how change occurs he mentions a piece of meat as it is cooking. If left unattended, when will the meat cease to be meat?<br /><br />In places he gets bogged down in jargon and complexity. He starts by discussing education in general, noting that in addition to English, a student should study French and Latin, that certain things can only be known though the original tongue of the author.

Smith relies heavily on dialogue that is unrealistic, clunky, and detracts from both the narrative threads and character development.  Her grasps of American English is tenuous at best, especially her portrayal of \\"street\\" talk and even her use of academic language.  Furthermore, her characters' voices lack consistency and constantly contradict themselves in tone and cadence.  That said, the plot is fairly engaging, in particular the story line that follows Harold Belsey through a mid-life crisis.  Perhaps in the future Smith should stick to a world that she knows and understands, as well as employ an adequate copy editor.

Have read it at least four times, usually on long flights above the ocean or across a country. Here are its five principal lessons: <br /> <br />Desired outcome after reading: <br />Accomplish more by finding a better balance between effort and ease. <br /> <br />1. Trade what you have for what you want <br />\\"At any moment, your life is completely full... You had twenty four hours yesterday, and I guarantee that you used every minute and second of it.\\" To make your life today different than it was yesterday, you have to give up something to make room for activities that will bring you what you desire. \\"Often, the greater the reward, the larger the adjustment you will have to make in your life.\\" <br /> <br />2. Change your dreams, change your life <br />\\"Your dreams are like a movie projector reflecting your conscious and unconscious thoughts. If you want to know the quality of your life, examine the quality of your dreams.\\" Do whatever you can to push your dreams to new levels: cut out pictures from magazines, imagine that you are (not will be, but are right now) wildly successful. Take long, imaginary rides in your yacht or Ferrari. <br /> <br />3. Surrender, and see your destiny <br />Giving into destiny does not mean doing nothing. It means \\"accepting life as you find it. It means using your given ability, talent and strength to do all you can to bring about a better life for yourself and others.\\" She believes destiny reveals itself in three stages: first, you are dissatisfied with life; next, you come to some dramatic turning point - be careful not to get stuck here, as many do; finally you recognize that no one can take away what is destined to be yours, and then you have much in common with other great men and woemn.  <br /> <br />4. Be willing not to survive <br />Once you turn to face the worst of all consequences, fear disappears. Death can actually become your protector. Once you accept death and turn to face it, daily stress and frustration drifts away. You gain the freedom to recognize what is truly important, rather than what you feel compelled to do. <br /> <br />5. Put your mind at ease <br />\\"The only reality that exists for you is in your own mind.\\" Grant yourself grace. You can choose to enjoy or dread your ride through life; this is a choice that happens in your mind, not in the world around you.	2005-10-10

You can't step into your backyard without treading on interlopers, like the favored Kentucky bluegrass.<br /><br />From the hallucinogenic properties of hemp, morning glory, datura and more; to attempts to cultivate the silkworm; to rats, cockroaches and disease, Leland's essays offer an entertaining history of facts, rumors and squabbles on an exhaustive number of alien species. Whether purposely (often to rid the place of some other unwanted interloper) or accidentally introduced, aliens have long thrived in their new home and many have come to be considered natives.<br /><br />A professor of English at the Virginia Military Institute, Leland (\\"Porcher's Creek: Lives Between the Tides\\") writes with wit and a certain wicked relish, and his research is dizzyingly thorough. But the sheer width and breadth of information is overwhelming. This is a book to keep, to dip into again and again a chapter or even a few pages at a time, so as to have some hope of retention.<br /><br />With chapter titles like \\"Out of Africa,\\" \\"Cowboys: And Their Alien Habits,\\" \\"It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time,\\" and \\"Bioterror: Older than You Think,\\" Leland makes an appreciative and entertaining case for the melting pot.	2005-10-10

It only makes it more complicated, not less. <br /> <br />Second, it shifts the tax burden to the middle class who have to spend more of a percentage of income on goods.  <br /> <br />Third, it reduces consumer spending, thus slowing the economy. <br /> <br />Fourth, this notion of &#8220;it is the people who work hard benefit&#8221; is nonsense. I make a pretty good living. But I know that there are a lot of Americans out there making minimum wage who work a lot harder than I do. So, lets dispense with the notion that Americans who don&#8217;t make as much don&#8217;t work as hard. <br /> <br />Fifth, it is very difficult to police this. The is much more room for tax evasion as seen with state sales tax. Decentralizing the tax scheme will only lead to more fraud. <br /> <br />Sixth, it does nothing to hold the government more accountable. We know how much they spend now and on what they spend it. A sales tax won&#8217;t change government waste. <br /> <br />Seventh, it eliminates the tax advantages for investment in Municipal Bonds. Municipalities would never be able to compete, thus drying up investment in our local infrastructure OR, you end up paying more in tax dollars to pay higher interest rates. <br /> <br />Eighth, you have greatly overestimated the drop in overhead to banks in regards to mortgages. If any, it would be no where near 25%. Most mortgage companies operate on a very narrow margin and low overhead, and they only pay corporate tax on the net profits. And since companies operate with a consumption base as a gross income write off, this would eat up any additional saving. <br /> <br />Ninth, no estate tax? yeah, because Bill Gate&#8217;s great grandchildren will have worked really hard for those billions that get passed down. <br /> <br />There are many more reasons, but that is just a few why the &#8220;fair tax&#8221; is a recipe for disaster.	2005-10-10
US	38061364	R539NOS30Y1D3	0735712018	50666649	Designing With Web Standards	Books	1	397	496	N	N	Commits the very sins it condemns	I came upon this book via glowing reviews on amazon, citations on websites, and exalted praise from cutting-edge web developers. This was THE book to read if you want to build websites that didn't rely on spaghetti code and deeply nested tables, I was told.  <br /> <br />I was greatly disappointed. While I appreciate the overall message of this book and some of the techniques are helpful, not only is it exasperating in its lack of information, but it actually commits the very sins that it relentlessly cites as the scourge of 99.9% of websites - redundancy, verbosity, and lack of clean, clear structure of what little information it imparts. <br /> <br />-REDUNDANCY AND VERBOSITY GALORE <br />The book really doesn't even get started until Chapter 6 on page 153 (and even that is being generous), after mind-numbing repetition in the form of exposition, bulleted lists, and executive summaries about why one should design and build websites using web standards. There's even a sentence on page 137 that proclaims, \\"Now let's stop exulting and get down to work.\\" Well, guess what? It's just a tease - and there will be plenty more -- because the proselytizing never really stops. <br /> <br />When the author finally comes around to showing examples and their accompanying markup, it is sadly deficient. CSS that works with the markup is not even shown alongside it, although we are promised to be shown in another chapter. I learned very little about how to actually employ the techniques that Zeldman advocates so strenuously. <br /> <br />The meaningless subheads drove me nuts! Here's a taste: \\"CSS: The First Bag is Free; The F Word; How Suite it is; Not a Panacea, But Plays One on TV; Inherit the Wind; Miss Behavior to You.\\" I know this might seem like a petty criticism, and maybe people are used to this style from the Dummies books, but 1. They're stupid 2. They impart absolutely no meaning, so if the book is used for a reference, they are less than helpful and 3. The subsectionsare constantly referred to in all of their absurd and useless glory. This constant reference to other sections by Chapter Number, Chapter Name, Subsection Name smacked of gratuitous page lengthening to me. (If you must refer, why not just use page numbers? Takes up about 1/10th of the space (LIKE GOOD WEB CODE), or better yet, use footnotes!)  <br /> <br />-CRINGE-MAKING BANTER   <br />Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I don't get this stuff. I bought a serious, technical book about the new age of coding websites. It cost $35 and at 415 pages, that's about 8.4 cents per page. I don't need breaks for mindless digressions about blueberry tofu pie, what title you were thinking of for chapter 6, or for that matter why you want to write in the first person plural. At times, Mr. Zeldman seems to almost flaunt it in our face that he's wasting our time, e.g., on pg. 214 (after a discussion of how this isn't a CSS manual, and how he's introducing us to the \\"thighs\\" and \\"drumsticks\\" of CSS), he writes: \\"On the other hand, how many full-blown CSS reference manuals use the word \\"thighs\\" three times in one paragraph? You're right none of them do. Your money was well spent on this book.\\"  <br /> <br />And when he does actually explain something, it's like being hit over the head with a jackhammer.  It took more than half of page 159 to explain this XHTML rule: \\"write all tags in lowercase\\".  <br /> <br />-BAD TEACHING <br />The book is also sprinkled with pointless putdowns like \\"none of this is rocket science\\" (pg. 164), but the most egregious teaching technique occurs on page 196, when, mind you, very little actual teaching has even taken place. The author gives an example of markup from the Microsoft homepage (eek!) of what he calls \\"toilet debris\\" code and then goes on to say: <br /> <br />\\"Because redundancy is as bad in books as it is in code, we'll avoid explaining what's wrong with this markup. If you don't know by now, one of us hasn't done our job.\\" <br /> <br />Should the phrase \\"we'll avoid explaining\\" ever be part an educational text? With all due respect Mr.Zeldman, I think it's you who didn't do your job. <br />	2005-10-10

Yet, this in-depth understanding of the man and his accomplishments does not slow down the pace of the book.  Peter is able to keep the fruits of his exaustive research in a supporting role, never letting it impeed or slow the velocity of Alexander's story, which is fitting.  Peter provides just enough detail to explain the importance of each of Alexander's actions and how they were achieved.  This is important because I really didn't believe so much insight could be packed into such a small book.  Another point, Peter firmly roots Alexander in Macedonia, with its history, politics, traditions and expectations of leadership.  Quickly, the reader comes to view the situation as a Macedonian, not a Greek.  This distinction is important in understanding Alexander in context of his historical period and cultural background.  Given Peter's preparation, the reader will understand that Alexander could become a god in the eyes of his contemporaries, given his unsurpassed military and political accomplishments.  I will leave the superlatives to Peter. Within twenty pages you will know in detail that Alexander was superbly prepared for greatness.  In another twenty, how Alexander turned his excellent preparation into an unmatched string of victories.  Never once does the author loose sight of the man himself.  If Alexander seems unapproachable and on a pedestal, it is because he deserves to be there.  Peter's genious is to avoid the inclination to dislodge Alexander.  Instead, Peter tries to bring us up to Alexander's level and into his world.<br /><br />This could possibly be the only book on Alexander the historian or student of military art ever needs.	2005-10-10

The author - and translator -  have managed a perfect journey, not very pretty, into the world of a South African version of poor white trash. The characters' lives are like the town they live in - built on destruction with God know what lying rotting under the surface.   As I read I was almost desperate to find something, anything, to like about the characters.  The few moments when that happened were rain in the desert.  Sweet, relieving, and over very quickly.  <br />  <br />  This book is a slice of life written well enough to make it quite real.

US	15929764	R2XUTCRAJAP2J9	1567512526	687427378	Killing Hope: U.S. Military and C.I.A. Interventions Since World War II--Updated Through 2003	Books	5	30	39	N	N	Impeccably sourced, a MUST READ for Americans	I fashion myself to be a political history expert, and I have a Master's Degree on the subject, but there's stuff in this book that even surprised me.  Everything that we see on TV today in relation to Iraq and the War on Terror is not new.  Torture, subversion of sovereign governments, execution of leftists, funding of illicit, ex-Nazis or Nazi-associated organizations, etc, the U.S. did it all,  all for fighting the Communists, even when the evidence available proved that in many cases, the Communist bogeyman was used where it wasn't present.  Today, substitute Terrorist for Communist, but the same tactics are applied. <br /> <br />This books goes a long way toward answering those deep, but important questions: \\"Why do they hate us?  Are we truly a force for democracy?  Do we even know how to export it, based on our past record?  Unless someone is morally depraved or holds a closet view that the U.S., by some unexplainable supreme right, should rule the world at its leisure, this book will come as a shocker and will provoke reflection.  Any American who values the Founders' values, equality, fair play, and true freedom will become horrified at what their goverment's agencies have done for over 100 years and more (this book covers the post-1945 era). <br /> <br />The intent is not to \\"hate\\" on America, but rather provide a historical background to the reader so that they don't become unthinking, pro-war, pro-goverment, pro-jingoist drones.  After reading this book, it would become almost impossible to be a war-consenting citizen.  The only warning on this book is that you must be prepared to be a cynic and a dissident of American foreign policy, because the evidence is so overwhelmingly negative that one becomes opposed to what this goverment has done and continues to do.  That is, of course, if you have some basic sense of morality and fairplay.  If you're looking to build up your imperial ideology, please look up books by prominent neoconservatives.  If you planto educate yourself so that you can educate others and make sure this never happens again, this is the book for you.  REQUIRED READING FOR ALL AMERICANS.	2005-10-10

I've followed Zahn for a while, and given good reviews to a substantial number of his other books, because I enjoy them and they seem not to get much recognition on amazon.com.  I've said often how I buy each one as soon as it comes out, knowing I'll get a fairly formulaic but also extremely exciting romp with some very clever plot twists. <br /> <br />Well, outside of \\"formulaic\\", none of that describes this one.  It seems like Zahn took the first half of The Icarus Hunt, perhaps my favorite of his, and removed all trace of humor and cleverness, then replaced the second half with something cliched and constantly, irritatingly predictable.  Truly - the setup is EXACTLY the same, from the narrator having a shady job that the reader is not told, to a powerful and mysterious alien race controlling all of the transportation in the galaxy, to the main character recieving a job that is clearly more than it appears from someone with a hidden agenda, etc, etc.  It does eventually go somewhere different from Icarus, but not somewhere good - instead, we're treated to a series of staggeringly easy to predict plot twists, resulting in a climax that, while somewhat enjoyable, is nowhere near Zahn's usual standards. <br /> <br />Also, the Big Secret hanging over the story - what the narrator's original occupation was (this is constantly referenced in little side-comments, like \\"Serving two masters is indeed possible, so I decided to take the second job\\" and \\"I was actually making progress on my original job, too, in a twisted way\\") - turns out to be nothing more than, essentially, a punchline, revealed on the last page (though I'd figured it out well before).  Compared to Icarus Hunt, where this same setup produced the greatest final plot twist I've ever seen...well, calling it \\"disappointing\\" is extremely mild. <br /> <br />Zahn is a fantastic adventure sci-fi author.  I highly reccomend Icarus Hunt or Angelmass or Warhorse, or the Conquerors Trilogy.  Do not spend money on thisbook.	2005-10-10

Now, I feel like a have a much much better understanding of why history played out the way it did.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about american history.  My only complaints are:  1)  The book does get a little tedious at times (but I never read a history book that wasn't) and 2) the author deals with 1776 and 1776 alone.  I would have appreciated a little pre-1776 history and post 1776 history to help me gain some context for the events in the book (But this might not be important to those readers who already have a strong grasp on american history)	2005-10-10

Much of the Quranic verses are connected with incidents and events that took place. Some readers generalise a verse that actually was meant for a specific people.  <br />Abu lahab was infact Mohamed's uncle who was his fierce nemesis,think of him as the bible's Caiaphas or Herod. There were many detractors & opponents of Mohamed not just his uncle. <br />Now about the verses dealing with conversion or jizya or execute, that verse is known to have dealt specifically with Quraysh Tribe & not the whole world as many claim. <br />Terrorists & fanatics use these verses to generalise them & spread their evil message to gain followers,but its not absolute, noteven with Quraysh, as upon entering Mecca, Mohamed spared the Meccans,who were his bitter enemy, the slaughter that was expected as per the verse. <br />To understand the Quran, one must also read history of that era in full details to understand many verses.  <br />There are verses that talks well of christians and jews & other verses that pour scorn, but again, it didnt generalise every single christian & jew, it meant a specific group who had done something, like the Torah condemning the egyptians for mistreating the hebrews & imagine extending it to egyptians of today. I would urge anyone to read more and not to read it with a prejudiced eye like fanatics do. The book is Helpful & throws new light over the quran but extra history reading is needed.	2005-10-10

While some history books are plagued with details ad nauseam, often producing mountains of text that can reach over 700 pages in length (Howard Zinn's \\"A People's History...\\" comes to mind), Alexander managed to keep his narrative of American history under 300 pages long.<br /><br />While most of the nation's important details are still mentioned in the book (such as the American Revolution, Louisana Purchase, westward expansion, etc.), there are several things left out from the final cut.  For instance, in the beginning of the book, there is hardly any emphasis placed on the drafting of the U.S. Constitution, yet the document still stands today as the supreme law of the United States.  Also lacking is the amount of attention the author gives to pre-Revolution America; this means that many events that had set a precedent to American secession from Britain are missing from the book.<br /><br />All things considered, with about 250 pages to work with, Alexander delivers a respectable body of research with interesting analyses to guide the reader, as well as a complete reference guide in the appendix where readers are treated to texts from inaugural addresses, document clauses, and other important historical events.<br /><br />4 of 5 stars.	2005-10-10

The actors interpretations are neither over-done nor under-done. If the remaining plays are as good, this production of the totality of the plays is a gift to scholars and to groundlings as well. Thank you Archangel et al.	2005-10-10

Originally published in 1949, this is still regarded as the authoritative reference on the subject, wit chapters covering botanical names, occupative names, compound names and more. Quite technical listings identify names under each category and add often extensive footnoted references: a must for any researching their Italian roots.	2005-10-10

Readers familiar with work by Bloom, Nussbaum and Slaughter and Leslie (to mention a few) will be familiar with the wailings of liberal arts protectionists.  Gieger is refreshing unemotive about such issues.  His concerns are teasing out the expression and impact of competition and consumerism in the universities over students and research.<br /><br />It is a book replete with interesting and arresting stats and arguments, and I won't pretend to do justice to it here.  However, his analysis of the connection between student retention rates, inter university competition and student consumerism will resonate with most academics' experiences of their teaching environment.  Interestingly, Gieger also mulls over the growing disconnection of research institutes from the educational core mission of universities.  The periphery and centre are no longer in communion -  a point becoming more obvious by the day.  As he points out, criticism that classroom instruction is 'falling behind' is grounded largely in the mistaken supposition that periphery and core are in communion. The weakest part of the book, in my opinion the main blemish, is the last chapter dealing with universities and the markets. It is a bit vague and rambling with the the odd dollop of personal judgement thrown into the mix.  For instance, Gieger asserts that the research market is 'beautifully efficient' (p 249).  Not everyone would agree with this statement nor that efficiency equals either value for money nor utility.  He does conclude this chapter by upbraiding the universities for not investing heavily enough in teaching, and not emphasising that a degree of insulation from commercial activity is desirable.  Nevertheless, the chapter is composed of a lot of sections beginning, Firtsly, Secondly, Thirdly, ... lending a list structure to the text suggesting a hurried approach that jars with the rest of the work.<br /><br />Overall, I found this book informative and in the main lively.

Although I am sure that there are some interesting anecdotes here about some rather idiosyncratic personalities, authoritarian personalities and science/tech nerds, the stories aren't told too tolerably well.<br /><br />Also annoying is the lack of any diagrams to describe any of the features and fundemental designs for the semiconductors. I am not talking about circuit designs, I am talking about schematic diagrams common in any well written pop-science book. If the writing was clearer the prose could stand alone even without such diagrams, but as it was I had to give up on the text after about half way through.<br /><br />In sum, the author is trying to tell a narrative history of the semiconductor. But the story just does not come off and I am left sort of shaking my head not exaclty knowing what it is I am getting from the investment of time in this book.

If you don't remember the television show, the obstacles include not knowing how to get there,  the Grumpy Old Troll, a storm cloud, icky-sticky mud, crossing Turtle River, and a closed door at the library.<br /><br />Most of these obstacles are solved with the help of Backpack and your child.  The Map shows the way, and Backpack has the supplies to solve most of the problems if they only could figure out what to use.  What Backpack can't do, you child can, by helping to point out what to use.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />What I like about this book is that there is alot to learn.  Children can learn all about maps, for example.  How they are representational of real terrain and places.<br /><br />It also lets you and your children practiced rhyming.  The Troll's quiz, for example, begs the question of what rhymes with `guizzers'?  Scissors!<br /><br />And the Backpack sequences lets children look at a collection of items, recognize their use, and then select the appropriate item.  Sort of like, Problem Solving 101.<br /><br />Also, there are many opportunities to count throughout the book, though the most obvious chance comes at the end when Dora counts to make sure that all of the books are there.<br /><br />And finally, one of my favorite things is that the story is about the Library.  Dora is associated with books and reading, thus setting a good example.<br /><br />Four Stars.  One of the better Dora books.

Some of the information contained in this manual is helpful and informative - but I also noted some marked errors. (I'm not that smart and don't pretend to be, but some of these errors are common knowledge.)   However, these discrepancies are significant in that anyone following some of these outdated guidelines could actually do much more harm than help - and in situations where the condition isn't frequently encountered - well, that's EXACTLY when someone would consult this book.   For example - in the section on toxicity - specifically theophylline toxicity, page 824-5, the guidelines are more than just plain wrong (according to some famous and well respected toxicologists and ED MDs) but would actually prevent the patient from receiving prompt and lifesaving treatment. While acute theophylline toxicity is not especially common anymore; it can be a severe, life-threatening event. In severe toxicity, emergent dialysis and potassium replacement are urgently needed, not syrup of ipecac. Syrup of ipecac/ activated charcoal is worse than useless - (since toxicity causes violent, repeated emesis- it actually exacerbates the severe hypokalemia that characterizes theophylline toxicity*.) But this is just an example of why this book REALLY needs revision and updating.   In addition - the sources listed for this section of the text show an inadequate research base for the information provided - there is not one text that refers to toxicology, or specific aspects of the toxicity related to this particular medication. It's just a nonspecific application of general treatment of most toxicities - using a basic Internal Medicine primer (used primarily by med students) and another general source. I would expect better references and resources to be used in a book like this - which serves as a resource to healthcare providers to treat people!   Without revision, it of little use to healthcare providers because information may or may not be trustworthy. Who has time to go throughthe entire book to see if the information provided meets national standards for treatment? If we had that sort of time, we wouldn't be purchasing this book.    *Note* I am happy to provide a list of references for all information relating to the pharmacology, and treatment of theophylline toxicity, and toxicology resources which served as a basis for these comments.	2005-10-10

The book doesn't add anything new to the literature on the US in North Africa, but it is well written and certainly provides a good overview of the strategic, operational, and tactical situation on the ground. His focus is on how the US Army arrived as green, but well trained, soldiers with high moral. It follows them through their initial successes, but with indicators of problems to come while fighting the French. Atkinson then proceeds to describe how the Army was severely blooded when it first came up against the Germans, but it quickly learned the profession of war. He points out that these lessons, from the common soldier up to Eisenhower, and these units formed the experienced core that went on to win the war in Europe. He also discusses at length the problems of integrating the militiaries and attitudes of the US and British armies.	2005-10-10

His name is synonymous with billions of dollars made in the money markets of the world.        With that picture of Buffet firmly imprinted in my mind, I approached The Warren Buffet Way with some trepidation: Would this book be yet another pop culture \\"How to Be a Millionaire\\" book?      Now that I've finished the book, I can confirm that this book is mandatory reading for all investors as well as all individuals who are keen on learning about value investing.      The book is extremely well written: A testament to the sheer amount of time Robert Hagstrom has spent studying Warren Buffet and Value Investing.  This book is the culmination of 20 years spent in search of a deeper understanding of the insight that Warren Buffet possesses.      From the first chapter to the last,  Hagstrom gives us a detailed view into the mind of the Sage. He, however, avoids waxing theoretical.  Every theory he espouses is immediately followed by a series of case studies spanning Coca Cola, Larson-Juhl,Geico, The Washington Post Company,General Foods, Fruit of the Loom and many more.      These concrete examples serve to illustrate and emphasise the pragmatism of Warren Buffet's way.  In a world filled with get rich quick millionaire-in-a-day schemes and self help fads, this pragmatic, research centric approach to money making is as refreshing as it is revealing.      As I progressed through the book, a picture began to develop.  As the picture filled out with colour, so did I fill up with hope and inspiration.  By the end of the book, I had a clear picture of the educational and psycho-emotional path I had to walk in order to become a Billion dollar investor.      The path is simple. It involves two major activities:      Firstly, it is an absolute necessity that one constantly reads everything about business, investment, the businesses in which you wish to invest and their respective industries.  Warren Buffet, Charlie Munger, PhilipFischer, Benjamin Graham and every other billionaire is a  voracious reader, gobbling up each and every relevant piece of information to be found.  In the book, they all insist that research is king and reading is even more important than inhaling.      Secondly, one must have keen control of their minds and emotions.  In order to avoid the trap of speculative investment, one must be willing to become an iconoclast and not be swayed by prevailing market conditions no matter how extreme.  Why is this important? Simply because the stock market governed primarily by 2 emotions: Greed and fear.  Warren Buffet therefore instructs us as follows:        [We] seek to be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are being greedy.        The World's Greatest Investor  ==============================  The Sage of Omaha is not called the World's Greatest Investor for nothing. He has consistently achieved above market index returns on his investments since 1977. His net worth was recently reported as $30 billion.      His company, Berkshire Hathaway</a>, recently had reported revenues of $74.4 billion (2004). A single share of Berkshire Hathaway stock sells for upward of $90,000.      Those credentials alone were enough to get me over the mental barrier created by old modes of thought.  His investment methods are very different from the typical cell phone wielding, fast taking wall street pundit's methodologies.      Buy a Business  ==============================  The most important difference between his approach and the typical speculator is his emphasis on ownership of a business.  You do not buy stocks\shares, you buy a company.  This turns out to be a very important point.        An individual who buys shares, and views that as the end all, completely misses the context of the investment.  On the other hand, an individual who views that investment in stock as a incremental processes of buying the business,  examines the full context of the investment and is keen to observe business fundamentals.  It is this difference that determines the results one achieves in the money market.  The former approach is fraught with failure at worst and below market index returns at best.  The later approach ensures large long term returns on investment.      The Basic Tenets  ==============================  Buffet's methodology can be summarised by highlighting the basic tenets of investment. These tenets fall into 4 groups:      Business Tenets  ==============================  These are the basic characteristics of the business itself. The business tenets focus on how the business operates.  They are:    1. Is the business simple and understandable?  2. Does the business have a consistent operating history?  3. Does the business have favourable long term prospects      Understanding and utilizing the business tenets requires that one commits large amounts of time to understand every relevant aspect of the business and the industry in which it operates.  In order to achieve this high level of competency, it is necessary to limit the scope of investigation and investment to a small number of companies.  This necessitates a focused portfolio instead of a diversified one.      Management Tenets  ------------------  These refer to the quality of management.  They include:    1. Is the management rational?  Rationality, here, refers to the proclivity to make decisions in the best interest of the shareholders and based on available information.  This boils down to allocation of the company's capital which, over time, determines shareholder value.      The two possible decisions to be made when allocating company earnings are:    - Reinvest in the business.  - Return money to shareholders.      The choice taken when allocating company earnings should be the one that ensures that an above average return on equity can be achieved.  Management that does not behave n such a manner cannot be considered rational.    2. Is management candid with shareholders?  Does management admit its faults publicly or is it secretive about problems the failures of the company as a whole?    3. Does management resist the institutional imperative?  Once a large company in an industry begins to fail, it is often the case that a number of other companies in the same industry follow suit.  This is not because they all conspire to fail but because of management's inability to resist the temptation to follow the herd of sheep as they rush to the slaughter house.      Management must be willing to be contrarian and iconoclastic.  They must be able to think independently of fads or trends and trust their own judgment.       Financial Tenets  -----------------  These refer to the mathematical and accounting aspects of the business. Warren Buffett instructs us to resist the usage of weekly or even monthly averages.  The only useful averages for a value investor are for periods spanning four or five years.      The points to consider are:    1. Focus on the return on equity [1], not earnings per share  2. Calculate owner earnings[2] to get a true reflection of value  3  Look for companies with high profit margins[3].  The key to this is maintaining low costs. To quote Warren Buffett:      The really good manager does not wake up in the morning and say \\"This is the day I'm going to cut costs\\", any more than he wakes up and decides to practice breathing.      3. The company must generate $1 of value for every dollar of retained earnings  If retained earnings are invested in the company and produce above-average return, the proof will be a proportionally greater rise in the company's market value.  This value, should again be evaluated over a four to five year period.  This is necessary as stock prices can oscillate greatly within a single year.  This variation is often due to factors other than market fundamentals.      Value Tenets  -------------  Warren Buffett makes the following distinction:      Price is what you pay.  Value is what you get.      This is the essence of the value tenets.  Contrary to popular opinion, the stock market is not efficient.  The result of this inefficiency is that the market price of a company does not instantaneously reflect the value of a company given all available information.         The stock market establishes price.  The investor determines value after weighing all the known information about the company's business, management and financial traits.  Price and value are not necessarily equal.        Value Investing  ---------------  Value investing therefore involves rational decision making based on:    1. Determine the value of the business.  2. Difference between price and value. Buy low (at a discount) or don't buy at all.      Conclusion  ==========  This book represents a sharp departure from the current self help craze.  It offers a pragmatic and well researched presentation of a solid investment philosophy.        Describing The Warren Buffet Way as a theory is no injustice.  In as much as theory is a description of how the world works, The Warren Buffet Way is a description of how investment works.      This book is ideal for the green investment novice as well as the weathered stock market veteran.  It serves as the perfect introduction to a world fraught with confusion and littered with untruths.  For the weathered veteran it provides a sharp reminder that  investment is not a complex activity.  It requires only that one take the time to find the real value of a business and then to buy the business (or a share in the business) at a discount.    What could be simpler?      Notes  =======  1. Return on equity refers to the profits attributable (net earnings minus cost of capital) to shareholders expressed as a percentage of shareholder equity.      Shareholder equity refers to the amount of value shareholders have invested in a business.  It is the fixed assets plus the current assets less current liabilities, long term creditors and provisions.    2. Owner earnings is a value coined by Warren Buffet. He recommends usage of this value instead of cash flow(net income after tax, depreciation, depletion, amortization and other non cash charges.)      Owner earnings, on the other hand takes into account capital expenditure(money that must be spent on new equipment, plant upgrades and other improvements in order to maintain its economic position and unit volume).      Owner earnings can be calculated thus: net income plus depreciation, depletion and amortization, less capital expenditure and any additional working capital needed. (note that calculating future capital expenditures requires estimates)      3. Profit margin is profits as a percentage of sales.  Note that sales refers to sales less cost of sales.	2005-10-10

Johnson, author of one of my personal favorites _Mind Wide Open_, argues that video games and TV are actually growing more complex and demanding far more cognitively from players and watchers. With video games, he leaks the little secret that no one who has never played today's video games--especially their critics--do not know: video games are fiendishly difficult. In playing a few with my five-year-old, I realize that I use problem solving and decision making skills that even the most demanding novels don't require. As for TV, he argues that shows like _The West Wing_, _Arrested Development_, and _The Simpsons_ rival literary novels in their complexity and the cognitive work they demand. Ultimately though he says the true measure of popular culture's edifying effects is not looking at high brow programming but comparing yesterday's \\"crap\\" to today's. He proceeds to do so by comparing \\"The Apprentice\\" to the \\"Love Boat\\" and finds evidence to support his claims. I enjoyed this book a great deal but felt his examples are very carefully chosen: he carefully avoids writing about today's real \\"crap\\", such as \\"Fear Factor\\" and the like, and he focuses on cognitively-demanding virtual quest video games and GOD games while avoiding more simplistic fare, such as racing and sports games that require little thought or strategy.	2005-10-10

(It's amusing that even at this brief length, Williams still feels a bit wordy.  This very short book has a few passages that could have been cut with no real loss.)  Caliban has, many years later, finally found his way off the island where Prospero left him and, cheated of revenge by Prospero's death, has instead sought out Miranda to tell his story to, after which he intends to kill her. <br /> <br />From this device, Williams gives another perspective on the events of 'The Tempest', as well as the earlier story of Caliban and Sycorax arriving on the island, Caliban's life alone after the death of Sycorax, and Caliban's early encounters with Prospero and Miranda.  The story is nicely told, with language that feels appropriate to the character.  This is a Caliban who does indeed know how to curse, but also how to explain why his curses are justified by what he sees as betrayal from both Prospero and Miranda.  <br /> <br />The ending is a bit weak, with a clever, but not really persuasive, device used to prevent the promised final and fatal confrontation.  The book is still, overall, a genuine pleasure to read.	2005-10-10

The problem is that the landing becomes the shorthand for the entire campaign in France, as if once the troops were off the beaches the fierce fighting was over and all that was left was the dash to Berlin.  In reality, Hitler threw everything he could at these forces with the intent of pushing them back into the sea.  He understood that once a breakout occurred, it would be all but impossible to stop their advance towards Berlin.  Montgomery expected the Nazi forces to pull back across the Seine and reform their defenses there.  Instead, Hitler threw most of the available Nazi forces at the British and Canadian positions in what became a fierce stalemate.  Eisenhower, putting perspective on this fighting in the Caen sector said, \\"ten feet gained on the Caen sector was equivalent to a mile elsewhere.\\" (Pg 311)<br /><br />There is debate whether Montgomery intended his troops to be in an awful and bloody stalemate while only telling his forces they were there to break through the Nazi line, or whether he really hoped for a breakout that never materialized.  In either case, the fierce fighting by these British and Canadian forces absorbed so much of the Nazi effort that it allowed Patton and his fabulous 3rd Army to break out and perform his breakthrough further down the line of the fighting like a running back going around the crush of the lines to an open field.<br /><br />The author of this amazing book, George G. Blackburn, was there as a young artillery officer during this fighting as part of an artillery regiment that moved, set-up, and fired 25 pounder cannon to support the ground forces.  Do not think for a moment that this was not harrowing and exhausting duty.  The enemy desperately wanted these guns disabled and was relentless in trying to destroy these men and their equipment.  As on officer, he also describes in vivid detail his first turn as a FOO (Forward Observation Officer).  These are the brave men who go to the front and direct the fire of the canon onto the targets.  The casualty rate for this duty is almost total and the bravery of some of these officers in standing out in the open directing tank fire onto targets is beyond understanding.<br /><br />While it is certainly true that those of us who have never been in combat can never know what it is like, particularly in the kind of ferocious fighting and massed conflict documented in this book, but that argument is also a truism.  Books are written to convey knowledge to another and are valuable because they allow us to know things other than those we directly experience.  This book is so forcefully written with descriptions that are so immediate and fearsome, that it will likely affect your dreams.  I know it did mine.<br /><br />Also, movies are a powerful medium, but I know of none that can convey the random death, extreme violence, comprehensive exhaustion, stench, and feculence as vividly as this book.  Blackburn allows us to understand the exhaustion of moving tons of earth, rock, and mud to create the pits for the guns, moving more tons of ammunition getting it into pits, the duty of firing the guns around the clock, and then finding your own slit trench (foxhole) to keep yourself alive during those brief moments of rest all the while hoping one of the incoming shells isn't headed for you.<br />When the high speed shells from the Nazi 88s bang into camp and lives are spared because of Czech's built duds to hurt the Nazi effort, we feel the strange exhilaration at being so randomly intact, and yet there is constant fear that the next round coming in might be live and make you dead.  The randomness of trying to take shelter and having fragments destroy something right next to you and yet you are spared is constantly disorienting, yet you stay on your tasks.  Blackburn describes how once he found one tiny fragment of shrapnel in his backpack when he went for a pair of his socks and found only cut up ball of thread, such was the spin velocity and razor edge of the fragment.<br /><br />Then there is the demoralization of moving into an area where you have to dig pits for the guns and yourselves and find chalk just below the surface.  Hours of work with a pickaxe remove only a foot of rock.  Yet the need to protect the guns, the ammo, and yourselves keeps everyone hacking down into chalk.  There were also the two bombings behind the front by Allied Forces costing hundreds of lives and much needed equipment.  First it was the US and then, a couple of weeks later, the RAF.  It was a combination of errors in navigation and, in the second case, a misunderstanding of the signal to use to mark the front of the line.<br /><br />Yet, there is tremendous comradeship.  Blackburn describes how it works more effectively than I have ever heard.  Because of all the casualties, there is a constant stream of replacement soldiers and officers.  Yet, men will risk their lives to care for men they do not know.  They will huddle ever more closely in an impossibly crowded trench to give a new guy at the entrance a few more inches to get him out of the rain and a bit more shelter from enemy fire.<br /><br />The events covered in this book are the few weeks between July 1 and September 5, 1944.  This is a short time in civilian life, but through this book you will experience events that make this seem like an eternity.  The horror of all the rotting flesh, human and farm animals, the dysentery, the artillery that is fired so frequently it glows red in the night, and the inhuman noise will almost wear you out as your read the book.<br /><br />Mr. Blackburn recounts not only his own experiences (in the second person), but provides other stories and background through interviews with other people and official documents and reliable histories.  It is a terrific book because it provides us insight into a part of the Second World War our shorthand way of remembering past events does not provide.  For Americans, it is also wonderful to read about the sacrifices our neighbors to the North made to help our forces break out towards Berlin.  And I found the efforts of the artillerymen, supposedly back of the fighting, positively heroic.  Do yourself a favor and experience this book.  You will feel gratitude towards a generation that is leaving us all too rapidly and understand more what our armed forces are today providing for us all over the world.bes how once he found one tiny fragment of shrapnel in his backpack when he went for a pair of his socks and found only cut up ball of thread, such was the spin velocity and razor edge of the fragment.

As such, I knew most of the personalities in this book. Mr. Stevenson's presentation is accurate and correct, as to the best of my recollection. It is a great read, and truly astounding that such an important and expensive program was mananaged with such incompetance and blatant disrespect for the law.  If you're not outraged at the Pentagon's procurement apparatus at the end of this book, check your pulse.<br /><br />What I did feel was missing, was a telling of general euphoria, arrogance, and excitement that defined the Pentagon during the Regan adminstrations.  Money flowed like water and every service -- not just the Navy or the Air Force -- rushed to the trough.  Black programs, especially stealth, proliferated wildely, and all this was just considered \\"normal\\".  Of course there were billions of dollars being wasted on programs such as the A-12, but then everybody was doing it! I wish a bit more of the popular attitudes of the times had been addressed to provide context.	2005-10-10

It was a wonderful day, filled with great music.  As Faron Young's biographer, I made many contacts who were later helpful to me.  Franks wrote an important story, and I enjoyed reading about all the familiar names.  What detracted from the book was its lack of editing--numerous typos and other errors.  Still, it contains much valuable information about people like Jerry Kennedy, Glenn Sutton, David Houston, Johnny Horton, Claude King, and many others.	2005-10-10

This will be the fourth or Fifth book involving Harry, and provides the usual masterful mix of Magic, Supernatural Terror, Sex and Ultra  Violence.  Unusually this  paperbook  edition has come out first in the US, and I wonder if it has been published elsewhere first? Anyways, I look forward to the  HardBack  publication so I can  have a long  lasting edition of this  superb frightfest.  It is very clear that the already superb narrative  skills of Masterton have been honed through years of  writing, and the payoff is a good hero being presented in an even better manner. Luckily for any horror  fans not familiar with the Divine  Erskine, the backstory bits  relevant to this narrative are given, and hopefully  you will enjoy this  work, and go back to read MANITOU, the  REVENGE OF THE MANITOU, DJINN, BURIAL, and all after reading this master-work.    I am very happy to write that as at October 2005, Masterton has a vast number of works out, and all after a period of almost nothing being available in print. Hopefully the success of these new books will resonate, and such classics as PARIAH will also be re-printed; the Inside cover mentions such other  Masterton gems as TENGU,CHARNEL HOUSE, and THE CHOSEN CHILD, all of which will repay readings, and re-readings. Masterton's  first person narrative creates such vivid worlds that in my opinion, they should ALL  be made into films, and the world of Horror films would be so much the richer.  As usual MANITOU BLOOD  contains a lush collection of well researched  material that will please the supernatural  horror fiend.    ENJOY... I recommend  my favorite Horror  author  with great gusto... you will not be disappointed as he scares, tantalises, titillates, and scares the wits out of you.	2005-10-10

And the history written in 2005 of the world, will be different from the history written fifty years before.<br /><br />Today in 2005 in a year of so many natural disasters Human control over nature does not seem so awesome. And in a time when there is an international war against Terror, it seems we are living more in a Lewis- Huntington Clash of Civilizations Time than a time of growing unity.<br /><br />So too the vast amounts of new knowledge in almost all fields of human and scientific study have altered perceptions as to what is most historically important and relevant.<br /><br />Roberts does a credible job for the time and world in which he writes.<br /><br />Perhaps that is the most that can be asked.	2005-10-10

Unlike the more recent book, however, Winchester ties the different strings together much more successfully and convincingly, and brings off the kind of complex fugal narrative effects he intends through the interweaving of these storylines. Although sometimes he makes claims for which he offers little support (such as his claims as to why the aftermath of Krakatoa led to the spread of fundamentalist islam in Indonesia, for which he offers all kinds of interesting speculations but very little convincing proof), the book is still edifying and intriguing, and shows off Winchester's unique polymathy at its very best.	2005-10-10

The authors are not only judgmental, they are hateful, and to top it off the book is full of inaccuracies. For one: Vivien Leigh's eyes were BLUE, not green. If they'd ever watched Gone With the Wind they would know that. True, in the BOOK Scarlett O'Hara's eyes were green, but that doesn't make Ms. Leigh's eyes change colors to suit. There are also numerous grammatical and spelling errors, as well as confusing errors in pronouns.<br /><br />The authors announce that female actors should get Norplant and males should get vasectomies as soon as they get their Screen Actor Guild cards, as they have no right to have children (they also shouldn't adopt - and they shouldn't have abortions either!). They mention FOUR deaths by overdose or suicides of the children of Hollywood stars/producers, then ask the reader \\"Do YOU know of any suicides or death by overdoses?\\" Well, yeah, I do. Hollywood parents don't have a monopoly on bad parenting, as they seem happy to pronounce over and over here. Where have these guys been?<br /><br />They claim that stars have C-sections in order to avoid stretch marks. Excuse me, I think a woman's body is about as stretched as it's gonna get at that point. And that Steven Bing did NOT want to have a child with Liz Hurley (why'd he have sex with her then - and not get a vasectomy?) And since Bing knows Bill Clinton, he should call Hurley a slut. Huh? But the authors make sure to mention that Bing \\"offered\\" child support to Hurley. They fail to print that Hurley turned it down.<br /><br />A whole chapter is devoted to how terrible Courtney Love is - I think we get the point. They call her daughter Frances Bean a \\"heroin baby\\". Tatum O'Neal's children are referred to as \\"spawn\\". Every time Tom Cruise's name is mentioned it has \\"the heterosexual\\" in front of it - about forty times. This is not cute or clever, this is childish. There's also something about an aluminum pan scam (the people selling it say it's not aluminum, but it is), and some girl who worked for AOL who communicated by email with not-to-be named stars. The authors make sure we know that they despise Hollywood's Liberal, Democratic politics.<br /><br />If you have ever read People magazine or watched Entertainment tonight, you know everything in this book already.

It is packed with photographs from Heidi's long career. The layout is done in short segments so that it seems like a magazine filled with stories.

Men will like the book for the many photographs, many of them semi-nude. It includes a bit of a biography telling how Klum got into modeling and information about her family. However, like a magazine, this book is nothing outstanding. The information is grazed over and the many how-to articles do not really add much.

I had been searching for answers and had my child diagnosed with inappropriate diagnosis so I was glad to have an answer.  My son is just a couple months shy of 10 years old and it (SIPD) had really done a lot of harm to him (he is out-of-sync) as the title describes and now I can help him.   <br />  The book is easy to understand but it is a lot to absorb when you realize how all the different senses can be affected.  I would recommend that schools, counselors, etc. get to know more about it.  I'm sure that my child isn't the only one out there who has suffered unnecessarily and been considered the behavior problem in class.  I was so glad to be able to call the superintendent of the public school system to speak to him about my findings and to let him know that the school needs to be up-to-date on these types of things.

It was about teenage girl named Lucy who believs that since she has diabetes she was the undead (vampire). So, she surrounds herself with vampires. Then, she meets the new guy at school, Dylan. While his blue eyes enchant her he says he can introduce her to a real vampire. She takes him up on his offer adn plunges into a world of late night partying and ultimatly loosing herself.     I liked this book beacuse it wasn't anywhere near normal. It wasn't one of those books where the plot is the same as a million others. It was unique. Plus the message is what mostly everyone needs to learn: Follow your heart adn be true to yourself. Don't change for anyone else.	2005-10-10

It also has very little to do with Ransom, the main character of the first two books.  <br />The plot centers around a young couple named Mark and Jane Studdock. Mark finds himself working for NICE, the sinister organization that gets its work done by not telling anybody (including most employees) what's really going on. Jane, meanwhile, ends up with the good guys thanks to a newfound ability of hers.  <br />For the most part, the book is very well-written (as one would expect from Lewis) and enjoyable. Most of the characters are complex and interesting, especially the Studdocks.  <br />The story's main problem is the ending. The bad guys are all finished off within the space of a few pages, and without anything resembling a struggle. After so much buildup, it leaves one feeling a little cheated. Also, the concluding chapter is strange and seems very out of place. <br />All of the mythology can get tiresome at times, especially when the planetary eldils (the 'gods') are involved. It slows the book down considerably. An exception to this is Merlin himself, who is a very interesting character. Sadly, he doesn't show up until the end, and leaves right after he's done him job. <br />The book also very strongly supports a \\"traditional\\" role for women in marriage, even going so far as having the good guys tell Jane that she shouldn't join them without Mark's permission. This idea is said to be the will of God himself, not just someone's opinion. This was offensive at times, but did not contribute to the four-star rating, since it's so subjective. A person who agrees with Lewis will probably find that it enhances the book. <br />With these minor reservations, I recommend That Hideous Strength to anyone who likes fantasy, especially C.S. Lewis fans.	2005-10-10

He has a good point.  <br /> <br />Opinionated people of all political and social types will tell you that Ayn Rand must be loved or hated, believed or disbelieved, revered or loathed. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Ayn Rand is very much an extremist, with a talent for (purposefully or not) persuading others to agree with her. In fact, such persuasion goes against some of her own principles: that the human being must depend upon HIS OWN reason to exist. Read the book with this in mind, and you will get far--agree or disagree, but do so based on your own logic and experience, not on some misguided belief that the author must be taken \\"all or nothing\\". <br /> <br />Since this is the type of book that infuriates people, it should be read. This is my opinion. It is important to know the beliefs of the loudest extremists in order to be well-informed and so accurately find your own position somewhere in the middle. Ayn Rand and Noam Chomsky and Marx and Voltaire cannot, any of them, be taken indiscriminately. That would be a plagiarism of opinion, which I think is a basic sin. But all of these authors should be read. If one is going to aspire to the title of intellectual, or even if he simply wants to think about issues, he must be exposed to all ends of the spectrum.  <br /> <br />Remember (this seems to get lost in all the debate)--Atlas Shrugged is a NOVEL, not a work of nonfiction. Ideas completely aside, this is an amazing book and a milestone in modern  American literature. The writing is superb; the characters well-thought-out and INTERESTING (though I am inclined to think people like these cannot exist; Rand actually counters this, somewhat unconvincingly, in the Forward); the dialogue, description, plot and language are very powerful. Maturing writers could do worse than read Ayn Rand simply for her writing. (This is particularly impressive since English is Rand's second language.) The quality of the writing makes reading the (lengthy) book a worthwhile use of time whether or not the reader agrees with the ideas presented in it. Just don't let Rand's agreeable fluency alone sway you to her way of thinking. <br /> <br />Read this book. It is fascinating and well worth your time, and as I have mentioned the writing is fantastic. Go into it with an open mind. But be a filter, not a sponge.  <br />	2005-10-10

Every aspect of a long distance relationship was discussed in realistic terms, often utilizing a real relationship to help explain different situations.  He did not gloss over the difficulties of an LDR, but rather delved into them and exposed them.  His tone was often optimistic, but I appreciated this pragmatism, as I went to his book for advice rather than motivation.

George Saunders is the modern master of black humor; he demonstrates this in his first 2 story collections.  This novel is a departure from the dark episodes characterizing his first 2 efforts.  Here we have an imaginary world where a malavolent dictator usurps power by mearly clothing himself as president.  The media is a sounding board for the administration by shouting meaningless slogans supporting the powers that be.  The Short Term Residency Zone is turned into a \\"threat\\" as its residents are turned into enemies.  The construction of the duality through the media and artifice of threat informs the coming attempt at genocide. Saunders is playing with the friendly face of totalatarianism of Hitler/Stalin and lesser dictators like G Dubya.	2005-10-10

It's written in present tense but Chris Grabenstein makes it easy to read. It's as if we're sliding into a booth at The Pancake House and he's saying, \\"You won't believe what happened to me.\\"<br /><br />While Grabenstein lulls me into thinking that TILT A WHIRL is just a funny book, there's some nasty business going on in Sea Haven, New Jersey, a small barrier island favored by tourists. The Playland amusement park makes an ideal setting for a maze of distortions, deceptions and lies.<br /><br />TILT A WHIRL'S narrator is Danny Boyle, an unarmed summer cop who acts as chauffeur for regular cop John Ceepak, an ex-Military Police who lives by The Code and has Iraq flashbacks.<br /><br />On a sunny Saturday morning Ceepak is about to roust a boy for stealing tip quarters at The Pancake House when a girl covered with blood comes screaming down the street. Her name is Ashley. Her father, Sea Haven's richest developer and slumlord, has been shot while sitting with her in the Tilt A Whirl.<br /><br />The murder scene appears to be a homeless hangout. Ceepak and Danny find castoff syringes and a shallow tunnel under the park fence. They also get a whiff of seductive perfume. Before the investigation can get underway, Ashley disappears. Word is out that she's sole heir to her father's fortune. Can a ransom note be far behind?<br /><br />There's funny/ha-ha and funny/witty. This book is both. There's a hilarious scene where a possible witness tries to escape through an automated car wash. The author has referred frequently to Bruce Springsteen's lyrics. I'm thinking that Jim Croce's \\"Workin' At The Car Wash Blues\\" would fit nicely here.<br /><br />Grabenstein has worked in New York's improvisational comedy troupes. If you want to know what TILT A WHIRL is really like, see the author's photo on the back flap. His grin says it all.	2005-10-10

The Abbey Theatre commissioned Heaney to do yet another for its centenary. In an afterword to this volume he explains the genesis of his version -- why he decided to do it and how. He explained his poetic tactics, as it were, and justified a \\"middle style\\" by referring to Yeats, who wrote of a \\"common\\" style he and others used -- many years earlier, of course -- in plays for the Abbey. <br /> <br />Hmm. There is no question that the language Heaney uses here is plain. It is possible to see his three-beat lines and his five-beat pentameter and his Beowulf-style 4-beat alliterative lines in the reading. What I don't see is poetry -- I don't actually even see much verse. The language seems neutral rather than charged. Poetry can use common words, but needs to cause shivers -- not in every line, but often enough that the reader keeps alert for more electricity. The various verse lines he uses are rather weakly distinctive: the forms hover around their ideals without touching them enough to keep a listener on track. <br /> <br />I saw the play performed by the Chicago Shakespeare Theater company on September 18, 2005. It played somewhat better than it read (e.g. the initial byplay between Antigone and Ismene, and that between Creon and Haemon). Still, though, having read it, I was listening carefully (hopefully?) for the beat of the verse -- or at least the feel of the verse. In fact, though the actors did a good job and did, as I think, justice to the text, it seemed rather flat. <br /> <br />Perhaps I disagree with the \\"plain\\" style. I think Sophocles was a powerful poet whose language rang with hard beauty and allusive power. He must have been. Perhaps, though, all this happened in the songs that the chorus, and sometimes the principals, sang. For another quarrel I have with this version is that it does not give any indications of choral parts -- strophe and antistrophe -- so even in principle it is not singable. What is more, this is a rather loose rendering of Sophocles play (a \\"version\\"), which does not really depart from the drama, but makes it more spare of expression. This comes at the expense of some of the specifically Greek elements, such as constant specific references to Zeus. Yet it is still a classical Greek play, just less of one. Moreover, there were no notes on the text, while there were at least a few puzzling parts that should have been noted, as well as the choral parts. But who knows -- maybe the Abbey Theatre made more of it than I can!	2005-10-10

Like most Original Thinkers, Dr Emoto stirs the Passions of detractors and Students alike; it's hard to be in the middle-of-the-road on this subject!

I seriously doubt any Human alive can say that they have not been influenced by the Energies of another Human.  Be it Positive or Negative.  Those energetic patterns influenced them to such a degree as to change their Emotional State in that moment.

When TJ's prized horse becomes ill, a local veterinarian is called to treat the animal.  The vet, Dr. Mare Gillespie, has lived in Meridianville for the past ten years and has seen the poverty caused by Thomas Meridian's withdrawal from the area.  Like most of the native residents, she harbors a great dislike for the family, yet she and TJ are each intrigued by the other woman and a relationship develops.  Together they discover love and friendship that endures through personal misunderstandings, a night attack on the ranch, and an ecological disaster that could destroy the town and surrounding lands.

This book is a tribute to the late Senator Paul Wellstone (D MN) and his wife Shelia, who died in a plane accident. Before his untimely demise, Wellstone was one of the most dynamic examples that liberalism was not dead in the Democratic Party and was not dead in America either.<br /><br />I loved his floor speeches and sponsored legislation because they intentionally sought an America where people truly were united. He believed in and genuinely loved the American people.<br /><br />This book, influenced by the workshop series Mark and David Wellstone started to honor their parents, explains how everybody and anybody can become a more effective progressive activist. The best cause in the world looses visibility when organizers cannot get their message out to the public or even figure out how to field organize.<br /><br />Since even experienced activists can become overwhelmed with all of the tasks we need to do in tight races, having the basic steps laid out was also helpful for us.  Another major strength of the book is that it is for novice politicos and veteran organizers alike. The more, the merrier!<br /><br />Most of all, this book stresses the Wellstone way was and is connecting with people.

Like this book, and most everything else that has come out since Richard's death, it's not worth the time spent to even pick it up and read the back.<br /><br />\\"The Travelling Vampire Show\\" and \\"Body Rides\\" were good though. Almost all of his other books are the same slasher stories simply set in different locations and are all very, VERY predicatable.	2005-10-10

Say what you will about Stephen King, you must admit he is a master at his craft.  That being said, when I finished this book and read his afterward (always a highlight of his books, in my opinion), he said that most people would either love this book or hate this book, with virtually no one taking the middle ground.<br /><br />I'm one of those middle grounders.<br /><br />This book was written for the Hard Case Crime imprint, a publisher dedicated to writing little paperback mystery/crime books that hearken back to the old days.  There was a crime, yes; there were a great many clues to the crime, yes.  However, this book focused more on three characters who happen to be interested in the crime than in the actual crime itself.<br /><br />Now, ordinarily, this wouldn't bother me in a King book at all.  After all, King is a genius when it comes to characterization.  I will always maintain that his Roland of Gilead is one of the most interesting characters created . . . ever.  But, for an imprint called Hard<br />Case Crime, I was expecting more noir and less conversation about the crime.  And those characters he spotlights, while very charismatic, still seemed to be missing something to make them completely dynamic.  The dialogue felt a bit too easy, and the characters a bit too obvious.  I still loved them, nonetheless, but not as much as other King characters.<br /><br />As always, his setting is expertly rendered, giving you just enough to see the water, smell the air, feel the chilly breeze, taste the fish and chips, and hear the voices.  Less is more, and King has a firm grasp of this notion.<br /><br />All in all, this was an entertaining read.  Most of you folks could probably finish it in a day or two, and you'll keep turning page after page.  But, I think King is right, by the end of the book, you will either love it or hate it.  Unless you're like me, and see little things you both love and hate, appreciating the good and the bad.  After all, few of us could ever entertain the notion of doing better than Stephen King at writing.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:0595360823 Souls Triumphant]]and hate, appreciating the good and the bad.

Behind what appears to be caricatures, are people with some subtle nuances---the hero has some tragic flaws, the loyal sidekick is far from being a sycophant, and the saloon sweetheart certainly has no heart of gold.

In 2004, Richardson, a highly regarded specialist in royal and peerage genealogy with numerous published articles to his credit, brought out the first volume in a planned series -- _Plantagenet Ancestry,_ which tracked the descents of some 190 immigrants to the North American colonies from the Plantagenet monarchs of England, and which weighed in at 945 pages. This second installment is 150 pages thicker, and there are at least two more volumes in development, on descents from early feudal barons, and from the Emperor Charlemagne.<br /><br />Any high school graduate knows the term \\"Magna Carta\\" (the \\"Great Charter\\") but most have probably only a hazy understanding of its key role as the foundation of the English legislative system (and therefore of our own), and that it established the principle that even the king, the highest authority in the land, was subject to the law. The baronial party that forced King John to sign the document in 1215 didn't trust him to live up to the limitations and conditions it laid down, and so they elected from among their own number twenty-five barons to monitor and enforce compliance. Of these twenty-five Sureties, seventeen had descendants past four generations; of those, there were two father-son pairs (Richard and Gilbert de Clare, earls of Hertford, and Roger and Hugh Bigod, earls of Norfolk), leaving fifteen distinct families that were ancestral to 238 17th century North American colonists. As with the first volume, the author's careful organization of a large mass of complex data makes this a comparatively easy book to use, either for ready-reference or for extended reading. All descendant families are organized alphabetically, numbered generationally from the Magna Carta Surety, with emphasis on patrilineal descents. This is not a listing of all descendants in each generation; grandchildren without descendants themselves, for instance, are excluded. Citation of sources -- mostly the original sources -- is very extensive and the bibliography runs to nearly 100 large-size pages.<br /><br />With such a wide-ranging project, with so many sources being perused, one might hope for new discoveries, and there are many included in the book. Some, of course are minor corrections, but at least a dozen are noteworthy, especially as they affect the Bohun, de Verdun, Grey, Hastings, Pole, FitzMaurice, and Mowbray families.<br /><br />As with _Plantagenet Ancestry,_ after borrowing it for review, I bought a copy of this one for myself and I shall be waiting eagerly for subsequent volumes in the series.bibliography runs to nearly 100 large-size pages.<br /><br />With such a wide-ranging project, with so many sources being perused, one might hope for new discoveries, and there are many included in the book.

I knew something was wrong and at first I couldn't put my finger on it, which is normal in the infancy stages of blackmail.  As time passed, it all came into focus and I realized that this woman's personality was not going to change and that I could not fix her so I saved what self-esteem and dignity I had left and left the relationship.  The author does a great job explaining how a person's behavior can change, but their personality usually does not.  That is unless however you can get the blackmailer and/or narcissist into therapy.  Even then you still face dismal odds of that person changing.  While the basis of this book was to deal with the blackmailer currently in your life, I used it as a reference to further reinforce why my decision to leave my relationship was the right move; and it did just that. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Pinsky jumps right into the discussion of culture and the so called \\"culture wars,\\" and shows us all the many ways in which our poetry is a public expression of deep knowing and the inner voice. His takeoff point is Alexis de Tocqueville's description of American life as lacking in poetic quality in Democracy in America.  Americans, Tocqueville maintains, will focus not on the heroic actions of aristocratic poetry, but on the natural features of the landscape and the interior feelings, emotions and makeup of the individual person. Pinsky sees this observation as prescient of what our poetry eventually has turned out to be. He sees America's poetry as a poetry of shared memory--shared and socialized through the human voice.  <br /> <br />The human voice of the poem as read aloud is the actual instrument, for Pinsky, of culture--making men and women social beings.  This, of course, is the genius of Pinsky's Favorite Poem Project, which has generated two anthologies to date and a video archive of the social moments of America's poetic voices as brought to life by ordinary Americans. <br /> <br />He provides special insights into the \\"skewed quatrains and secular hymns\\" of Emily Dickinson (one of my favorite poets)and  Walt Whitman's project (partly a failure and partly a success) to fashion himself into the persona of a great national bard.    <br /> <br />This is one of the best descriptions of poetic \\"voice\\" that you will ever find. Pinsky himself has the credentials for it, given his own remarkable body of poems, his translations of Dante's Inferno and now his new book on David--perhaps one of the greatest models for all poetry.   <br /> <br />If you write or read poetry, this is a book you will resonate with.	2005-10-10

As I read the book,  I was mesmerized by the words of Ashley Smith and Stacy Mattingly (her co-author).  When the story first broke last March, I told my local book store owner that the book would be appearing and when it did to let me know. She did ; I bought it and read it in one evening. I was so inspired by Ashley's  story. Much of the writing, I am sure was done by Stacy Mattingly, who has assisted others in Christian writing...but the thoughts and feeling are those of Ashley Smith. Because of Ashley Smith, I have gone back to read and re-read  The Purpose-Driven Life by Rick Warren. Two people gave The Purpose-Driven Life to me when it first came out...i guess they saw in me a need for Rick Warren's message...they were correct.  I have had a problem strewn life..all kinds of problems since early childhood...I think I understand Ashlely. Her life is similar to many of the students with whom I work every day...coming from a \\"good home\\" means nothing...nor does coming from a \\"bad home\\" either..not in and of itself...it is all about the inside of you and what is in your heart. Ashley still has demons to deal with..so do all of us.  I probably will never write my book..mainly because I do not have the courage to tell my story for all the world to see.  It does take much courage to put yourself out there. Thank God she did survive to tell her story...I, for one, am richer in my spirit because of Ashely and her book.	2005-10-10

I hear Jeremy Brett in every word of Holmes dialogue in these novels.<br /><br />As the fans of a television show will detail events going on offstage during an episode, Douglas shows us details of Holmes' investigations that would not have seemed pertinent to Conan Doyle as he wrote -- but he might well have been thinking of them. She twangs every Holmsian heartstring with her deft expansion of the Doyle tales.<br /><br />There is one difference though.  Douglas shows us a 21st Century woman in Irene Adler, a woman truly with A Soul of Steel (as this novel will be retitled in its December 2005 release,) a woman Doyle could never have written.  Adler's biography makes her attitude plausible, and we can easily believe she bested Sherlock Holmes more than once.<br /><br />Even if you've never read any Sherlock Holmes -- read these books.	2005-10-10

I completely disagree with the reviewers who say you must be a scholar to use this tool.  I don't even have a masters degree.<br /><br />In Gordon Fee's excellent NT Exegesis book he recommends consulting this book as part of the normal exegesis process for sermon or paper development.  When attempting to translate the text, one needs to ascertain the text.  If you've ever had the experience I have had of looking at the critical apparatus in the GNT and wondering how to decipher it, then this book will help you.  It gives some background on each decision for the options.<br /><br />For example, a verse may have variations in the manuscripts.  The committee who determined which manuscripts to follow made their decisions on the basis of some general rules for Textual Criticism.  The actual basis for each decision in general is explained...usually in a sentence or two...for every single decision that appears in the apparatus for the GNT.  So if you want to know the gist of what's going on with the ratings for each rating in the apparatus, you need this book. From that perspective it is a veritable gold mine.  If you take time to verify the text before doing exegesis for either a sermon or a paper, then you cannot afford to ignore this volume.	2005-10-10

The book turned out to be a 12 month guide to learn poses and history about yoga - very useful information, but not exactly what I was looking for.  The description of how to get into the poses was very detailed, but as someone who already knows how to do the poses, I found some of the pictures confusing or just incorrect.  I would recommend this book for a beginner who wants to slowly immerse themselves in the history of yoga and gradually learn new poses.  However, if you are looking for a book that really relates each pose to the corresponding season and gives the benefits of doing certain poses during certain times of the year (as I was) then this book is not for you.	2005-10-10

Here are three:        1. TMIS - Too Much Information Syndrome.      2. Hard-to-follow Organization, from cover to cover.      3. Evidence doesn't support main arguments.    ****************************************  1. TMIS - Too Much Information Syndrome.    ****************************************  One hugely ironic example: When the author tried to demonstrate that when doctors at Cook County Hospital Emergency Department treat chest-pain patients, many seemingly important medical details (e.g. drinking habits) can be ignored (for more accurate diagnosis! yes, no kidding!) and therefore help more patients, he writes:         \\"[The department head] was raised in New York City, the product of a classical Jesuit      education: Regis for High School, where he had four years      of Latin and Greek, and Fordham University for college,       where he read everything from the ancients to Wittgenstein       and Heidegger and thought about an academic career in       philosophy...\\"     How are these details related to the main message?  And they are not even remotely important at all.    *******************************************************  Second, Hard-to-follow organization, from cover to cover.  *******************************************************  Just two examples among many:     The introduction chapter tells the reader about the three tasks of the book.  That's nice, but if you want to find them, good luck.  They are buried in the middle of 2nd section:\\"The Internal Computer\\" (and first two tasks are in the middle of paragraphs).      The closing chapter tells us the two lessons of Blink (sort of).    The first lesson (\\"We are often careless about our snap judgement\\") isn't obvious until the reader encounters the mentioning of the second lesson and it is at the third sentence of second paragraph of page 252:     The second lesson, which begins as a second sentence in last paragraph on page 252, is about we can make our snap judgement better.     *******************************************************  Third, Evidence doesn't directly support main arguments.  *******************************************************  A pair of contrasting examples of this flaw are in Chapter 4: Creating Structure for Spontaneity.  From the title I'd assume the author will show us creating a structure can spawn (good) spontaneity (and maybe how to create a structure, etc.)    The author presents two long, long cases.    First case is about a Pantagon war game in 2002.  This includes an inspiring account of the more \\"spontaneous\\" team won the war game.  But not much is said about how structure was built or how structure helped or what the structure was.      Second case is about Emergency Department of the Chicago Cook County Hospital.  This example has a stunning tale of how doctors used a structured approach to improve their treatment of patients.  But nothing is said about \\"spontaneity\\".     ******************    5 stars for nuggets of fascinating information in this book.  2 stars for many flaws for it.  Round up to 4 -:)	2005-10-10

For that reason I would be expected to read his book on this most important subject. I am gratified to be able to say this short book is one of the most cogent and well-reasoned I have ever read on the subject of gays and lesbians and the place they should have in the Church. Some might assume that since Bishop Alexander voted to confirm Bishop Gene Robinson of New Hampshire that he must be a \\"liberal\\" and that's that. As This Far By Grace indicates, his current position that gay people and their relationships can indeed be channels of grace is one he came to gradually and over time. He relates his own personal journey and looks critically at those scriptural passages that have been used to attack homosexuality. He does not merely engage in a battle of \\"proof texts\\" by quoting one passage to refute another; he examines the context of each and concludes that none of these Bible passages contemplates anything like a committed or monogamous relationship. For Episcopalians who have an open mind on this issue but may not fully understand it, this book treats their possible reservations with respect; it is not a polemic. It could be read by itself, or in combination with \\"To Set Our Hope On Christ,\\" the US Episcopal Church's theological justification for ordination of gays to holy orders and for placing positive value on gay relationships. Together they set forth a strong case that justice for gays and lesbians is indeed what the Spirit is now saying to the Church.	2005-10-10

I got it from a friend who didn't finish it, and now I know why.  I read about half, skimmed the rest, stopped and read when I saw somebody was getting peed on, decided I could have lived the rest of my life quite nicely NOT having read that, and then fast forwarded to the end. I'm sure I missed a lot of plot by not reading the last half, but at least my soul didn't suffer.  The writing is slow, plodding, methodical, and doesn't sound or feel like the voice of a troubled adolescent, full of rage, or even ambivalence.  The sex is vulgar and coarse, but when it gets to the actual sexual material, there's no processing of feelings or sensations; perhaps that is the only part that seems like it could come from a teenage boy.  I've read a lot of repulsive or vulgar material that was fascinating, like, \\"Ecstasy\\" and \\"Fox Girl.\\"  This book simply didn't interest me on any level.	2005-10-10

Too many of these books lose their credibility due to bad writing, unrealistic situations, and a tell-all attitude which cheapens the information presented. This book is not like that. It is classily put together like an old movie that never showed sex but smartly implied it. Hale does not blatantly throw her longtime love affair with Chaplin in the reader's face; she forces one to read between the lines and to still realize that there were barriers like marriage that she did not cross.<br /><br />Along with stories about Chaplin, Hale reminisces on her life before and during stardom. She tells of winning a beauty contest that took her to Hollywood and meeting Chaplin on the street one day. She tells about filming The Gold Rush and her passionate love for Chaplin ever after.<br /><br />More than anything else, though, this book gives its reader total insight into Chaplin as a man. He was tempestuously moody and difficult, yet insanely insightful. This all comes from a woman who knew him well for much of his life. So many books dismiss his personality to dissect his genius as a film maker but only glance at his behavior outside of that. This book looks into what Chaplin was like socially by a woman who was not only close to him, but is representative of the many women in the comic's life.<br /><br />Miss Hale comes off as an annoying know-it-all bragging about Chaplin having an attraction to her during The Gold Rush in the Unknown Chaplin series. However, reading this book gives a whole new perspective on her. It helps one to understand that she was not bragging about Chaplin's affections; she was simply reveling in a tiny glimpse of hope that he might feel even a fraction of the love she felt for him. This is an honest, emotional account.	2005-10-10

Some of them are beautiful, but downright bizzare. Others make no effort at all to connect with the folklore and practices that are known from their original context. <br /> <br />Diana's book includes a brief survey for each rune of material from sources that are actually based on scholarly effort and practical use, along with the original folkloric rune poems themselves. This is combined with her extensive personal and community-based experience in scholarly, religious, and magical practice. It's not a thin book, but it is nevertheless a reasonably concise guide for material that would otherwise take a library to collect, if you could even find it all anymore. <br /> <br />I can say from firsthand experience that the rituals she includes are highly effective, and even kind of fun.

It's all well and good to have a property grow up, but this is just sick gritty for the sake of being gritty.  Some of our beloved characters get killed.  Cheetara is raped daily.  Wily Kit, a child, grows up as Mummra's sex slave.  It's just disgusting.  It's like an extremely bad fanfic, written by an overzealous and sexually frustrated teen.  To add to this is how badly the sexual abuse is handled.  Despite being ravaged for years, chained up in a mine, etc, Cheetara is drawn like a Playboy model.  And not only does her body not suffer the torture, but she doesn't seem broken or mentally unstable like true rape victims are.  Obviously, the idea of Cheetara being raped is MEANT to be sensual and to sell the book, otherwise we wouldn't be treated to full page spreads of her looking sexy in chains.  (And people attack \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" for glorifying rape... that was realistic in the horror). <br /> <br />On the same token, Wily Kit, who is obviously at this point the product of child rape and molestation (by a frickin' MUMMY) seems trong willed and again, is drawn in a way that must be to make comic book fanboys go \\"HEHEH!!  Look, sexy!\\" <br /> <br />And to finish it up, later in this series, the Thundercats have to team with the Mutants against the Dogs of War.  And what happens?  Apperantly, the Thundercats forgive all that horror upon them, have a big celebration feast and Lion-o TOASTS Mumm-ra!?  \\"Cheers to Mumm-ra, who killed my people and raped my friends!\\"  I'm surprised they didn't have Cheetara giggle at the mutants sitting at the table and say \\"So... my room later?\\" <br /> <br />All in all, a TERRIBLE, repulsive story and anyone who showers it with praise is obviously degenerate and has no true love for the original. <br />	2005-10-10

I am a mother of a sensory child.  This book changed my life, and it is an essential resource for anyone who wants to learn or help a child with sensory integration.  It is my \\"Bible\\".<br /><br />Unlike most books on sensory integration, it was written by a mother Nancy Peske, and an OT, Lindsey Biel, who understand what it is like to have and raise and treat a sensory child.  It is easy to read and understand and begins by telling a story of Nancy Peske's own personal experiences with her own child to explain what it is like to have a sensory child, and to accept that you have a sensory child and how to help your sensory child.<br /><br />This wonderful book provides practical solutions for everyday living.  This book truly helps you to understand what sensory issues are, and what the technical language means (in easy to understand explanations and examples).<br /><br />This book is the best I have ever read with respect to providing specific techniques you can use to help your sensory child to eat, play, sleep and learn efficiently, to focus, to pay attention, to organize, to self-regulate and so much more.<br /><br />This book also tells you what you can do as a parent to help advocate for your child.  It provides the steps for evaluation, and the types of therapies which are available at home and what to expect when you work with an OT. The book also contains information on how to set up an IEP or a 504 plan for your child and how to get the services you need to help your child.<br /><br />This book is extremely practical and what I like the best about it, is that is written like a handbook, so that if you already are familiar with sensory integration, you can read any chapter without having to read the entire book to find the resources that you need.  The book provides plenty of links to current research and valuable sources of information in books, videos, DVDs and online, which have made such a huge difference in my life and my son's life!<br /><br />I have read all the books and research on the internet out there on sensory integration and this book is definitely the best.  I recommend it to any parent, teacher, caregiver, OT or friend who wants to help understand and/or successfully treat a child with sensory integration.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you also read the Out of Sync Child, and the Out of Sync Child Has Fun, by Carol Stock Kranowitz which are also essential resources on sensory integration.ead all the books and research on the internet out there on sensory integration and this book is definitely the best.

When the attacker dropped a grenade, Dunham placed his own helmet over the explosive to protect his men. His act saved their lives and cost him personal injury, as well as earning him a nomination for the Congressional Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award for military valor. Offering a view of the Iraq war and rebuilding from the people who put their lives on the line daily, The Gift Of Valor does not gloss over or seek to hide the cold brutality of the ongoing battle, but aspires to the hope that something greater can arise from that specific episode of bloodshed and pain.

A strong story line that seems to flash by as the the moment of impact hits you and is gone in a couple of chapters. Hard to read at first until you get to grips with the author's style/method of introducing new characters. A fair bit of the story seems autobiographical and maybe the addition of stronger verbs and adverbs may have added more impact. Vey good for a first effort from the author though.

Marnie has done a fabulous job of raising her orphaned teenaged nephew from the time David was just 4 years old. Suddenly David's father, someone Marnie's sister had a brief summer romance with 16 years earlier, appears on the scene, having recently discovered that he had a son and wanting to be a part of the boy's life. Law is a weathly and famous astronaut who can provide David with the material things Marnie can't. Marnie feels she can't compete with Law, however she's determined to fight him for the love and custody of the boy she's always considered to be her own. She doesn't approve of his bachlor lifestyle and believes he'll be a bad influence on David.  Adding intrigue and depth to the situation is the fact that Marnie had a childhood crush on Law the summer her sister was involved with him, and has never forgotten him. He remained the standard by which she measured new men into her life, and they all fell very short.<br /><br />Although a more dated, less polished Sandra Brown book, Long Time Coming packs a lot of punch as Marnie and Law come together to do what's best for David, merge their differing lifestyles and values, and deal with their feelings towards each other, and demonstrate that both are worthy of David's love and devotion.	2005-10-10

This sourcebook was a big disappointment to me, especially considering the high list price.  If you want to check this out, try one of the many used copies being sold now.  My copy will soon be listed. <br /> <br />At first glance, I was psyched about this book.  It contains nearly 200 creatures and robots of widely varying types, with a generous smattering of templates.  In the end, this book has not been too useful to my campaign, and I have ended up making up a lot of my own monsters. <br /> <br />First, let me tell you what is good in this book. <br /> <br />Machines and Mutants (hereinafter \\"M&M\\") contains a collection of well-conceived critters.  A lot of imagination went into this book.  They had five authors, and it shows.  I actually like many of the robots included.  The robots in M&M can serve many roles in your campaign.  Some are deadly adversaries, other comical nuisances.  Some enhance PC's, or make useful followers.  There are nine robot templates, allowing the GM to easily make up all kinds of crazy contraptions. <br /> <br />Also good are the \\"environmental templates\\" for monsters found in different ecosystems and climates.  These help a GM create a world of genetic chaos by allowing further small variations on stock mutant creatures. <br /> <br />The main problem is that so many of the monsters in this book are *not* useful in a campaign.  The prime example is the full page devoted to poison ivy.  I'm not joking: regular old poison ivy, the nemesis of many a boy scout.  While poison ivy can have a place in a campaign, it scarcely deserves an entire page in a core rulebook.  There are many examples of the same problem: an entire page devoted to dust mites (again, I am not joking); nearly a whole page devoted to a bacterium whose only game-worthy property is providing power to nanobots; a half page devoted to a tree (bastard toadfax) whose only property is its spooky appearance; a whole page to a weed that is useful only for damaging crops; a wholepage devoted to that fact that wasps like to live in fig trees; an insectivorous plant that is only useful for controlling insects; one and a half pages to flesh-eating bacteria; one half page devoted to a tree that produces superior wood; three-quarters of a page devoted to qat, the narcotic leaf from the real world; and many more.  Quite a few creatures are exhaustively described whose only role in the game is to be eaten.  There are some puzzling entries, such as the six-legged racoon that is for all intents and purposes exactly the same as a four-legged racoon. <br /> <br />Many of the monsters from the old TSR version of Gamma World are converted to d20 format, so that may be useful in many nostalgic campaigns (although this version of Gamma World is quite different in spirit from the old... if you liked the old Gamma World, you should be playing Omega World instead). <br /> <br />This book is not so much a good source of monsters as it is a good source of background.  Many irrelevent creatures are described in depth.  As a result, you pay a lot for a big book with little substance.	2005-10-10
US	53060790	R1J0TOBOCT4H3B	030733855X	164671132	John	Books	5	149	156	N	N	John Lennon history continued	As anniversaries are celebrated and observed, more information referencing the Beatles are released.  However, works by immediate family members or those closest to individual band members may become less.  The release is quite fitting in that it coincides with what would have been John's 65th birthday and 25 years since his death.  As with any event in history, having the opportunity to read accounts from those who witnessed the events bring us much closer to understanding who the individual was and debunking any myths or rumors that have existed through out the years and laying them to rest.  In this case, Cynthia Lennon attempts to show the truth about John Lennon.  What makes her biography or memoir so unique is that she examines her relationship with John Lennon from his pre-Beatle days as a college art student in the late 1950s up to her bitter divorce in 1969 as well as the John's post-Beatle years.  Her story shows the change and transformation of John Lennon to readers, and the emotions and guilt that she experienced as she went through the process -- the coming to terms with her loss and being at peace with what happened.<br /><br />JOHN is not a book about the Beatles or their music.  Cynthia guides the reader through a chronology of her life with stories about how she met John Lennon and relating events that pertained to her own personal life, her long-time friendship with her girlfriend, Phyllis McKenzie, and her mother, who were always there to support her through trying times.  The most interesting aspect of the book is the love-hate relationship between Cynthia and John's Aunt Mimi, and more in-depth information about John's sisters, Julia and Jacqui.  In addition, the most heart wrenching part of the book is the one between father and son, which covers Julian's birth up to John's death.  Cynthia's correlation with what song or record John was working on or singing about was effective in telling the story as it related to Julian and Cynthia's reality.  Cynthia ties loose ends of the John Lennon story, and suggests that drugs and John's longing for a \\"mother-like\\" figure may have caused him to forge a life with Yoko Ono.<br /><br />Overall, JOHN is a compelling and inviting book.  The photographs that accompany Cynthia's narrative are enthralling as well.  Some have never been published and come directly from Cynthia Lennon's own personal collection, while others may be all too familiar to John Lennon and Beatle fans.  JOHN offers readers another perspective of the man who became an iconoclastic figure after his passing, but was merely as human as his fans.ia ties loose ends of the John Lennon story, and suggests that drugs and John's longing for a \\"mother-like\\" figure may have caused him to forge a life with Yoko Ono.

Jerry looks forward to bonding with his younger brother Peter, a first-time camper, while introducing him to the pleasures of the Pennsylvania forest and to the American Indian rituals that have traditionally been the core of the camp program. Instead he finds himself engulfed in a series of increasingly terrifying adventures set in that forest and orchestrated by Buck Silverstone, the camp's enigmatic, charismatic teacher of Native American lore. <br /> <br />The Mad Cook is at once a poignant coming-of-age novel, a compelling who-dunnit, and a thoughtful meditation on the darkness and violence that lie just beneath the surface of everyday life.

This is really what the Boost community ([...]) needs to increase the awareness of its excellent libraries! Not to mention how much I needed it to improve my programming!<br /><br />As a programmer, you have so many task specific features to implement, that you really don't have the time (or even interest) to implement the fundamentals. Yes, you have the C++ standard library to assist you, but the Boost libraries take you to an entirely new level. And the Boost libraries have the absolute top quality, which most of us just can not achieve even if we had all the time in the world. Yet, the libraries *are* fundamental in the sense that they solve common programming issues (and also in many cases show the path to upcoming C++ standards). It is hard to imagine an application making use of *all* the Boost libraries, but I'd say that it is equally hard to imagine one which would not benefit from any Boost library.<br /><br />[Did you get this far without ever having visited [...] Then now is the time to do that...<br /><br />Done? Ok, let's continue with the book.]<br /><br />Without any statistics to support me, I am pretty convinced that the average Boost user is far more experienced in C++ than most of us who make a living out of C++ programming (let alone those who don't). This book will help to flatten out this bias, by making Boost easy to understand and immediately useful for those who read it. It is clearly written - technically correct while never being boring, even if you read from first to last page. It includes many code examples, which repeatedly made me associate to uses in my programming. I would have liked the examples and the Boost libraries on an accompanying CD, but this is no major concern - it's better to get the freshest release from boost.org anyway. I read the book basically from start to end, skimming a couple of libraries that I found no immediate use for. The book covers 12 libraries out of 58 which makes me looking forward to a follow-up book covering yet another 12 or so libraries.up book covering yet another 12 or so libraries.  <br />	2005-10-10

Jeffrey Masson's latest is a delightful book and a good read for children and adults. He shows us how he and his family learned to live with cats, dogs, chickens, rats, and a rabbit. We learn how,with patience and understanding, these animals gradually come to accept each other.  Why, one wonders, if cats and a bunny can get along, why can't human beings?<br /><br />I was most delighted by Masson's stories about the two rats, Kia and Ora. People tend to despise rats along with bats, spiders, snakes and a few other species.  They are hated and feared so that most people simply refuse to learn anything about them. The hate and fear is passed down from generation to generation and few people care enough to learn more about them.<br /><br />Friends got me over my learned prejudices about rats in my early twenties. They worked in a research lab where they had befriended some of their subjects and brought them home as pets. They had the run of the apartment.  When I stayed there, a couple of them would sleep with me on the couch. They were like small kittens and just as playful and affectionate. Many a morning I would be awakened by the tickle of whiskers, twitching noses, and tiny feet on my neck or cheek.<br /><br /> As usual in his books, Masson's prose is like a friend talking with you, but with plenty of friendly questions and remarks that will make you think.	2005-10-10

Allie and Noah met and spent an, unforgotten summer together where two hearts joined as one. Eventually the summer ended and so did their love. Fourteen years ago, they parted and lost contact. They went on with their lives, but not completely. A piece of their heart remained with each other, they constantly thought about each other, which began the start of a remarkable love story.<br /><br />This is an easy read.  Nicholas sparks, an excellent writer, gets your attention quickly making it hard to put down.  The story begins from Noah telling the story; you are able to feel the emotions. The middle of the book is being told by the narrator, you can still feel the emotions that come along with the book. Then the book ends with Noah reflecting into the past, and telling how he feels, as if remembering everything.  The book is mostly written in Noah's side of view, but Allie's side is shown at critical moments.  I enjoyed reading this book; because it was about the love of two young people who shared the true love they had and realized it was completely unlike any other that either of them had felt. As the book progresses, you can feel the emotional stress and difficulties each are going through. The book shows the lives and thoughts of both young and older people. It also shows, the sides of Allie and Noah, as they grow older, and their lives begin changing, as you can't stay young forever. Although, they are getting older, their love for each other is never ending. They will always be connected in some way, shape or form, whether its memory or heart.	2005-10-10

This remark, I am in no doubt at all, was the basic inspiration, such as it is, of this book from Pratchett.<br /><br />This is the first thing of Pratchett's that I have ever read, and I learn from the dust-jacket that it is one of a series of children's books. My own childhood is a long way behind me, but on the other hand I can remember - or I think I can - quite a lot about it, and I have some idea how this book might have seemed to me at the age of, say, 12. At that age I was devouring science fiction - where, I wonder, is Vargo Statten these days, and what has become of the works of Jon J Deegan? I had probably read all the Just William books by Richmal Crompton by then, and I would certainly have noticed just how strongly Pratchett's formula derives from them, although whether I would have been bothered by that I don't know. The derivative feel of this book certainly bothers me now. Johnny Maxwell's little gang is blatantly based on William's, with Ginger and the rest of them and in particular the alpha-female Violet Elizabeth Bott here replicated in the polyonymous Kassandra/Kirsty/Klytemnestra. There is even an explicit reference to Just William at one point, in case I had been in the slightest doubt. I am also old enough to spot what looks like a rather feeble attempt at imitating Chandler - `men in suits who listened to little radios a lot and wouldn't even trust their mothers'. Back at the juvenile science-fiction level, the mention of golden-haired Atlanteans recalls very specifically the Eagle comic and its series Dan Dare Pilot of the Future - does Pratchett think that we have all died off or have all forgotten?<br /><br />Hawking's abstruse theories are very sensibly reduced to a vague level suitable for the starting point of such a tale. When time is `changed' (know what I mean - changed?) there is not one future from there on but two alternative futures, like a pair of trousers. The catalyst for the change is an elderly female vagrant wheeling around a Tesco supermarket trolley containing bags that somehow do the changing. She seems to be all over the place mentally, but that's because she is everywhen. She dots in and out of different eras, and through their interaction with her Johnny's gang from 1996 are transported back to the blitz in 1941. There is no enormous ingenuity in the way Pratchett handles the theme, perhaps wisely not in a children's story. He is addressing an audience familiar with Dr Who. However one trouser-touch that struck me as odd was that his 1996 kids saw something unusual in the 1941 schoolboy clad in shorts reaching below his knees. Those dressed to the height of casual fashion wear just such apparel in 2005, and so far as I remember were already doing so in 1996.<br /><br />If I were 12 years old in 2005 or in 1996 my guess is that I would have enjoyed the switching between epochs, and I might or might not have picked up the innuendoes regarding changes in racial and gender attitudes. I think I would certainly have felt there was something a little second-hand about too much of the story, and I think I would have awarded it 3 stars.changed?) there is not one future from there on but two alternative futures, like a pair of trousers.

I had read it a few years ago at the recommendation of a novelist friend and enjoyed it immensly.  Unfortunately, I lent out my copy to someone who did not return it.  I wanted to re-read it recently so I went out and bought another copy. I love it even more now than I did the first time I read it. <br />    This novel is a moving journey through the intimate lives of several people.  The protagonist discovers a photograph (as the title implies) of his late wife in an embrace with another man; this discovery sends him on a quest to discover what other secrets his wife had hidden from him.  In the process, skeltons are exposed from the closets of various characters, including the protagonist.   <br />    This book has forever changed the way I see people.  It gives credence to the question of how well we really know someone, regardless of how close we are to the person.  This is my second time reading it and I am quite positive there will be a third, a fourth, and a fifth after that.  It is sobering and very revealing; a work of intelligent, moving fiction. <br />	2005-10-10

While the reader can read the chapters randomly and still find value, the linear approach may give more benefit as the succeeding chapters build on concepts previously introduced. <br /> <br />The author presents a refreshing way to look at project management. His perspective on the value of the vision document and the timing for creating the project schedule reveal some interesting insights. A good vision document can define the domain of a project, form the basis of the requirements, and set the success criteria. In discussing scheduling, he presents research that shows what we suspected all along, that scheduling too early is not only wildly inaccurate, but also hazardous to the success of the project. Although everyone can see that a project is trouble when the deliverables slip, throughout the book the author shares warning signs that indicate that the trouble has already started, and just as important, what can be done about it. <br /> <br />The author's perspective is strongly influenced by his years as a product manager for Microsoft. While your mileage may vary, the book is full of golden nuggets for all PM staff. I suppose that the art of project management is really about understanding what should happen in your project and what is happening (and about to happen), and then using your creativity to bridge the gap. I wish that I had this book to read ten years ago. I think that I could have saved myself quite a bit of agony.	2005-10-10

The folks who publish the Idiot's series must never, ever, insult the intelligence of their reading audience! Religion, by its very nature, is an extremely controversial topic. Regardless, one must never sugar coat the bad at the expense of the truth!<br /><br />For example, I was truly disgusted by the author's obvious sympathy with the Taliban's belief system. First, the Taliban did not represent the vast majority of the Afghani people. As a result, they had no right to destroy the ancient statues of Buddha located in the Bamiyan Valley, period! It doesn't make the statues less important because the depraved British used them for target practice during their attempted invasion in the 19th century. Or, that they were restored in the 1950's at the request of the King of Afghanistan. The author states, from a strictly religious point of view, since no one was worshiping the statues because there have been no Buddhists living in Afghanistan for the past 1000 years, there was nothing wrong in destroying them. According to the author, religious law only allows for the destruction of idols NO longer worshiped. While this restraint is certainly true in some cases, as the 1000 year Muslim occupation of India proved, it was definitely not the situation under the Taliban. Where book burning was plentiful, and the destruction of any artwork, whatsoever, showing the face of a person, was eagerly pursued by these religious zealots.<br /><br />Since the author brings up plenty of history. Lets talk about the huge amounts of violence by Muslims against peoples of all other religions. How can there not be? Conquering one nation after another, in the name of God, or any other reason, for that matter, leads to violence beyond the human imagination. For example, Muslim zeal almost wiped one of the world's great religions off the face of the earth! Anyone hear of Zoroastrianism, lately? The author mentions a \\"treaty\\" by Muslims to protect their shrines. Too bad the \\"treaty\\" was broken, the teachings of Zoroaster have a lot to offer the world.<br /><br />The author does a great disservice to his readers by downplaying the negative aspects of Muslim history. The Muslim people have been as often the oppressors as the oppressed. While the world rejoices that the Muslim rulers had the wisdom not destroy  Hindu religious idols during their 1,000 year rule of India, or the ancient treasures of pharaonic Egypt after their conquest of Christian Egypt, it wasn't their's to destroy in the first place!<br /><br />If one is going to tell a story, tell the whole story, not just one side.

This is a short, honest, informally written, unpretentious and mostly amusing account by and about a once common but now fast disappearing type of socially conscious attorney in our big American cities.  A late sixties graduate of an elite law school, Geoghegan sought to change the world through the court system, to do well by doing good.  Now, some forty years later, he tells us that he settles almost all his civil cases and he details the many ways in which he can't begin to try a criminal one.  Geoghegan has also found it necessary to settle in many other, more important respects.  He makes less than a first year associate at a large firm.  He no longer looks to the courts to upset the status quo.  Even as recently as Clinton, he expected intelligence on the federal bench.  Now he finds less and less--and that was before Harriet Miers called George W the brightest man she ever met! <br />Although the dust jacket suggests otherwise, this is light reading about a number of serious topics.  I think Geoghegan owes us more.	2005-10-10

'Johnny Depp Starts Here' is definitely an excellent resource for the serious film scholar.

Contrary to what a couple of the members of the Left have said here, I don't see this book as being written from the vantage point of hate and anger.  I have read this book and it only confirmed a lot of the things I've come to know over the past four or five years about the Nation of Islam.  Islam is NOT the peaceful, tolerant, loving religion that they claim to be.  The goal of Islam is to convert the entire world to Islam and to do it at the point of a sword.<br /><br />Those that have said that this book is filled with lies and deceit are the kind of people that will tell you that, but be hard pressed to name one concrete example of a lie in the book, showing that they most likely have never even cracked the cover of the book, let alone read it.  These are the same people that will condemn Christianity as being hate filled and worthy of censorship, but at the same time will look you right in the eye and tell you that the average Muslim is a loving, caring and benevolent person, only wanting to live in peace with the rest of the world.  Robert Spencer has shown us in this book that that is an outright fallacy and a very dangerous one at that.<br /><br />It's time for the American people, and non-Muslims around the world for that matter, to wake up and see Islam for what it really is.  A religion based on subjugation, violence, wife-beating and terror.  Mohammed was no more a prophet than Osama Bin Laden.  He was a common thief, murderer, rapist and terrorist.  And we need to wake up to that fact before we have that sword placed at the back of our own necks.	2005-10-10

Benson Lossing was one of the foremost American historians of the 19th century. He wrote various histories on the American Revolution, War of 1812 and Civil War. The personal recollections were actually recorded by Lossing in 1848-1849 as part of research for his famous Pictorial Field Book of the American Revolution. As the fortieth anniversary of the publication of that work neared, Lossing revisited his notes and materials. The result was the twenty-one recounts found in Reflections of Rebellion.  <br /> <br />One wonders about the true accuracy of writings done forty years after the interviews were conducted. These interviews were with men and women who were in their seventies, eighties and nineties and were recalling events from at least sixty-five years prior. That said, this book is highly enjoyable. Lossing's style is much like listening to an experienced storyteller spinning his yarn. The reader gets caught up in the tale and doesn't notice the shortcomings until later when it no longer matters. One thing to look out for is some of the recognizable tales of the war that often turn up in modern histories. Lossing's inclusion of them almost certainly popularized them, making them known to historians who have reused the accounts up to the present.  <br /> <br />The book is highly enjoyable and gave this reader a desire to read more of Lossing's works. Lossing's style meanders at a good pace and is full of information from two historical periods (the period of the subject and the period in which the author himself lived). It is easily evident why this book was chosen to be reprinted. What is a mysterry is why it took so long for its reappearance.	2005-10-10

We're using this book for my advanced rigging class at the Savannah College of Art and Design.  That said, I think it is most certainly not a book for someone who has no experience in 3d.   <br /> <br />I skimmed the modeling section, and the instructions are for a character modeled in NURBS.  NURBS are certainly not what I would suggest modeling in if you're a beginner.  If you've never modeled anything before, I would suggest finding a book that teaches you how to model with polygons first, which I consider much easier to begin with. <br /> <br />As for the rigging section, I will reiterate that you should probably have some idea of how to rig before attempting this.  It has some really good MEL expressions for controlling the rig.  The drawback is that there are some errors in the book that my professor has pointed out and given us solutions for.  This could be a problem if you are trying to teach yourself, as your rig may function strangely or not at all if you don't already understand the basics of rigging.  I know some examples of where there are severe problems with the rig presented and that was with the stretchy spine and the breathing expression (which you annoyingly can't turn off). <br /> <br />I probably wouldn't have bought the book if it hadn't been a requirement for the class.  The instructions and notes that our professor gives us are more helpful than any book and no book can replace actual instruction from another human being.	2005-10-10

This book is an excellent introduction to the evolution-creationism debate. Not only is the book a balanced treatment of an (at least for Americans) delicate issue, but it adds something extra because of the \\"selections from the literature\\". Scott's writing style is pleasant and accessible, making the book a pleasure to read. Nevertheless, I have two critical remarks as to the book (and these are the reason why I don't give the book five stars).<br /><br />First of all, Scott treats creationism as basically a religious position. I agree that creationism has many religious facets. However, as a European, I would like to have more arguments as to WHY creationism is predominantly religious. As for instance Dorothy Nelkin and Christopher Toumey have argued, creationism is as much about science as it is about religion. Perhaps the clash between creationism and evolution is not that creationism tries to smuggle in religious arguments in scientific debates, but that creationists have a different image of science, i.e. a different conception of what science is or should be.<br /><br />The crucial aspect that is lacking throughout Scott's book, is that the real underlying historical issues are missing. Scott argues - as do many - that creationism started around the 1920s. Now, that may be true. However, creationism has a much longer history, since it is rooted in a Baconian view of science, which originates from the early 1800s. From the 1830s to about the 1870s, most scientists in America were creationists! That's something that Scott is unaware of or finds uninteresting. However, in my view those Baconian roots are exactly what the whole evolution-creationism debate revolves around.<br /><br />A second point is that Scott constantly speaks about \\"intelligent design creationism\\", as if it is entirely obvious that intelligent design is a variation on creationist themes. Perhaps to Americans that is so obvious that it needs no further argument. Or perhaps it is merely a rhetorical trick, indicating that we should take ID as seriously as creationism (in other words: ignore it!). Even though I am extremely skeptical about ID (but for theological reasons - I'll leave the scientific arguments against ID to scientists), I would have liked it if Scott would have given some genuine arguments for identifying intelligent design as creationism.<br /><br />However, I don't hope these criticisms will keep anyone from reading this book.  I may seem a bit critical, but I also think that this is a work which deserves to be read widely and discussed critically.that we should take ID as seriously as creationism (in other words: ignore it!).

But the reason for my laughter is that by far the most \\"hatred of anyone who disagrees with them\\" actually comes FROM the Conservatives/Republicans/Right-wingers/Sheep.  I don't know ANY liberals who hate much of anyone (excepting W and his \\"base\\" of small-minded, narrow-minded people who either just prefer to stay ignorant or who truly care more about the desires and preferences of a narrowly-defined group than for humnakind as a whole.  Anyone who pays ANY attention to the policies of the current admin (and similar previous rep. admins) knows that laws and policies favor big-business over public good. <br /> <br />Ok - on to this actual book.  If you're a Republican and you automatically get defensive whenever anyone tries to expose the corruption in your party, then either don't read this book or swallow your defensive comments. <br /> <br />If you're a dem, or an indy - this book uncovers some of the lies, the slight-of-hand and other methods used by W and similar pols to keep people (mostly party members) confused and *thinking* that those in office are doing things for the voters.  Underneath those lies is the stark truth that our country is being totally screwed by the right and they don't give a crap. <br /> <br />Go Blue States!	2005-10-10

When it comes to the militaristic SF there are a few really good authors and without doubt John Ringo is one of them. For an unknown reason you can't buy his books in Poland, however... <br />\\"When the devil dances\\" continues the story of war between Posleen and humans. You can read it alone and if that's the case you'd be surely tempted to read the previous ones... <br />There's a lot of reviews telling what this book is about so I won't do that.

This is a book you will read and re-read throughout your life.  It is first and foremost an incredible eyewitness account of the Pacific War by a ship captain who was intimately involved in many of the key small battles of the war (the major battles were settled by air power, not his area).  It is one of the best written war accounts to come out of any nation. <br /> <br />Secondly, it provides an unique insight into the Japanese at the time that has relevance over the entire 19th and 20th centuries, explaining such things as the origin of the Japanese navy in imitation of the American and British navies...which can easily  be taken as a model for the industrial imitation leading up to Japanese economic superpower status  by the 1980s.   <br /> <br />Finally, Hara is a great autobiographist who shares his heart, displays his heroism and intellect, but does not fail to describe his weaknesses.  Whenever there is a conflict, war or political or business or social, it is good to remember the other side is human too.	2005-10-10

There's an unsolved mystery deep in the ancestral past of Geneva Settle.  It has been 140 years since freed slave Charles Singleton was on the run from authorities, accused of murder and of dabbling in the dangerous social politics of the time.  Is it for this reason, forensic consultant Lincoln Rhymes asks his team, that sixteen year old Geneva was attacked as she researched this puzzle?  Or was it for inadvertently witnessing something that she shouldn't?  Someone out there is determined to get to Geneva, and fast.  Lincoln offers the protection of his home when it becomes apparent that Geneva cannot be left on the outside, even with police protection.    Whoever has put the orders out from above to take Geneva doesn't mind having a little police collateral damage along the way. <br />  <br />Working the scenes via his able bodied partner, policewoman Amelia Sachs, Rhyme is in two minds whether to expend manpower on solving a very old mystery or to concentrate on letting his brilliant mind work its magic on the actions of a killer in the present.  Charles Singleton gave tantalizing clues as to a the discovery of a great injustice to the American people in letters to his family, and it is from examining these that Rhyme is sure that the past is connected to these crimes of the present.  As the team of police and Rhyme sift through the mine of forensic evidence left at the crime scenes of the day they draw closer to finding out why someone would consider a Harlem schoolgirl such a threat that she warrants an immediate execution. <br />  <br />As with all the entries in this series, Rhyme's crew take a scientific approach on the environment and particulars of a crime scene in order to give the police a clearer path to a murderer.  The summary given at the end of each chapter helps the reader to assess and make their own conclusions in a sense of real-time along with the characters.  While the strength of these novels has always been in the details, there is not enough action and intrigue in \\"The Twelfth Card\\" to balance and back up the forensic detailing.  Another failing of this novel is the street language used by the various petty criminals and the school girls themselves.  At best it comes across as dated, at worst, laughable.  While still a tightly plotted crime novel, this read lacks any real pull or sense of suspense and isn't the best representation of an excellent series that has no apparent peer. <br />	2005-10-10

So those wonderful, hardworking chinese apparently went looking for other civilizations and traveled everywhere, but didn't fetch up anywhere with a written history.  They touched down briefly yet changed everything wherever they landed, all without leaving even a smidgen of actual evidence.  They were nearly miraculous in their sailing abilities and sheer resources afloat, yet they wrecked on many a shore, leaving only carved stones that might be nothing and bits of wood that might be a log.  And the only real 'evidence' for any of this are old maps, all of which are ambiguous while others are long-known forgeries.  That and Mr. Menzies assurance that he was there once in a sub, and has seen many a sea chart.   <br /> <br />I'm all about speculative history, but this book is simply too preposterous to be all that entertaining.  I have personal knowledge of only a small part of the ground Menzies covers (I'm a north american archaeologist), and virtually all of the details he mentions that I know something about are inaccurate.  I suspect sloppiness in other areas as well (visa vie the other comments left here), and I can only conclude that Menzies doesn't let facts get in the way of a good sea yarn.  This book may spur interest in an overlooked chapter of euro-centric history so it gets one star, but rarely has so much be made of so little.	2005-10-10

Mr. Lawford's success in recovery is not meant to place him on a pedastal.  He shows us that he does not have all the answers.  With this book he is sharing time and space with others who have been or still are imprisoned by addiction. He does not come to the reader with advice but with stillness, to sit with others who may be in need of someone else who suffers as they do ...  as we all do in one way or another.	2005-10-10

Yet, I expected much more from a man who had risen to the papacy.  One might want to consider the other side of the `John Paul Coin' - Albino Luciani or John Paul I - the valiant champion of human dignity for women, orphans, the remarried, homosexuals and others whose everyday lives are scorned by doctrine. Unlike his successor who was taught from an early age not to question the authority of his ancestors, Albino received his commission to rise to the papacy and bring change to the Church at the age of twelve from his revolutionary activist papa. Two good men - yet, two very different men - two very different sides of the same coin, John Paul II the conservative side and John Paul I the liberal side.

Needless to say, it's now in my own collection.  Why do I like Ms Carlyle's books?  First is her writing style.  It activates my senses as I \\"see\\" the English city I'm walking through, or \\"smell\\" the heather of the Scottish moors.  She develops not only the main characters but also the secondary ones.  I also love the way she weaves in characters from other books.  With each new book you learn a little more about them.  I like that feeling of all the parallel lives going on just like life.  I find myself waiting to find out which of the many characters will have their detailed story told next!  This book has not been a disappointment to me.  The story of Alasdair MacLachian, a charming scroundal we have seen before,  gets his story or comeupence, so to speak, for his one little (prehaps several) sin.  And Esmee Hamilton is the one to exact the punishment!  Their story is heated and humorous with many twists and turns and at times I wondered if it was going to all come out right!  The gypsy gave three readings on that fateful day that started Alasdairs problems, I now have two more stories to look forward to!	2005-10-10

These characters are earthy and real, common folk with endearing foibles and vulnerabilities.  Schaffert breathes life into his characters with a delicate touch, lending a<br /><br />poignant dignity to even the oddest misfit.<br /><br />Hud Smith writes mournful country songs and drinks more than he should.  He lives above the shoe repair shop on the square in a fading Nebraska town but dreams of reconciling with his ex-wife, Tuesday.  Every dream he ever had has fallen through, but despite his dreary life, Hud faces every day with hope and humor.  He plays piano and sings at a nearby Ramada, fending off lonely women who find his music appealing, living for the day his family will be restored.<br /><br />Tuesday's mothering skills are somewhat lacking.  She barely<br /><br />has the energy and drive to supervise their eight year old daughter, Nina. Nina is an irrepressible child who sings off key and makes up graceless dance steps.  Whatever Nina does, Hud finds adorable and brilliant.  He adores his quirky daughter and imagines stealing her away from Tuesday to<br /><br />keep her with him all the time.  Their seventeen year old son Gatling has run away from home to play guitar and sing backup with The Daughters of God, an iconic Christian rock group.  Nina is all Hud and Tuesday have left to remind them of a marriage that once brought joy.  All three dream of having<br /><br />Gatling back home where he belongs and set off in a borrowed schoolbus to find him.<br /><br />Circulating around this mismatched threesome are an equally strange mix of friends, neighbors, and churchgoers who speak their own dark language.  The story is often humorous, but is not a cruel parody of life's rejects.  These are lives made up of large and small failures, joys, and negotiations.  And Schaffert makes them shine.  Highly recommended.	2005-10-10

Horus, His arch enemy, was selected for battle school.  The both learn to become greater warriors and the best of friends throughout their experiences as apprentices.  A foreshadowing war will prepare them for manhood and true friendship. <br />(Review) <br /> I gave this book a 4 stars for a very good reason.  The author, John Flannagan, uses his diction very carefully, and develops a characters personality with great precision and detail.  It is very intriguing to see how the story of young Will and Horus, and how they both are training, and becoming greater men at the same time.  Will is a very small young man, with quick reflexes and intuitive nature, which makes him perfect to become a ranger, but his heart remains with battle school, because his father was a knight, and the conflict starts to begin.  He begins to like the idea of being a ranger, and accepts the fact that it is his destiny to be one.  Horus, Will's enemy in the beginning of the story, also grows as a man.  He comes to realize that his feuding with Will was silly, and becomes great friends with him after Will saves him from a raging boar.  That is how the story develops and becomes even greater as it goes on.  The whole Theme of the story seems to be, that hard work will pay off, and friendship can be found in the strangest of places.  It is more on the childish side, but just like Harry Potter, can be enjoyed by any age group.	2005-10-10

Muller notes that this trend pre-dated Hitler, that the laws enabling it were in the name of national security, that it followed the replacement of liberal with conservative judges over several decades, pre-Hitler, and that the judges had come to accept public affairs as a \\"friend or foe\\" paradigm with no room for loyal opposition.    1933 and post-9/11 are not identical, of course. The 1933 Reichstag Fire Decree suspended numerous civil-liberty sections of the republic's constitution itself, and for all citizens of the republic, while the current U.S. military tribunals simply remove a class of enemy combatants from normal criminal or military jurisdiction. However, the Weimar courts had created courts of special jurisdiction, and types of national-security offenses, long before 1933. Hitler merely took this trend, and the state-necessity doctrine, to its next logical level, and Mr. Muller is very good at putting this in its context. The injustices pre- and post-dated Hitler.    U.S. readers should remember that the German legal system had considerable differences with Anglo-American jurisprudence, with the latter's greater reliance on precedential case law, neutral judges, and independent defense counsel. Still, here we see how a once-proud legal system turned rule of law into a blood-stained rule of force, dressed in legal robes. A valuable, if chilling, work.	2005-10-10

Senior Sergeant Cameron Fraser is the main character in this Australian police procedural by Felicity Young. Fraser, along with his teenage daughter, Ruby, has moved from Sydney to his hometown of Glenroyd to take charge of the local police subdistrict. Here, in more peaceful surroundings, Fraser hopes to come to terms with the deaths of his wife and young son three years before in a deadly fire, one in which Fraser was badly burned trying to save them. He also hopes to protect Ruby and himself from bikie gangs supposedly responsible for the fire that all but destroyed their lives. Unfortunately, his first case in Glenroyd involves a badly burned body, discovered on the grounds of a girls' school, and past horrors are brought back with a vengeance. <br /> <br />Characters in A Certain Malice are well defined and very believeable. From the girls' school, around which much of the action of the book takes place, are principal Anne Smithson, her husband, Jeffrey, and teachers Ruth Tilly and Cecelia Bowman. All appear to have past secrets worth hiding. Fraser's senior constable, Vince Petrowski, is a burly, overbearing cop on the \\"take\\", with many complaints against him. The three other officers in the subdistrict are inexperienced. One, however, a young probationer, Leanne, shows promise. Other well defined characters from the town include Cliff Donovan, a mechanic and head of the local volunteer bushfire brigade, his apprentice, Angelo, and Mrs. Wilmot, a friend's mother from Fraser's childhood.  <br /> <br />Plotting for A Certain Malice is well-thought-out, with enough clues along the way to help the reader solve the mystery. Twists and turns, however, make that discovery difficult, and until the end, I wasn't sure I had the correct solution. I look forward to reading more books by Felicity Young.	2005-10-10

Carla, the always-in-control successful plant manager, already has a life enviable by any standards - a dream job, gorgeous home and hard-working faithful husband - but she wants a child to make it all complete and is willing to risk everything to make it happen despite her husband's assertion it isn't \\"God's will.\\"<br /><br />I must admit, by the time I hit chapter five I'd already begun asking myself, 'What is she doing here?' and furthermore, 'How is she doing it?' Even though I've never had to deal with infertility, her words stirred up feelings in me I couldn't quite pinpoint, and more than a few times I had to stop reading to reflect on the significance of what she'd just said.<br /><br />Then I finally figured it out. It wasn't only how \\"real\\" the characters were (they could be your mother, your sister, your husband, your best friend) but the way she breathed life into them all: characters are as flawed and eclectic as any you'll find in an Anne Tyler novel; her lyrical and poetic prose is every bit as soul stirring as novelist Pat Conroy's; yet - and I emphasize \\"yet\\" - Buckman brings such a unique voice and style to her first novel it elevates fiction to a whole new level. It is all at once funny, emotional, inspirational, page-turning, and, before you're halfway through, will have you rethinking and reflecting on your own life views and attitudes.<br /><br />Be prepared for an extraordinary read guaranteed to lift one's heart far beyond \\"A Piece of the Sky.\\"	2005-10-10

The author likes a kind of design of interiors which is linear and modern. I have nothing against that. What I don't agree about, is that the author tries to convey the message \\"My own style IS FENG SHUI\\". No, that's wrong!   For example, the author clearly advises against clutter. Well, I have seen unpleasantly cluttered, messy homes and I have seen \\"cluttered\\" homes with a great deal of personality and wellcoming, positive energy. I dislike messy homes, but TO ME, the auhtor's style is exceedingly dry, so dry in fact that it reminds me the rooms of an elegant hospital. There is a picture (repeated in the back cover) of a foyer with blaze orange raincoats hanging from a rack along with blaze orange ... binoculars. To my own personal taste that's Kitch, man! The book reflects a manichaean approach all along, and it reaches the very bottom where  plants are listed for being 1) good for feng shui 2) bad for feng shui. This is ridiculous (incidentally, no explanations are provided). Among the plants that supposedly are bad, there are bromeliads and cacti.   The truth is that feng shui arises from an intricate interaction between the outdoor space, the indoor space, and the people who live in there. It's a matter of harmony, sacredness and intention. I was grown with very ancient furnitures and lots of plants of any kind in my parents' home: if you put me in the author's space, I'll get sick (and the other way around, probably). \\"Creating Sacred Space With Feng Shui\\" by Karen Kingston undertakes a much better approach because it favors the idea that the people who live the space should do a lot of thinking and work hard to create the conditions for feng shui. What I see in this book is the author's personal opinion of the \\"ideal\\" interiors dressed up with a little bit of cheap, cheasy, new age.	2005-10-10

Fitzmyer, S.J.<br /><br />I've been reading his stuff for years.  Fitzmyer is scholarly, somewhat dry, and impeccably honest.  His academic credentials are first-rate.  He's one of the major contributors (in partnership with the legendary Scripture scholar Raymond E. Brown) to the New Jerusalem Biblical Commentary, as well as a number of critical commentaries in the Anchor Bible series (including the mighty tome on Paul's epistle to the Romans).<br /><br />In this collections of essays published in 2000, some reworked in a salutary fashion to meet modern standards, Fr. Fitzmyer first sets up his methodology, explaining to the reader how he comes to his conclusions from the weath of data available.  Some of the most interesting essays include \\"The Aramaic 'Son of God' Text from Qumran Cave 4\\" (in which he examines the title \\"Son of God\\" and its various flavors in this Semitic literature), the related article \\"The Background of 'Son of God' as a Title for Jesus\\" (in which Fitzmyer examines the Semitic - as opposed to Greek Septuagintal - context for \\"Son of God\\" in the New Testament in the light of the scrolls), and \\"Qumran Messianism\\" in which the often otherwise oversimplified messianic references are further explored and qualified.  I also enjoyed the \\"Tobit\\" essays inasmuch as they demonstrate the value of what many Christians and Jews consider extra-canonical literature to the keepers of the scrolls.<br /><br />In short, Fitzmyer shoots down both those who say the scrolls have nothing to do with Christianity, and those who say that figures like John the Baptist and Jesus himself show up in coded fashion in those same scrolls.  Fr. Fitzmyer also paints a context in which the Jewishness of what we Christians call the New Testament plays a fundamental role.	2005-10-10

I think I would really enjoy a physics class taught by Mr Baxter, since the man clearly knows his science, knows which sources to go to and is able to synthesize them in ways that he can explain them without your head exploding.  Also, he's able to extrapolate those ideas into some interesting scenarios that suggest some fun possibilities and open the mind up for more speculation.  Alas, he's not able to translate that yet into novels with real emotional heft and the bigger his ideas get, the more the story tends to leave you behind.  This book is the follow-up to Manifold: Time and as the title implies, while this book still requires great leaps in time, this time out we're more about moving outward than jumping forward.  Jumping off the conclusions set by the last novel, Baxter essentially hits the reboot button and drops us in a totally different universe, although some of the characters are still the same.  The most notable is our hero Reid Malenfant, who is older than the first book but just as obsessed with mankind securing their destiny beyond the stars.  Instead of wondering how we're going to survive, however, he's more interested in why they aren't any other intelligent races in the galaxy, or at least why it seems that way.  Meanwhile, an intelligent race does apparently decide to move into the solar system from far away and that's where the fun starts.  Always willing to boldly go (split infinitive and everything), Reid disappears into a portal that was left by some prior alien race and the voyage of discovery begins.  As I mentioned before, Baxter is fiend when it comes to idea and everything is well thought out.  From the weird robot-like Gajin that show up, to all the other aliens that pop in every so often, to the effects of time and history when extrapolated thousands upon thousands of years into the future, it's like he's taking you through an exhibit hall in his mind, showcasing all the fun science-based ideas he has and dressing them up as science-fiction.  However, it doesn't take long before the reader quickly starts to lose the plot and everything begins to drown in a sea of glorious information.  There are gates that allow people to travel but since it's lights-speed, time dilation still applies and when they come back to Earth, it's hundreds of years in the future each time, leading to effects that aren't much different from what the soldier suffered in Joe Haldemann's famous The Forever War, namely culture shock and the sense of dissociation and alienation.  Things progress and Baxter shows us people on the moon, people on different planets, different aliens in other star systems, the galaxy, the picture keeps blowing up bigger and bigger until you almost can't contain it.  But we don't really ever find out what it all means.  The cover copy on the back of the book suggests that the main thrust of the plot has something to do with the reasons why intelligent life flares up and then dies out, leaving artifacts scattered all around the galaxy that other races pick up on, and Baxter sprinkles plenty of hints that the solar system was previously used by other races for various purposes, but it's buried under such a sea of static that it's hard to sort through it all.  Especially since Baxter seems to be acting like an excited child, throwing each new idea in our face almost as he comes up with it, \\"You like this?  Well how about this?  Or this?  Or even this?\\" until you're almost numb from it.  By the time he gets around to answering the central question, almost five hundred pages later, you're been dazzled by as many marvels as science can handle but feeling strangely empty at the same time.  It almost feels like \\"Who cares?\\" and regardless of anything else, I doubt that's the reaction he intended.  Still, he gets an A for effort and the individual moments are extraordinary, showing that he's a mind possessed of a far vision and the fact that he's able to take all this knowledge and assemble it into something resembling a story is amazing in itself.  But when you add it all up, it's not quite everything it's supposed to be.  Hard science junkies will probably eat it up like the candy it is, everyone else looking for slightly more emotional content may find it rough going at times but for anyone who wants to see if all those complicated ideas that involve words with too many letters actually might mean something, well this is as good a place to start as any.thing resembling a story is amazing in itself.

Hull gives an overview of the mechanics and properties of the derivative pricing industry, along with its pricing methodologies, and this book provides an in depth method to one of the pricing methods.    Financial derivatives can be priced by a wide range of methodologies, among some the elegant equivalent martingale measure approach (or risk-neutral pricing), replication, multinomial tree approximation, Monte Carlo simulation, partial differential equations etc etc.    This book gives an excellent introduction, and an insight to the PDE approach.  Although being a big fan of the Girsanov-change-of-measure method myself, these analytical methods often fail in the valuation of highly complex derivatives like the exotics.  Pricing americans prove to be hard and inefficient too, even with simulation and the risk-neutral approach.    This is where PDE methods come in.  Since most derivatives (or term structures) have a PDE describing its evolution, solving the PDE seems to be a good (or sometimes the best) way, no matter how complex the derivative can get.  PDEs on the other hand, have very robust and easy methods for solving.  Therefore, this book brings the reader through basic PDE solving methods, analytical solutions, techniques for fast and efficient numerical approximations as well as rigorous technical explanations for some of the mathematics of partial differential equations (which arise in the financial industry).    The authors are famous for their research in the field of Industrial and Applied Mathematics, and this book continues to be a classic for undergraduates in mathematics in Oxford.  If you want to have an overview of the pde approach to option valuation, without the hassle of learning up Radon-Nikodm and martingales, I highly recommend this book!	2005-10-10

Stark & Woods has a nice selection of exercises, but unfortunately there are no solutions to any of the problems in the book, so you have no way of knowing whether or not you have grasped the material. That is where this outline came in handy. It manages to cover all of the issues in random processes, including basic probability, random variables and multiple random variables, functions of random variables, convolution, estimation and decision theory, and queueing theory.  Chapters five and six on the processing and analysis of random processes are particularly useful to those readers who are interested in applications to signal processing and communications theory. Each chapter has an excellent selection of exercises with solutions to test your knowledge. The only possible drawback of this text is that it often approaches the material from a mathematician's viewpoint more than that of an engineer. Therefore, there are quite a few proofs included as exercises that probably won't be that helpful for students of the applied sciences. The reader should already be comfortable with multivariable calculus as well as linear algebra to get the most from this book. Also, though chapter one reviews probability quite well, this should probably not be your first excursion into the subject. The only difficult part of random processes that I found this book a bit weak on was on the subject of functions of random variables. Again, this is probably because this text takes more of a mathematician's point of view and functions of random variables is more of an engineering subject.	2005-10-10

It's a beautiful description of the wonder of childhood where things known, things imagined, and things intimated collide.  Mamma's village of Tajo and its people are so vividly detailed that one could imagine landing there and identifying every place and everyone on sight.   <br /> In the background lies a narrative of the politics and ideologies of Austria to the north and Italy to the south.  When one thinks of the First World War, one usually pictures the Anglo-French-German trenches of the Western Front.  But here is a description of Tajo as a gathering place of the vast multinational Austrian army that will be sent to fight on the Eastern Front, and whose defeat will permanently change life in the village.	2005-10-10

I bought it after reading the author's newsletter for a while and finally decided to give it a try.  I have other systems I'd bought online for hundreds of dollars that were useless so needless to say I was skeptical. <br /> <br />It lays out a series of excellent prospecting techniques (it's actually grassroots marketing for salespeople) along with excellent instructions on how to implement each technique and work them into a 'system of systems' as the author calls it. <br /> <br />Anyway I tried out a few of the techniques, after a week or so leads started coming in and after a couple of months I was able to get rid of cold calling as I then had more than enough calls coming in to keep my schedule full of appointments!  After being at 67% and on probation I'm now at 114% and all with no cold calls!  If you are in sales, you need this system, believe me it is worth far more than the price!  On top of the prospecting system it is full of excellent general sales advice.	2005-10-10

This is a good guide to brain-tech, and really the only one that serves it's purpose.  It is, as other reviewers have mentioned, quite dated, and there are many products out on the market now which just aren't in this book.  Obviously, however, an intelligent consumer can supplement their reading of this book with research on the web to find out about the products that are out now.  I discovered the floatation tank, CES, integrated motion systems, smart drugs, sound tables and many other useful tools through this book.  I got started in all this stuff by buying a light and sound machine from a magazine advertisement, 15 years ago, and until reading Megabrain I didn't know about the other stuff.  CES has greatly enhanced my life, and soon I'm going to buy a floatation tank now that I can afford it.  Simply put, there is no other book that concentrates all of these and other items into one single book.  That is why this is the only book that is going to make people aware that so many of these things exist.  For example:  I know plenty of people who are aware of the floatation tank, but not aware of CES.  I also know people who are aware of light and sound machines, but not aware of floatation.  This is why, no matter how dated the book is, it's going to remain a classic for those who might potentially become true connoissieurs of brain-tech, and indispensible to the explorer who is just beginning.  The writing style is admittedly, very periodical-like, however I don't see a problem with this since it is basically a consumer guide.  The book shouldn't really attempt to tell you every little thing you can do with each and every gadget, it can only give you a bit of the theory behind each product, and give you a general idea of what it does.  I do think, however, that the author should consider coming out with a new edition or perhaps start from scratch with an entirely new book that fulfills the same purpose.	2005-10-10

Many who have been interested in Marx read 'The Communist Manifesto' an admitedly dated work and never go beyond it. It must be remembered the Manifesto was a simplified form of practical ideas printed to drive the working class to action.<br /><br />Marx was a student of Hegel, a notoriously difficult and deep philosopher to understand, but it shaped Marx to a degree that few understand. Marx was more than an economic philoshpher, he was an astute observer of psychology, sociology and anthropology. All of his philosophy shines in clarity in the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844.<br /><br />Of all of Marx's works we see most the thesis and theory devised from his understanding of the human condition through historical analysis. This work is the most accessable, easily understood work by this great thinker. If you have the desire to truly understand a major influence for the framework of many socialized democracies of modern Europe, the drives for nationhood and equality that rocked Europe in revolt in 1848 or desire to truly understand the whole theory of Marx this small book is an absolute must.<br /><br />Marx was a both a materialist and process theorist in philosophical terms. His later socio-econmic works were a sort of working blueprint based upon the historical, psyhcological, sociolgoical, economic and anthropologic theories laid down in this work.	2005-10-10

I recall reading this story and making a connection to another book editied by the same person, \\"Annies Baby.\\" As soon as I started the similarities jumped out...both of these girls in the stories were 14, and met an older man they thought was the light of their life, their dream come true, only to find hes both a rapist and a vile person...both have their mother as a solid figure in their life, and both have to make some incredible descisons. Unlike \\"Annies Baby\\", however, this one has a sadder, yet more mature feel to it. Insted of dealing with a pregnancy, Nancy is handed her death sentance in her prime of life. The incurable AIDS. I perfer this story to the other, due to its mature nature and how it gives a better persepctive on some serious difficulties of dealing with death. It has the air of a cautionary tale, but in this story it isn't shoved down our throats, which is admirable in this age. I highly recommend this book, because it holds accurate information, and an inrapturing and ultimatly tragic story.	2005-10-10

Anyone interested in human rights or morality should read this.	I will never forget this book; it is a difficult and at times terrible book to read. Dallaire tells the story of his experiences in Rwanda as the lead man in the U.N. Peacekeeping mission. As the horrible events in Rwanda unfolded, he pleaded with the UN and its powerful members to help with troops, equipment, everything and got very little and was unable to prevent the massacre of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 100 days. He describes the chaos of the situation in gripping and harrowing detail. Though I had read Gourevitch and Powers works on the subject, I was shocked by the raw power and emotion of this first-hand account. Dallaire is unsparing in his criticism of the UN and the US, claiming that if they had acted more quickly thousands of lives could have been spared, an allegation that gains support from Clinton's similar admission of regret in his recent autobiography. Anyone who is interested in human rights or the preventable holocaust in Rwanda would be highly advised to read this book--but be prepared to be disturbed and shaken. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

What is missing is any kind of objective analysis, fawning praise taking its place. Terry was a good guy, but that doesn't mean he was a great writer.<br /><br />As Hill points out, it is difficult to assess Southern as a writer because so many of his collaborators claim credit for much of what he did (e.g., Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda on \\"Easy Rider\\"). Thus, his reputation has to rise or fall based upon a few major works -- \\"Flash and Filigree,\\" \\"Candy\\" (coauthored with Mason Hoffenberg, a junky), \\"The Magic Christian,\\" \\"Red Dirt Marijuana,\\" and the screenplay for \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" (for which Stanley Kubrick also claimed credit). Lee Hill concludes that \\"The Magic Christian\\" is the best of these. I generally agree, although there is a story in \\"Red Dirt Marijuana,\\" titled \\"Razor Fight,\\" that is on a par with anything Hemingway wrote.<br /><br />Terry's son, Nile, has published a collection of his shorter works, \\"Now Dig This: The unspeakable writings of Terry Southern\\" that provides additional indications of greatness and is well worth purchasing.	2005-10-10

This was something with a decidedly different look.  Oh sure, there's a beautiful, nude woman on the cover, but upon opening up the book I was surprised at what I found there.  Walter Girotto was a totally unknown artist to me until I got this book.  Girotto is an Italian artist who came to the United States back in 1985.  I hesitate to categorize him as a pin-up or erotic artists, although his work certainly has those qualities.  But Girotto is something more.  Working in oils, pastels, even crayon and colored pencil, his work produced on wood gives it an aged, textured, grainy look.  He blends a Renaissance period look with 21st century eroticism to create a completely unique style.  Going beyond traditional pin-up art, Girotto's work really classifies as fine art.<br /><br />His different methods and tools produce some startling work, and it's really unlike anything I've ever seen.  Take the piece simply called \\"Nude 30\\" showing a radiant blonde that was finished with colored pencil on prepared paper.  I don't think that paper was prepared for Girotto!  \\"Shauna Wearing Red Boots\\" features the beautiful subject lying nude on a divan clad in only red boots.  These pieces complement his smooth, soft style perfectly.<br /><br />I love a painting called \\"Unconcerned\\" in which Girotto combines oils and pastels on this seductive woman with full, pouty lips and eyes closed.  \\"Love Temptation\\" seems derived right out of the 1500's with the nude blonde subject holding a bunch of pink roses while a cherub hovers over her shoulder.  Julie Strain has never looked quite so refined as she does in \\"Julie Strain Portrait\\" showing the scream queen amidst of Renaissance Era sculptures with a cherub lying at her feet.<br /><br />Throughout the 100 plus page collection you'll find yourself mesmerized at this incredibly talented artists who has taken eroticism to a whole other level.  The book is printed on slick, glossy stock.  Fantastic!<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonlented artists who has taken eroticism to a whole other level.  The book is printed on slick, glossy stock.

There's little mention of race and phenotype; these a covered in a single chapter. Here's Coon having a go at social anthropology as opposed to physical anthropology. It is my favourite book by this scholar. Coon is also a good writer, capable of drawing the reader with a compelling narrative.   <br /> <br />This book is about human history starting with the first Homo Sapiens and ending with the Cold War (it was published in the early 50s). Every invention, from the digging stick to television is traced and analyzed.  Coon takes you from the Palaeolithic through the Neolithic into recorded history, chronicling man's technological evolution as a consequence of the climactic chaos of the Ice Ages.  <br /> <br />Coon believed that Man's problems stem from the retention of the Neolithtic mentality that says: 'you stay in your illage; I'll stay in mine'. You also learn that Coon was a sort of proto-environmentalist, as well. He believed we were destroying our planet with pollution. In `The Hunting Peooples,` Coon takes a more overt environmentalist tone.	2005-10-10

His lucid writing style, coupled with the fore-mentioned personal accounts, rivet the reader. This book is hard to put down once you begin reading it.<br /><br />Coffin traces the regiment from its inception to its mustering out shortly after the Battle of Gettysburg, where three of the five regiments were instrumental in turning back Pickett's Charge, as well as the supporting attack by Lang's Floridians and Wilcox's Alabama brigade. Spiced by the first-person accounts, the book offers the reader an interesting perspective on the frustrations, fear, boredom, anger, and anxiety brought about by soldiering. Coofin judiciously mixes narrative on troop movements, battle flow, and organizational matters with anecdotes and vignettes that personalize the life of the Second Vermont Brigade.<br /><br />All in all, Coffin's book is a must-read for anyone even remotely interested in Pickett's Charge and its repulse, as well as as for anyone interested in Nine-Minths Regiments and Vermont Civil war troops. This is among the best brigade histories that I have ever read! Well recommended!	2005-10-10

I saw the photo exhibit at Copia in Napa in early 2005 and was taken by the wonderful photographs of families from around the world behind a table or blanket on the ground with their week's supply of food.  There was also an analysis of the food content and cost.  As one who studies the role of food in health and disease, I could see how what was on the table or blanket was related to the health of the family or, more generally, the entire country.  There was, for example, the portly Australian family with the mother who had suffered a stroke near age 50 years, sitting behind a table piled high with over 50 pounds of meat plus 4 gallons of dairy products, 4 gallons of sugar-laden drinks, etc., but very few \\"healthy\\" foods.  It was very easy to see why she was over weight and developed a stroke.  The Chinese village family, on the other hand, had only 20 pounds of meat but 47 pounds of fruit and over 50 pounds of vegetables, and they were much thinner.  The foreword by Marion Nestle, one of America's leading nutritionists, discussed the ills of overeating easily possible in today's world.  The photos, which go way beyond those seen at Copia, showing more about every day life in the cities and villages, and the text, explaining the role of food and agriculture, are excellent.  For the scientifically minded, there are data on health and food in the back of the book.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the role of food in health and disease and life.	2005-10-10

Last Saturday, I took Math Level 2 exam. For its preparation, I used this book and Barron's. It turned out that the combination of these two books worked pretty well. Of course, this book is way harder than the real SAT II exam, however, it prepares the test takers for concept building of difficult requestions. <br /> <br />Thanks to Mr. Meylani and Barron's prep book, I am supposed to get between 720 and 750.	2005-10-10

When I read it over in the bookstore, it seemed more informative and fun than it was once I got it home; perhaps my excitement over a Yule book tainted my opinion.  <br /> <br />The crafts seemed tacky, the recipes were unimaginative and the content about Yule and how it relates to witchcraft was pretty much non-existent. It was nice to have a book that addressed Yule and Yuletide and I liked the December daily calendar. However, it wasn't what I'd hoped it would be and I got very little use out of it in the end.	2005-10-10

A shipload of pirates, serving the 13 original American Colonies as Privateers, help bring Christmas to Savannah, Georgia, before the British invasion. The book is mainly told from a young boy's view. The two youngest crew members, and Lucky (the ship's dog mascot), teach kids American history in such a way that they never realize they are soaking up information.  <br /> <br />The authors tell the difference between Pirates and Privateers, as well as, the difference between Loyalists and Patriots. The crew rescues a white dolphin, engage in combat, rescue a lady and her daughter, and even bring the Christmas spirit to Savannah. Kids of today can see how the kids of yesterday lived day-to-day. They will even learn about cobblestones!  <br /> <br />***** The captain is an intelligent white man who actually cares for his crew and their safety. There is a black officer who offers a glimpse into what is going on with African Americans during that time. There are some very well done illustrations throughout the book to help children visualize the events as they unfold. All-in-all, the story has a little bit of just about everything and will entertain (and quietly teach) kids much about life in the late 1700's. Highly recommended reading. ***** <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-10-10

This book will make you laugh, cry and take a real look at yourself and your relationship to others and to Jesus Christ. I fell in love with Pastor Rogahn. He covers everything from gossip to sin to nonconformists to making fun of others without sounding as though he's preaching. This would make a great book for teens to study together in youth groups, discussing one of Pastor's topics each week. The author makes you feel as though you're right there in the pastor's library with them arranging the books. This is a wonderful true story of the friendship between a troubled young girl and her pastor. Great book for teens or for anyone who would like a refresher course on what it really means to be a Christian.	2005-10-10

Having read several biographies of Presley, including Bobbie Ann Mason's (another wonderful Southern writer) Penguin Lives' look at the rock & roll icon, I think Diane Thomas has captured the very young singer perfectly -- the heart and soul -- before Col.

I laughed out loud when reading her tongue-in-cheek humor while absorbing all the information she was sharing. She fully explains her 12 week exercise regimen with photographs and illustrations, and then also gives the reader derivatives of those exercises so that one can vary their workout as recommended. <br /> <br />I completely recommend this book.

I FEEL HER as the young people say. <br /> <br />I still, however, think that Kola Boof is the most important new VOICE in Black women's literature.  Sure she's raw and unorthodox, but she's more powerful than Zadie and Z.Z.  I put Zadie Smith and Z.Z. Packer just a little behind Boof in revelancy and a LOT BEHIND in daring.  But it's very exciting right now watching the young new girls in black literature strut their stuff. <br /> <br />Don't miss ON BEAUTY.  It's worth your time. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10
US	15775323	R3VLITYP0AUG43	0916938166	962618718	Easter: Is It Pagan?	Books	1	10	20	N	Y	Mr. Woodrow will confuse folks...unless they know about slight of hand...SADLY	Being willing to see if i missed anything with regards to Easter and Christmas, and the thought process of celebrating them or not, and seeing a few comments on the Internet about how \\"brave and bold\\" Mr. Woodrow was for turning his position around, i purchased several (5 or so) of his newest booklets.  After reading through Brother (yes i said Brother) Woodrow's booklets of \\"Easter Is It Pagan\\" and \\"Christmas Reconsidered\\" i've reached the following conclusion.  Brother Woodrow is using the famous \\"straw-man argument methodology\\" that writers, salesmen, speakers, and even magicians utilize.  When i entitled this \\"slight of hand\\" i didn't mean that Mr. Woodrow was being purposefully deceptive, i meant he moves the reader from their grounded truth and the reader can end up worrying about the detailed scarecrow.  You bring up something interesting, focus on it INSTEAD OF the plain truths, and eventually folks forget the plain truths they held dear.  A straw-man (scarecrow) was put in the fields and gardens so those who came looking for food, became distracted by the straw-man and either left the area or concentrated on the straw-man.  Hopefully, leaving garden and fields alone was the achievement.  In addition to straw-man usage ALL throughout the booklets, Mr. Woodrow leaves out many things defined by dictionaries and encyclopedias CONVENIENTLY, and only posts the parts which support his opinion that Easter and Christmas are simply godly holidays.  He often goes back-and-forth, sometimes saying \\"no pagan connection, no harm\\" and then \\"let's assume it COULD be pagan, what harm now??\\"    The God of Israel (and Jesus therefore) has made it clear, it's a \\"no-no\\" to mix OR REPLACE His Holidays (religious) with other's invented/created/inherited/derived holidays.  Brother Woodrow is distracting from, or side-stepping, these issues.  Brother Woodrow takes you through straw-men single-sided arguments such as word histories and even emotional stories of the celebrations of Christmas and Easter.  Our God doesn't ignore mixing religious holidays (or any syncretism!!) of other nations/peoples with His Holidays, and He MOST DEFINITELY DOESN'T like you to use a secular-based holiday instead/over-top of His Appointed Times/Holidays (Holy Days).  There is no way around this.  God expects you to do the BEST YOU CAN with what you know (keep learning of HOW to pursue & please & obey Him & HIS CHOICES OF HOW we are to worship & love Him) in following His Instructions.    I wrote these (items below) down in both booklets, in case anybody ever picks them up and reads them, to help people QUIT LOOKING AT THE STRAW-MAN and instead keep reading/searching from a firm foundation of Biblical Truth and Patterns.  Hopefully these help others if i post them here, to think thru things.    1. if a practice (pagan/non-pagan words or traditions) arises that replaces the LORD'S Appointed Times, Practices,Observances & Words (instead of, in lieu of, similar but separate from...), GOD forbids it!  2.  if a term today comes from words that are NOT pagan in nature or ritual or origin, WHO CARES!  3.  if a term today comes from words that ARE PAGAN in nature, & you are NOT practicing or doing them (any of their associated rituals), WHO CARES!  4.  if a term today comes from words that ARE PAGAN and rituals or honor is somehow showed to it (extended from it, & whether in ignorance or intentional) and practiced, GOD CARES!!  5.  Questionable origins can be debated (perhaps), but replacement holidays CANNOT.  Association can be debated, & ignorance too, but NOT merging or replacing!  6.  We are NOT to follow the FALLEN WAYS of the nations (around us).  7.  We are not to knowingly speak the names of the \\"false gods\\" out of our mouths knowingly, or present before the God of Israel, in ANY honoring/worshipful/celebratory way.  8.  Linguistics & superstition are NOT the focus, it's practice that has religious ties (PRACTICING IT/HONORING IT SOMEHOW) that's the focus and theissue at hand.  9.  We are to be Holy people, and Holy simply means \\"set-apart,\\" in word and in deed, the BEST WE CAN.  We aren't to take in the habits of others with regards to religious holidays, and look similar to them while saying \\"praise God!\\"    Hope this helps you or others.  Please do not waste your monies on these two booklets by Brother Woodrow about Easter and Christmas being \\"harmless\\" and \\"okay\\" and \\"Holy and acceptable to God.\\"  At the SAME TIME, please be gentle with the Brethren who don't have any CLUE about the origins and replacement days they are observing, you will only cause needless division if you bark at them.  Lead by example, in ALL obedience to the God of Israel, don't hit others over the head with the Bible.  The Holy Spirit is well equipped to do any convicting <smile>.     Finally, if you don't understand that Believers in Jesus the Nazarene (Yeshua HaNatzeret)were taught by the Master that they need to Have His testimony of being our Salvation (spiritually now, physically to come!) AS WELL AS THEY NEED TO obey His commandments (we need to obey the Torah/Instructions of the God of Israel), then you will struggle with the whole idea of following God's instructions in these areas. Some searching on the Internet for what it means to have the testimony of Jesus (Yeshua)and keeping the commandments of God, will  help you out.  Just use maturity, and avoid immaturity when doing so.    Grace and Peace to you in our Beloved Messiah,  Fredrick Murphy	2005-10-10

A fun "Beach Read"	If you can suspend your expectation of what reality is- this is a great book. It is fun, fast moving, and exciting.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt is an amazing hero. As one reviewer wrote he is a combination of the Terminator, Indiana Jones, and James Bond rolled into one. He is never afraid and calm in the worst circumstances. He saves the lives of his friends and himself many times over in this book alone. AND he gets the girl.<br /><br />Most importantly he is fairly well off and has a great job with a government agency that seems to have unlimited funds and resources at hand.<br /><br />Once you get over saying 'Yeah right' with disbelief, you will enjoy reading this book. It is a fun book. The plot line moves quickly, the rest of the characters are believable and the setting is fantastic.<br /><br />Basically this book begins when Dirk Pitt and his friend rush to a sink hole to save two diving archeologists. In the course of saving them from certain death they learn of an ancient golden treasure that has been lost. They learn they might be able to find it. At the same time some crooked men are learning about this treasure and gathering clues towards finding it as well. And the race is on.<br /><br />Again it is a fun beach read that moves fast. I enjoy all of the Dirk Pitt novels and look for more. I think they are worth the money.<br /><br />Enjoy.	2005-10-10

It must be noted that exploitation and conservation measures are much more heavily discussed than is ecology, which is even less uniform across the species covered than the former two aspects.  Case studies do figure heavily in this book, which makes it somewhat biased towards species considered, but this can only be expected due to the paucity of literature on actual implementations (for direct river turtle exploitation and conservation).<br /><br />The third chapter alone, which features major river turtle guilds of the world, is worth the purchase price in and of itself.  The functional summarization-nature of this book, as with the previous title of paralleled nature noted above, will likely cause it to remain an important volume for decades to come.<br /><br />One star was subtracted in this review to get your attention (the ole newspaper misprint trick).  This book's delivery mandates its inclusion in the book list of every individual concerned with this topic.	2005-10-10

It is filled with the musings of Yamamoto Tsunetomo (1659 - 1719), a samurai retainer of the Nabeshima Clan who later became a Buddhist monk. Translated as \\"In the Shadow of Leaves\\" the various anecdotes cover everything from dying properly to how to avoid yawning in public. The Hagakure was once a secret text known only to the samurai vassals of the Hizen fief. Consequently this is translation offers unique insight into feudal Japan. It's not the easiest reading style-wise, but I suspect that is a result of the translation process.

As always, she is concise, witty, and apropos. The strength of this book lies in the author's ability to summarise the various theories and evaluate them. I particularly enjoyed her evaluation of Chomsky through the introduction of his grammar to \\"Jupiter's stick insects.\\"<br /><br />Jean Aitchison is quickly becoming my favourite linguistics writer for her ability to explain complex linguistics points with ease. Some mammals tend to be more articulate than others; indeed some tend to obfuscate rather than articulate. Aitchison is clearly more articulate than most.	2005-10-10

Wright intersperses the raw emotion of personal experience with the intellectual contributions of the greatest thinkers throughout history to worry at the biggest question of them all: what is the point of life?  He writes, particularly when talking of his own experience, with a kind of sparse lyricism in the tradition of Thomas Hardy, and it is surprisingly affecting.  Wright pulls off the double coup of a book that is both aesthetically and intellectually satisfiying, and rather than offering any answers, provokes the reader to ask what life means to them.	2005-10-10

FBI agent Joe Pistone's credentials are impeccible.  Having lived and worked with wiseguys for six years, he's the only FBI agent in history ever to penetrate this organization to the extent he did. Incredibly,he was only a few months away from becoming a full-fledged member of the mob - a made guy.  If you are a soccer mom offended at realistic language and the ways of the street, forget about it: go watch your soap operas while wolfing down a tub of candy-coated popcorn.  On the other hand, if you want to know what makes wise guys tick; what, why and how they think, this book is a must.  This book is highly informative, entertaining and hard to put down. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

If the book was designed with SQL Server in mind then the book should have been designed for this version. I think the author should have made different versions for different DBMS, this way the book would be more effective. If the book was going to be used for all databases then they should have included the commands used for each DBMS. Otherwise why include a step by step if not all the commands are going to work. The book is however, very well written and easy easy to follow, but there are parts of the projects that become rather difficult to follow because the book doesn't include the commands for your DBMS. In addition, the book doesn't include a DBMS program nor does it suggest what is the best program to use with this book. <br /> <br />Rating the book from 1 to 5 I would give it a 3. The lack of 2 points is mainly because there are parts in the book that doesn't work with the DBMS. If I wasn't using SQL Server I would give it a much lower number. <br />	2005-10-10

This is a highly riveting account of the only FBI agent in history, Joe Pistone, ever to be proposed for membership in the mob. For six years Pistone worked and lived with made guys - hardcore mobsters who do not tolerate mistakes, idiots or rats (informers). This hard-hitting, real-world account takes you deep inside the thoughts, lives and actions of these individuals.  Some have reported that the language and descriptions within this book are too much.  This ain't Disneyland, ya know.  Pistone's writing style places you in the middle of the fire from the very first page and holds you there until the end. For his end, Pistone possesses nads of solid boron, one of the hardest metals known to mankind.  Second by second, for six long years, Pistone was in effect a mobster.  He stayed alive by his magnificent acting ability, fortitude and unadulterated guts.  In spite of the hardships for himself and his family, who he rarely saw during this time, he stuck it out to the very end when the FBI had to end the operation because Pistone was scheduled to make a hit.  The mob was caught off guard and there was indeed hell to pay.  My only complaint about this book is that it was not long enough.  I could have read on for days.	2005-10-10

He describes the mindset of complacency that seized hold of Israel after its easy victory in the Six Day War.  This \\"konzeptsiya\\" held that the Egyptians and Syrians would not go to war for years to come in the wake of that stinging defeat. It was a logical, coherent, well-thought out mindset ...but it was wrong. <br /> <br />I've read some about the war, but Bar-Joseph's book is full of new revelations: <br /> <br />-the identity of the high-level source who gave the Mossad a definitive warning of Sadat's intent to attack in October 1973 <br /> <br />-the fact that although Israel had obtained the Arabs' tactical battle plans on both the Egyptian and Syrian fronts, the Israeli commanders either did not exploit or were unaware of this hard won knowledge (which reinforces a central belief of mine:  the best intel in the world is useless if people aren't allowed to see it and make use of it) <br /> <br />Perhaps even more important than revelations such as these is Bar-Joseph's discussion of various cognitive and analytic errors that the Israelis fell victim to.  The one that I found most interesting was the proposition that the head of Israeli military intelligence and his favorite analyst both were personalities that favored \\"closure\\" to a dangerous degree (in other words:  they did not like being uncertain and once they had made their minds up, they resisted changing them until almost the very end). <br /> <br />To sum up, this is a wonderful addition to the literature of intelligence books out there.  Given the fact that it happened just three decades ago, it is probably more pertinent and accessible to today's readers than earlier books about Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br />So I congratulate the author and encourage my colleagues in the IC to read this as well as anyone else with an interest in why intelligence failures like the 1973 War happen.	2005-10-10

The first chapter alone is a must read for everyone you know, and could change your life.  About how the kinds of stories we tell can be paradigm-shifting.  Deals with the romanticized notion of native americans (see also Edward Said's book ORIENTALISM), how an invented idea of \\"indian\\" has been used and abused by the u.s. in hypocritical ways, and how the stories we hear and tell about ourselves shape our identity.  Lots of very sad facts about native american history in its relationship with the US government.  The book is set up in a kind of spiral with a recurring story told in different ways at the beginning of each chapter.  This book is really for everyone - not just those with an interest in native americans.  The stories we are telling in America today are globally destructive and negative - let's start fresh with some positive stories to turn this country around - we are all on this planet together.	2005-10-10

Having read \\"Lost Queen\\" by Norah Lofts, which book was a work of historical fiction that covered much of the same story told by this author, there could not be two books more different, though both are riveting. The major difference is in the writing style. The book by Ms. Lofts is superlative and tells an interesting, intriguing, though somewhat superficial story about the love triangle consisting of the mad king of Denmark, Christian VII, his wife, Queen Caroline Mathilde, and the royal physician, Johann Struensee. This author, on the other hand, rips the reader's guts out with its angst filled, staccato telling of the same story. It is a more literary book than that of Ms. Lofts and compelling in its own way, a beautifully written work of historical fiction that will keep the reader riveted to its pages until the very end.<br /><br />It, too, tells the story of Princess Caroline Mathilde of England, sister to King George III. At the age of fifteen she was wed to young King Christian VII, who eventually became known as the mad king of Denmark. Temperamental, high strung, and given to strange outbursts, his predilection for odd behavior was known early on, but despite this the two kingdoms would still see these two wed, as the unification of England and Denmark was more important than individual happiness.<br /><br />King Christian VII was a truly pitiable figure who had survived a childhood fueled by rank cruelty and was easy prey for the sycophants of the Danish court. He developed a peculiar aversion to his wife and, consequently, had conjugal relations with her only once, which propitiously resulted in the birth of a son nine months later. Alone in a foreign country, whose language she was only beginning to learn, and estranged from a King surrounded by sycophants, the young queen gravitated to the one person who treated her as a person in her own right, the King's physician, Johann Struensee.<br /><br />An advocate of the philosophy of Enlightenment that was overtaking Europe, the idealistic Struensee had many ideas that were introduced as reforms in Denmark, through his influence with the King, who by now was easily led, since his madness left a void in leadership that Struensee was all to happy to fill. These reforms were to make many enemies for him, as they upset the established feudal system that still existed in eighteenth century Denmark. As he gained power through his influence, resentment against him grew within those circles that had formerly been close to the King. Unaware of the growing animosity against him and lacking political canniness, Struensee and the Queen became close intimates, bound by shared ideas and interests.<br /><br />Struensee's relationship with the Queen, who was lonely and starved for affection, eventually transgressed the bounds set by propriety. Now lovers in fact, their relationship became grist for the rumor mill. She even gave birth to a daughter who the King acknowledged as his own but who was actually Stuensee's. As gossip and innuendo about their relationship swirled across royal circles in Europe, it ultimately became the focal point for a political coup that saw them both arrested and charged with treason. It was a relationship that was to have great personal and political ramifications for the protagonists, as well as for Denmark. What ultimately happened to each of them was tragic, governed as it was by the initial reluctance of the Danes to give up their feudal system. Even those whom Struensee championed through his reforms, the peasant class, turned against him in the end.<br /><br />This is the French text edition of \\"The Royal Physician's Visit\\", a richly atmospheric work of historical fiction, filled with political intrigue, historical personages and events, shadowed by darkness and a palpable sorrow apparent in each and every one of its pages. It is as if the individual psyche of each of the protagonists were driving the book, giving it texture, shadings, and glimpsesinto the psyche of those involved in this high drama. It is an angst filled, almost surreal, rendering of lives that were to come together and leave a mark on the world, making for a story that to this day has the power to captivate the reader.

I started reading on the plane and the time flew by, pun intended.   After arriving, I found that I couldn't put the book down, and because of the time change, I stayed up late at night reading chapter after chapter, somehow hoping that things would work out for Chris.  He put his life on hold to raise someone else's children, and denied himself personal growth that most achieve by interacting with the world at large.  I would liken this novel to a feel good movie- after reading, you have a smile on your face and it is a welcome break from the real world, where life just doesn't work out so neatly and lovely.  Be advised that at times, one has to suspend reality while reading this book because too many things work out just too perfectly.  But this is a great work of fantasy, for how things could be, good versus evil, turning the other cheek, moving on after a failed relationship, etc.   Chris was a pretty pathetic person in the beginning and at times I wasn't sure if I wanted to hug him or slap him.   One thing is for sure, no matter what your personal viewpoints are, Chris will do or say many things that will annoy you!   But his viewpoints make the reader think about a number of issues and justify his position. <br /> <br />The one reviewer who didn't care for the book must have been younger....those of us who are 40-or-more something grew up in a different era, where people who were \\"that way\\" were only talked about in hushed whispers, if at all.   The old attitude in the south was that there are no gay people and if there are, polite people do not discuss such things, end of story.  The universal acceptance, especially \\"down at the beach\\", is not a reality.   But then again, when gay men take an all-gay cruise to be totally accepted, that isn't much of a reality either, only a temporary escape from the day to day grind of a life lived in the face of homophobia and ignorance.   And when was the last time you saw a Hollywoodmovie or television show that had any semblance of reality? <br />  <br />I was very fortunate to have met the author on one occasion and he writes very much like he talks!   He has a particular style of story telling that is very southern and engaging.   I have read all his books, but I would imagine that non-southerners might have a tough time with some of the prose.   I do admit that I encountered more typos and grammatical errors than I am accustomed to, but I also noticed that some of the sentences, upon a second read, were not really in error but were just colloquialisms or staccato speech of a very southern variety; it is up to the individual reader to decide if this manner of speech is charming or distracting.  The smoking was a prevalent theme, however, this too is sadly another case of art imitating life, especially in the Carolinas.  The religion was omnipresent, and I did feel like at least on some level, it represented a hidden anti-promiscuity agenda.   And for straight readers, please take this book for what it is- a work of fiction about one man's journey; not all gay men are so easily swayed by a younger woman, although youth does have a strong appeal in some segments of the gay community.   Also, not all gay men want to imitate the heterosexual marriage ideal of 2.5 children and a station wagon (even if the wagon happens to be a Mercedes or BMW).   Chris is not ashamed of his sensitive, nurturing, feminine nature or his passive sexual proclivities any more than his butch lovers are ashamed of their own assimilated mannerisms.  While some may say that this image perpetuates stereotypes, one has to remember that stereotypes exist because for some segment of a given population, the stereotypes hold true.   I think the message to be taken from this novel is that everyone is different, with lives that revolve around different priorities and desires, and that life can drastically change in the blink of an eye and the strong adapt and grow.   The book isfull of symbols that seem to have been lost on some readers.   For example, the dog's death also symbolized the final gasp of the 22-year \\"marriage\\".  Some people become very attached to pets, and they really are part of the family. <br /> <br />Visiting the outer Banks today, one would be hard pressed to find Chris' world of desolate beaches and barren barrier islands.   The area still exists but has become overrun by tourons and transplants.   From my experience, not even the hordes of transplants can change the limited viewpoint of the locals. <br /> <br />I have read everything that Jay Quinn has published and enjoyed each and every work for its unique outlook and incorporation of southern sensibilities.  The wide range of comments are a tribute to the author's talent and ability to be thought provoking.  I anxiously await the next release from Jay Quinn. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

But on top of that she creates characters that the reader truly wants to know and care about.  Although part of series I still feel that this read is a stand alone in it's own right.  Trey and Antonia are fun characters and although the reader my find themselves getting frustrated with Antonia at times (okay, okay I admit) she is still an endearing character that is well matched for our hero Trey.

It's amazing how most of the book's haters desperately try to defend the current system that is turning America into a falling empire. No, Frank does not talk down voters. The book's bashers misunderstand that Frank could care less about people's take on culture issues like guns and abortion. It's how both conservatives and liberals have used cultural populism to write off the economy. Frank pretty much pounds both sides for distracting voters with social and personal issues such as guns, abortion, patriotism, etc ... Of course, \\"conservatives\\" have won the culture war. Roe v Wade will never be overturned although Congress and the president along with most states have already made it irrelevant by creating barriers against women's rights to decide how to handle unwanted pregnancies. Instead, as has been the case with Bush's recent nominees, Roberts and Miers, it's all about allowing corrupt business practices to control America to the point of destruction. Frank's interviews with voters in the book have generally shown that most social conservative voters would still vote Democrat because they could count on them to protect their economic sanity. But year after year as Democrats voted lockstep with the GOP on tax cuts for the elite, \\"free trade\\", deregulation, etc ... social issues would control the way they vote for politicians. Thus, the voters' inclination to vote against their own economic interests has pervaded Kansas and continues to pervade much of America. There is one thing Frank never mentions in this book at least. Much of these same lower and middle class voters are hoodwinked by these same \\"conservatives\\" into believing that they too will be rich like the elitists as long as they vote \\"conservative\\". Trouble is these voters end up losing what's left for them to defend and in the process pushing themselves into the LOSING class or further into it. If the Democrats can't take bold initiatives and return to campaigning and legislating like economic populists, expect the \\"conservative\\" frauds to win office after office.	2005-10-10

But I thoroughly enjoyed this book, for the incredible journey that he and Charley Boorman took, but also because their personalities really shone through, giving you an honest sense of how their cross-continental experiences changed them. <br />The whole book is structured like one long conversation, one long storytelling yarn by the fireplace. So it came across as very personal, and a nice read overall. I did find the British slang a little distracting, if only because I had to pause for a moment to be certain that I could \\"translate it.\\"  <br />I enjoyed the pace for most of the book, though it did seem that at the point when the pair were truly exhausted, the book lost a little of its steam too. There was an evident struggle to get to their finish line, which isn't surprising. But you'll find that the book reads like that as well.	2005-10-10

At the age of 35, I find that 'dinging my back' gets easier. An episode is very predictable now... between 4 and 6 days to recover. I know the drill.  <br /> <br />About a year ago, my sister, who suffers from upper back pain, recommended this book. She said it changed her life. So I read the book from cover to cover and learned the exercises. In reality, they are all stretches. <br /> <br />A month after reading the book, I was shoveling some dirt in the back yard, and I got that all too familiar 'pop' in my lower back. Darn it... I immediately dropped to the ground and did the lower back stretches. The most amazing thing happened. The usual 5 day recovery cycle (and I know them well) simply did not happen. No pain but a little restriction in back movement. One day recovery, which is amazing. <br /> <br />So the book really helps me, and I completely recommend it. If you read all the reviews on this site, you will note some criticisms that the book does not address all types of back pain. Frankly, that is fair enough. The McKinsey Method targets problems with the spinal curvature (lolsarsis) of the lower and upper back. Luckily for me, those tend to be my problems, and they are fairly common problem areas.  <br /> <br />So is it a magic bullet? No. No reputable doctor will tell you there is any magic bullet for anything. Does it dramatically increase your odds of establishing some control over your lower and upper back pain? In my humble opinion, yes. Are the exercises mostly preventative in nature, and just really good ideas? In my humble opinion, absolutely.  <br /> <br />So if you are looking to establish some measure of control over your back pain, the book is worth a look. In my case, it was the best 10 dollars I ever spent, and has paid for itself many times. I used to see my chiropractor once or twice a month. Now I see him every four months for a maintenance adjustment. The difference is amazing.<br /> <br />Wishing you good health and a pain free back,   <br /> <br />Richard <br />	2005-10-10

Although Ringo writes pretty good SF and I picked this book up in the SF section - it's some kind of bizarro cross between a poor-man's Clancy and a BDSM porn book. Actually, it's three short stories, none of them particularly memorable. The first is a throwback to those old pulp Destroyer type books of the seventies, with a brooding hero who wipes out everything in his path. Problem is the hero is too good, so there really isn't any tension. Ringo has also let his politics get in the way here, so you get distracted by dumb conservative cliche'd thinking (I'm a conservative but not dumb). He also uses George W Bush as president and Donald Rumsfeld as Defence Secretary, though he changes their names. But President \\"Cliff\\" refers to his father's error in failing to turf out Sadaam in 91 so... The first story is also laughably unbelievable as it involves Osama Bin laden and the President of Syria conspiring to kidnap American Co-ed hotties, and then rape and torture them on the internet (!!) Nowhere does it say how they expect to profit from this except perhaps to upset those softy yanks. And frankly, if Bin Laden could get a dozen terrorists with their own airplane to America I think he'd find better things to do with them. This first story reads like it was written by a teenage boy with too many hormones, especially since the girls are naked the entire story. And several times, as they are rescued, their rescuers beg them not to hate all men and become, like, lesbos or something because of what the A-rabs did to them. (sheesh!) <br /> <br />The second story is even stranger. It features our hero, now rich since he got the reward for his earlier hero work, doing the beachbum boater thing in the Caribbean with a million dollar yacht. Our hero is into bondage, and quickly finds a pair of just out of high school girls who think he's the neatest thing since sliced bread. Now the bondage and sex is a little too detailed for a thrillerand not nearly detailed or graphic enough for erotica or porn (or even romances these days). And our hero's seduction of these teenagers reads like a classroom lecturer explaining the theory behind bdsm fetishism. He also makes sure they call someone to protect themselves before going off on his boat, warns them about taking drugs and drinks from strangers - and insists they call their moms, who, btw, are fine with their teen daughters getting into a bondage/slavery relationship in the Caribbean with a guy ten or fifteen years older than them they've never met (!!). Just so they're home by midnight, I guess. Towards the end of the story he dumps the girls to go kill a bunch more A-rabs. <br /> <br />The third story has him chasing a nuke through European cliches. The Russians are noble but corrupt. The French are largely stupid and arrogant. For no reason I can figure out the people who stole the bomb use a bus commonly used to transport slave girls to old Yugoslavia, which lets him go there to explore slavery, which he both loves and despises. He also gets to rather nastily beat and rape a teen prostitute identified as perhaps 15/17yo, which goes totally against his altruistic sexual restraint in the second story. Ringo seems to be trying to portray him as a tortured soul on the edge of being an evil character like those he hates, but he turns it on and off without any explanation or background and so it's completely unbelievable. <br /> <br />Ringo does pretty good SF, as I said earlier. I'm not sure what this is, but it's uhm, not so good. He's also falling into too many cliches. His characters, for example, duck-walk, crab-walk, leapord-walk...  Did Ringo browbeat his editors into letting this out? God knows Clancy's last few books have sucked big time, but I hadn't thought Ringo was succesful enough yet to bully his editors into letting dreck through. &lt;shrug> If you want a techno-thriller, there are plenty who are doing it better. If you want a soft porn bondage story there's lots on the internet. This is supposed to be book 1 of \\"Kildar\\" but I have no idea what Kildar might be. It's certainly not identified here and there are no issues to resolve I saw.	2005-10-10

The stories that provide living examples of that behavior are compelling and engaging.  The subtexts are equally engaging.  What is the nature of the bureaucracy which feeds on dysfunctionality but does not ameliorate it?  What is the nature of the political 'leadership' which ensures its own success and survival by perpetuating the dysfunctionality?<br /><br />I would love to see Dalrymple do a book in which he explores at length the clash between his Hobbesian take on human nature and the Rousseau/Marx-inspired view that is its contrary.  Why do utopian views persist in a world that has known the gulags and the holocaust?  Why do emotion-laden theories and policies persist in the face of recalcitrant realities?  To what degree are the 'debates' authentic and to what degree are they shams?  Does discredited theory persist in order to keep the 'underclass industry' in place?  How do we walk the line between permissive decadence on the one hand and authoritarian constraint on the other?  How do \\"reasonable people\\" (i.e. those who don't want a world of constant obscenity and irresponsibility on the one hand, nor a world in which we will be whipped for chewing gum on the other) play a greater role in this effort?  How do we give voice to those (are they a silent majority?) who neither desire a return to a bigoted and puritanical past nor a continuation of the crudity, violence, and ignorance of the present?	2005-10-10

Sounds simple enough.  <br /> <br />What happens is this:  He goes back to the South with the idea of attending the funeral and then doing his research on plantation homes and famous houses.  But when he visits the house where the housekeeper lived (before the funeral), something happens to him-he enters a room of the house and what he sees is so overpowering, so emotionally devastating, that he decides to explore his past, and in the process write articles about the houses he lived in or visited as a child.  As a result, myriad things come up for him, mentally and physically.  He begins to remember incidents-some good, some bad-and piece together his childhood or lack thereof.  The flashbacks get more and more intense, and a power struggle ensues with his boss over the \\"articles\\" which are now becoming short stories in the magazine he writes for.  But this power struggle about content and style aren't just between he and his boss; They're between himself and his dead father as the boss now represents all the things he (the main character) hated about that man.  The intertwining of past and present are remarkable, and by the time you get to the end and find out what was in the house of the African-American maid, you'll be blown away.  If you're not in tears over this scene, run, don't walk to the doctor, and have your pulse taken.   <br /> <br />As if this premise and skillful execution of complex ideas weren't enough, layer on top of this page-turner-story the fact that there are tie-ins to Helen Keller, Truman Capote, and even Charles Dickens (coincidences, form, Victorian-like length of the book, etc).  And if that still isn't enough, there are metaphors galore and a weaving through the text of people, places, and objects, all sure to leave your mind reeling.  There's a reason this book is taught in several universities (Middlebury) and high schools throughout the country. At least a host of English teachers recognize a great novel when they see it. <br /> <br />Suffice it to say that \\"Dogwood\\" is a masterpiece on many levels.  Unfortunately, in today's world, with its MTV short attention span and need for instant, shallow gratification, as one other reviewer said, \\"Few will actually get it.\\"   <br />	2005-10-10

One of the first autobiographical works in the modern sense, it also represents the first time a psychological and theological enterprise were combined. It also helps to bridge the gap between the Classical world and the Medieval world, exhibiting strong elements identifying with each of those major historical periods.<br /><br />Most undergraduates in the liberal arts encounter the book at some point; all seminarians do (or should!). Many adults find (or rediscover) the book later, after school. For many in these categories, there are concepts, narrative strands and historical data new and unusual for them. However, Augustine's 'Confessions' is still generally more accessible in many ways that truly classical pieces; it has interior description as well as external reporting that we are familiar with in modern writing.<br /><br />The 'Confessions' shows Augustine's personality well - he was a passionate person, but his focus wavered for much of his life until finally settling upon Christianity and the Neoplatonic synthesis with this faith. Even while remaining a passionate Christian and rejecting the sort of dualism present in the Manichee teachings, he varied between various positions within these systems. Augustine's varied thought reaches through many denominational and scholarly paradigms.<br /><br />The 'Confessions' are divided into thirteen chapters, termed 'Books' - the first ten of the books are autobiographical, with Augustine describing both events in his life as well as his philosophical and religious wanderings during the course of his life. The text is somewhat difficult to take at times, as this is writing with a purpose, as indeed most autobiographies are. The purpose here at times seems to be to paint Augustine in the worst possible light (the worse his condition, the better his conversion/salvation ends up being); at other times, one gets a sense (as one might get when reading the Pauline epistles) that there is some significant degree of ego at work here (Paul boasts of being among the better students, and so does Augustine, etc.).<br /><br />Augustine also uses his Confessions as a tract against the Manichean system - once a faithful adherent, Augustine later rejects the Manichean beliefs as heretical; however, one cannot get past the idea that Augustine retained certain of their intellectual aspects in his own constructions even while denouncing them in his official life story.<br /><br />The whole of the conversion turns on two primary books - Book Seven, his conversion to the Neoplatonic view of the world, including the metaphysics and the ethics that come along with this system; and Book 8, which describes his conversion to Christianity proper. This is where perhaps the most famous directive, 'Tolle! Lege!' ('Take and read!') comes from - Augustine heard a voice, and he picked up the nearest book, which happened to be a portion of the Pauline epistles, arguing against the undisciplined lifestyle Augustine lived. Scholars continue to debate whether Augustine's conversion to Christianity was more profound or more important than his conversion to Neoplatonism; in any event, Christianity interpreted through a Platonic framework became the norm for centuries, and remains a strong current within the Christian world view; Protestant reformers as they went back to the 'original bible' in distinction from the Catholic interpretations of the day also went back to the 'original Augustine' for much of their theology.<br /><br />The final three books are Augustine's dealing with the creation of the world via narrative stories in Genesis 1 exegetically and hermeneutically. This is very different from what is done in modern biblical scholarship, but is significant in many respects, not the least of which as it gives a model of the way Augustine dealt with biblical texts; given Augustine's towering presence over the development of Western Christianity in both Catholic and Protestant strands, understanding his methods and interpretative framework can lead to significant insights into the ideas of medieval and later church figures.<br /><br />The Loeb Library is one of the few editions where the reader can get a copy of this Latin text in the Latin language.  Widepread in English and other languages, actual Latin editions of this famous text are increasingly rare, and the Loeb Library has a consistency of quality of editions that makes this one well worth having.  This is a book that will be of interest to novice readers of Augustine as well as scholars, to students, clergy and laypersons, and anyone else who might have an historical, literary, philosophical, theological or other interest in Augustine - something for everyone, perhaps?of Western Christianity in both Catholic and Protestant strands, understanding his methods and interpretative framework can lead to significant insights into the ideas of medieval and later church figures.  <br /> <br />The Loeb Library is one of the few editions where the reader can get a copy of this Latin text in the Latin language.

US	52872836	R2H16DK4VBSYOX	0393307050	680723399	Master and Commander	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A Reading Adventure	This is the first of the series of books about the adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey of His Majesty's Royal Navy, and his friend Stephen Maturin, a Natural Philosopher (biologist) and ship's surgeon. The story opens in Port Mahon, a British possession in the Mediterranean Sea, at the dawn of the 19th century, when England stands virtually alone in the war against the forces of Napoleon. As the series begins, Lieutenant Jack Aubrey is given his promotion to Master & Commander, and placed in command of a sloop called the Sophie. In his festive mood and urge to celebrate, he encounters in the town a man with whom he had an unpleasant encounter the previous evening, a transient and apparently destitute physician named Stephen Maturin. He invites the near-stranger to celebrate with him. Thus is born an unlikely friendship of two widely disparate individuals that will last their whole lives.    Throughout the story, we learn quite a bit about the characters of Jack and Stephen. Jack is depicted as something of a buffoon on land, but a natural warrior at sea; an amalgamation of the greatest British naval heroes of the time. At times, there almost seem to be two Jack Aubreys: Jack on land, and Jack at sea. On land, Jack is somewhat blustery and full of his own station in life, someone who considers himself far more of an intellectual than he truly is. At sea, he is perfectly in his element, a brilliant tactician and gifted commander. Stephen embodies the spirit of scientific advancement of the time period. Half Irish, half Catalonian, an expatriate of both nations, one isn't sure if he's running from some darker past as he agrees to join Jack in sailing around the Mediterranean to places unknown. His reasons for being in Mahon are somewhat vague, but he claims to have nothing holding him to the area, and so agrees to join Jack in his new command.    But the truly brilliant work here is how O'Brian makes these characters come richly alive on the page. Apart from Jack and Stephen, a host of other characters are introduced to the reader, and we become immersed in the life of the Sophie at sea, learning most of the sailors by name. The characterization of each is unique, and several of them return over the course of the series. In this first volume, Jack forges bonds and finds himself in conflict with various members of those under his command and above him. Most notably he finds himself clashing with James Dillon, his firey Irish first lieutenant who has, unbeknownst to Jack, a history of subversive conflict against England itself.    The vocabulary in the book can be a bit difficult to follow if one is not familiar with Age of Sail terminology. I knew next to nothing about it; couldn't tell you the difference between a lateen and a halyard when I picked up the book, let alone the perils of a leeward shore. But some of these terms and concepts are introduced to the reader through Maturin, who is also totally ignorant of naval matters. As characters on the ship explain various aspects of naval life, the reader becomes familiar with it as well, and it becomes easier to follow as the book goes on. Much of the vocabulary can be figured out from context, or failing that, with the help of a good dictionary. We learn that the rank of Master & Commander is not a true captain, but called captain only by custom and courtesy. Jack's true ambition is to be promoted to Post Captain, the next rank up from where he is, and from there he has only to live long enough and he will become an admiral as those above him die off.    Jack and Stephen share the spotlight as the hero of the story, each for different reasons. Both are drawn in colorful detail, though much of Stephen remains a mystery still by the end of this book. Both are more fully fleshed out in the rest of the series, and become two of the most memorable and detailed characters in modern fiction.    O'Brian's fiction fits seamlessly into the real history of the time, with a few admitted changes made in the chronology of events, as well as the actual ships present in any particular engagement. A small 14-gun sloop-of-war, the fictional Sophie under Captain Aubrey becomes the terror of the Mediterranean, and garners her captain the nickname of \\"Lucky Jack Aubrey.\\" The prose is totally immersive, bringing the reader into the age through language taken directly from the Regency period. The action is brilliantly detailed, making one feel as if they are standing on the deck of the ship in the heat of battle, seeing everything that goes on in a ship-to-ship engagement.    The action is plentiful in this volume of the series, and at times it may seem too episodic. Some of the fights in the book aren't truly instrumental to the story, but there are relatively few of them described in that level of detail. O'Brian got most of his material directly from the records of the official naval archives, and created characters, events, and personal observations from letters and journals surviving from the times. A great deal of research went into these stories, and O'Brian brings them to life for the reader in vivid detail as if giving us a time machine to take us back in person.    A truly enjoyable book in its own right, Master & Commander begins a series that transports the reader back in time, to an age of \\"wooden ships and iron men.\\" Once begun, the series is hard to put down, but at 20 books (plus the unfinished 21st), it represents quite a commitment in one's reading schedule. But with the skill with which O'Brian creates his characters and stories, the books pass all too quickly, always leaving us hungry for more.	2005-10-10

This is a book written to hopefully bring long-overdue justice to many souls in the depths of torment and despair... <br />Toward the close of her book, Barbara raises issues of credibility and believability.  If one knew her, those questions would not even be relevant.  She is not an hysteric nor is she a histrionic woman - which is not to say that she is not passionate about \\"the issue\\" as we've come to call it - but one of scientific mind and method, asking the hard questions, demanding complete and honest answers whatever they may be and wherever they may lead, but above all she is not one to let herself be \\"shut down\\".   <br />Her years and years of trial by fire have been a quest for truth.  Surprisingly, she doesn't ask for \\"heads to roll\\".  It reads like a spy or mystery novel, but every once in awhile, one shakes his/her head and realizes the narrative is well-researched and hard-lived facts, and it's quintessential Barbara.   <br />Having had some of the nightmares she's experienced; having had her house, her supposed sanctuary, invaded; having been foiled in her many attempts to get at the truth; and having had many top level \\"brass\\" attempt to make her \\"crazy\\" or make her believe she was; that she didn't \\"go off her rocker\\" is astounding!  That she didn't \\"wig out\\" (as she puts it) is amazing, and a testimony to her belief and faith in her Almighty Father.   <br />I found myself using it much as one would a study guide, referring to the index to see how this or that person addressed this nation's most pressing issue - or ducked it - and I came away asking myself,  \\"How can a nation ask her sons - and now daughters - to go to distant lands far from loved ones to possibly die, or worse, be taken captive, with this in the back of one's mind: `If captured, I won't be found; no one will come to look for me; my family - my children - my wife - my parents - won't know that my thoughts are always turning to them, that I'm being betrayed by the very country thatI volunteered to serve.'\\"  <br />If Barbara's book will prevent even one family from suffering what her family has suffered, and are continuing to suffer, then, knowing her, she will feel that her years and her efforts have not been in vain.  This is not a Hollywood movie where the long-lost husband comes running toward her from out of the jungle, bedraggled, disoriented, but finally recognizing his devoted and long-suffering wife; would that it were... this is written to keep the plight of our sometimes unwilling servicemen in the forefront of our minds and hearts.   <br />There is another thing we Americans should remember: those same \\"sometimes unwilling\\" soldiers *did* go to Viet Nam; they *did not* take the path north to Canada; they *did* go when their country called them; they and their loved ones deserve more than to have them just swept away.  <br />Thanks, Barb; it's not nearly enough, but thank you, from the bottom of my heart.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

This book provided some great points for discussion about religion and survival but enough is enough. I felt that it was overly graphic and at times plain nauseatingly repetitive. I loved the character of Pi and the way that the author used vivid description and bold actions to really make him breathe, but I was very disappointed that his later life character was not more fully developed. The ending of this book is very disappointing. I wanted to know about the effect of the journey on Pi's life as an adult and the effects on his children. Making the audience question the validity of the entire story was not a good move. It distracts from the essential ideas of the book of faith and survival. I would recommend this book to others but with a bad taste in my mouth. It is a good solid read with a disappointing ending so be prepared.	2005-10-10

Dynamic characters pepper the pages and I dare you not to fall a little bit in love with Alex Romero, a true dark, handsome, and protective hero.<br /><br />Jasmine \\"Jazz\\" Adams has a twin that is investigating a story that requires her (Jazz) to pretend that she is her sister Jessica. The reason behind the twin switch... so no one at the news station knows that anything is wrong. Jessica wants to be on a network, and this story might just be her ticket to the big time. Well, Jazz has no idea that her sister has been receiving threatening letters and e-mail, and she also has no idea that her new boss has hired a bodyguard to protect her. Imagine her surprise when she goes to her sister condo and is jumped right at the door by said protector!<br /><br />Things are about to get a lot scarier though when things don't start adding up regarding her sister's disappearance. Instead of phone calls, she gets text messages, it looks as if her sister comes home but leaves no notes. This is not like Jessica and Jazz starts to worry. If this is not enough, she has to deal with the sexy Alex. He is causing a whole of emotional upheaval for her but at the same time he's keeping a distance between them that she doesn't understand. Is this mess going to turn out all right?<br /><br />Alex has been told that he has to keep his principle safe and he can't touch her. Not a problem until he gets a good look at her. Than he finds out that Jess is actually Jazz and the one person he must keep safe is MIA. The search for Jess though leads to places that they can't even believe. It appears that she has participated in an adult video, but Jazz swears that her sister would never do that. The new boss seems to have deep feelings for Jess, but Jazz swears that she would never sleep to get to the top. Things are not adding up and the longer she's missing the more trouble it means.

It may be several years old, but it was new to me.  <br /> <br />With a piercing wit and a sharp tongue, Cintra Wilson cuts down to size some of Hollywood's biggest celebrities. The result is both funny and sad at the same time. Funny, because it's always entertaining to see the rich and famous make fools of themselves in the pursuit of even greater fame, power and money.  <br /> <br />And sad, because it's pathetic to see the extent to which some of these people are willing to debase themselves in order to maintain their status once they become rich and famous, especially those that have questionable talent to begin with. Even sadder is the fact that masses of people all over the world idolize them.  <br /> <br />With their self-indulgent behavior often disguised from the public or cloaked under a veil of piousness (i.e, Ethan Hawke, Tom Hanks) Wilson reveals how some of liberal Hollywood's biggest names are about as morally bankrupt as the staunchest right-wing conservative.  <br /> <br />What makes this book carry even more weight with me is the fact that it was written by someone who describes herself as being \\"about as liberal as they come\\". But Wilson's commentary is far and above the type of one-sided and one-dimensional whining about Hollywood and the \\"media elite\\" one gets from the likes of Rush Limbaugh, Bill Bennett, and other purveyors of right-wing bile.  <br /> <br />[Aside: I once saw Bill Bennett walking in downtown Washington, DC; the man's belly was the size of three pregnant women combined. I mean, it was just enormous; someone needs to tell him that gluttony is no virtue (and neither is gambling, for that matter...he he :-)].  <br /> <br />But back to my review...  <br /> <br />In a few cases, Wilson details specific incidents of outrageous or attention-seeking behavior on the part of certain celebrities, identifying the person by name - Barbara Streisand, Keeanu Reeves, Cher, Courtney Love, CelineDion, Michael Jackson (Dion and Jackson receive a particularly delicious skewering).  <br /> <br />But in other instances, she refers to \\"a celebrity who shall remain nameless\\". For example, I would love to know the name of the ogre who for no reason at all drew a gun and shot someone's watch. I wondered why some of them were named while others not. (Threat of lawsuits would be my guess).  <br /> <br />Predictably, some of the celebrities' bad behavior involves sexual improprieties. In fact, the book is filled with accounts of people who have literally prostituted themselves for fame.  <br /> <br />My one (and very slight) criticism of \\"A Massive Swelling\\" has to do with Wilson's writing style, which can only be described as idiosyncratic. She has a tendency to write in run-on sentences, which require several re-readings to understand. However, this is a small complaint and it in no way diminishes the value--and timeliness--of this hilariously entertaining book. <br />	2005-10-10

Jones, professor of philosophy in California. This series is a very strong, thorough introduction to the course of Western Philosophy, beginning at the dawn of the philosophical enterprise with the pre-Socratics in ancient Greece to the modern thinkers such as Wittgenstein and Sartre. It has grown, over the three decades or so of its publication, from one to four then to five volumes. It has remained a popular text, and could serve as the basis of a one-year survey of philosophy for undergraduates or a one-semester survey for graduate students. Even advanced students in philosophy will find this valuable, all major topics and most minor topics in the course of philosophy are covered in these volumes.<br /><br />Jones states that there are two possible ways for a writer to organise a history of philosophy -- either by addressing everyone who ever participated in philosophy (which could become rather cumbersome if one accepts the premise that anyone could be a philosopher), or to address the major topics and currents of thought, drawing in the key figures who address them, but leaving out the lesser thinkers for students to pursue on their own. Jones has chosen the latter tactic, making sure to provide bibliographic information for this task.<br /><br />This volume, 'The Twentieth Century to Wittgenstein and Sartre', starts where the last volume leaves off, as philosophy enters the turbulent twentieth century. The first major philosophical school Jones looks at is the idea of Process philosophy, which tends to take a nod from science and modern ideas of how we know things, and a realistic idea of what we do not, and perhaps cannot, know. Process philosophy often tends to get ignored now, save in theological circles, where the work of Whitehead have been taken on board.<br /><br />Other philosophers covered in this volume on the twentieth century include Dewey, Bergson, Moore, Frege, Russell, Husserl, Heidegger, Sartre, and Wittgenstein. One of the primary fields of philosophy is epistemology -- how we know what we know, and do we know anything? All major philosophers have dealt with this, as metaphysics tended to take a back seat, and fields such as politics, ethics, and religion retreated to the background, at least as far as philosophy is concerned (the fields of political theory, etc., gained much ground in the twentieth century as separate from philosophy).<br /><br />Wittgenstein is the point at which Jones opted to end the series, as it becomes difficult, from an historical standpoint, to decide what of the past few decades should be incorporated. Philosophy is a slow-moving enterprise, and the 'hot' publications and thinkers today may fade quickly tomorrow, so predicting who will stand the test of time is difficult. Wittgenstein is also an appropriate philosopher to end with, given that when he wrote his magnum opus, the Tractatus, he thought he had finally resolved all major philosophical problems; reflecting later in life, he realised he was not correct, and this in and of itself may represent the embodiment of the philosophical project.<br /><br />However, Jones later thought better of this ending, given the decades that passed since the original publication. There is a difficulty with recommending this text, in that there is yet another revision to the series, and that lies in this volume. There is another version that goes beyond Jones' earlier decision to end with Wittgenstein, including the works of Derrida and more recent modern thinkers. Either volume, from the standpoing of history, will serve the reader well, and while this volume gets five stars for its quality, perhaps the reader collecting the volumes today should opt for the yet-again-revised volume of philosophy to Quine and Derrida.<br /><br />Each volume ends with a glossary of terms, and a worthwhile index. The glossary warns against short, dictionary-style definitions and answers to broad terms and questions, and thus indicates the pages index-style to the discussion within the text for further context. The one wish I would have would be a comprehesive glossary and index that covers the several volumes; as it is, each volume has only its own referents.<br /><br />This is minor criticism in a generally exceptional series. It is not easy text, but it is not needlessly difficult. The print size on the direct quotes, which are sometimes lengthy, can be a strain at times, but the reading is worthwhile.ry-style definitions and answers to broad terms and questions, and thus indicates the pages index-style to the discussion within the text for further context.

This is a beautifully and honestly crafted story of one immigrant experience.  The days of Maddalena's life are spent working as a seamstress, evenings she cooks for the males in her husband's large family, and her nights are spent waiting for her husband to come to her and praying that she will finally succeed in producing a child.   <br /> <br />Although so many sacrificed so much to come to this mixed society, the Italians lived in a neighborhood with other Italians, and resented (perhaps unto death) any influx of outsiders.  This book bravely raises problems that had no resolution - at least none in the fifties - problems of life and race in a sea of work and fear, of striving for monetary success, and of loneliness. Maddalena is finally able to make a friend, a man named Julian. He is like a gift, as he brings Maddalena music from her lost society, and although he is male, he is of a type apparently unworthy of her husband's jealousy.  It strikes me now - as I write this - that Julian is the only man in the book that I would care to share an espresso with, although meeting all of them has been most interesting.  The characters represent a culture that was the European immigrant experience - and Mr. Castellani has shown us a slice of it.  Well done! <br />	2005-10-10

US	53015768	R3JK7TVNZDNRH2	0802150373	62415828	Murphy	Books	5	28	28	N	N	Comic-tragic masterpiece	Murphy is a novel unlike any other. Quite deliberately, Beckett's characters are not portrayed with realistic fullness, and the plot is fragmented and incomplete. Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable read if conventional expectations are suspended. Beckett's early work is often compared to Joyce, but they are actually very different. Beckett's works are essentially tragic-comic. There is one passage that perfectly encapsulates the problem of desire:<br /><br />\\"I greatly fear,\\" said Wylie, \\"that the syndrome known as life is too diffuse to admit of palliation. For every symptom that is eased, another is made worse. The horse leech's daughter is a closed system. Her quantum of wantum cannot vary.\\"<br /><br />Beckett considered this passage important enough to repeat twice in his novel. Murphy, the protagonist of this novel, realizes in effect that desire can never be satisfied, and so he simply withdraws from life, attempting to reach a state of catatonic stupor. His girlfriend tries with tragic pathos to draw him back into life, but her attempts are doomed to failure. Murphy's friends are all similar to himself, fragmented and incomplete. The novel's vision is absurdist, tragic, and existentialist--humans are \\"windowless monads,\\" doomed to isolation and misunderstanding. Beckett's achievement consists primarily in the brilliantly original language used to communicate his vision.

If you have not read InkHeart, don't. Don't read Inkspell either. Find a good author, like Mercedes Lackey or Tamora Pierce, and avoid Cornelia Funke's work entirely.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />A)Predictable unpredictability:I would follow the clues for a few pages, draw a conclusion about what would happen next, and then be disappointed again and again by the banal occurences that filled the book instead.<br /><br />B) Not a page turner: It went on, and on, and on, and everytime I thought it was over, I glanced at the remaining 400 or 200 pages wondering what in the world she was going to use as filler for the rest of the book. I am a fast reader, known to devour 15 or more books in a weekend, and it took me several days to drag myself through this book.<br /><br />C) Repetition, Repetition: The plot seems to circle around the same setting and even the same actions, never venturing far from the same events. This is embarassingly boring, especially since many readers already sat through hundreds of pages of the same in Inkheart.<br /><br />D) Weak Characters: The villains are not all that believable as villains, and the protagonists, while sympathetic, are even more two-dimensional than they were in Inkheart.<br /><br />There are a few good things about the book:<br /><br />The premise of Inkheart and Inkspell, that some people have the ability to call out characters from books by reading aloud, is suitably wonderful. How great it might be to have that talent--to call out Bilbo or Willy Wonka or Aladdin, but what if you couldn't then return them to their homes--how tragic and cruel for them.<br /><br />Or even worse, if you couldn't control the talent at all, so reading aloud Lord of the Rings might mean you'd get to talk to a hobbit or an elf, but might also mean you'd be facing a troll or an orc or Sauron himself.<br /><br />Funke adds onto these issues yet another layer, what if whatever was called up from the book didn't simply appear but had to replace someone else in your world so that your best friend or father or mother got sent into the book world?<br /><br />All of this is great fodder for a novel, or even a series, opening up limitless characters.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Inkspell, like Inkheart before it, falls short in the execution.r, what if whatever was called up from the book didn't simply appear but had to replace someone else in your world so that your best friend or father or mother got sent into the book world?  <br />All of this is great fodder for a novel, or even a series, opening up limitless characters.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Inkspell, like Inkheart before it, falls short in the execution.  <br />	2005-10-10

This is not an easy read and can hardly be called entertainment. Intended to be biographical, it takes a reader down a number of avenues. For instance, after a foreword by author Loretta Napoleoni, a section on Iranian politics and the mullahs, another on terrorism and Islam, a third on Iranian culture and a letter to Omid's readers, we almost begin at the beginning. <br /> <br />     From that point, we cover her difficult childhood, family problems, life with Jewish friends, politics, the Islamic Revolution, her hellish high school years, higher education, reaching young womanhood and surviving eight years of war with Iraq. <br /> <br />     She writes about the mobs paid to demonstrate in the streets and the women who roam the cities, looking for women or girls who have committed the slightest breach in the oppressive rules set forth by the mullah. Abducted by the secret police when campaigning for women's rights, Omid escapes by jumping from a moving car and eventually ends up in Canada. <br /> <br />     Reading this saga is worth the effort, if just for the author's insights into Iranian and Islamic culture and the lunatic fringe that has taken charge of her native land. <br /> <br />__Budd Arthur <br />	2005-10-10

This extensive work examines Joyce's life from his birth to his death.  Ellmann's narrative derives from Joyce's letters as well as accounts from Joyce's brother, Stanislaus.  The book is most revealing in offering an understanding of the process it took for Joyce to come up with his most monumental works, ULYSSES AND FINNEGANS WAKE.  Ellmann states that Joyce intentionally made it difficult for anyone to understand what he wrote.  He wanted to keep his critics, academics and scholars, guessing of what significance his nonsensical gibberish creation represented. In addition, Ellmann intertwines events that occurred in Joyce's life that show how they closely resemble the characters in the works he produced, such as his early work, A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN.<br /><br />James Joyce most likely can be considered a \\"starving artist.\\"  He would go without a new pair of shoes until they wore down to the soles, but looked debonair and sophisticated with non-matching suits.  In the beginning, he aspired to be a work within the realms of Jesuit studies, but later opted for a writing career that would take him from Trieste, Paris, and Zurich. Joyce struggled with poverty through out his life even as his most famous works were published.  Monetary problems and health conditions that affected his eyesight never hindered his creative process.  If he lost his eyesight, he probably would have continued to write blind.  Joyce appeared to be an eccentric and stubborn man.  However, Ellmann shows a caring and supporting man who loved his wife and children, and most of all, his father, John Stanislaus Joyce.<br /><br />In terms to history and literature, Ellmann constantly references Joyce's fascination with Shakespeare, ancient civilization and history.  This is best displayed in ULYSSES, but one significant footnote is that he did not appear to care for American history.  He makes a minute reference to Ulysses S. Grant in ULYSSES, but he did not even know who the man was; Joyce loathed the United States.  Also, Ellmann offers a birds-eye view of what his cohorts thought of his work.  Gertrude Stein as well as Ernest Hemingway praised and envied Joyce's contributions to Modernism.<br /><br />Ellmann examines a tremendous amount of information within his narrative.  When one completes JAMES JOYCE, what else do you need to know about this genuine writer who used his craft as a means of getting back home, but never quite made it there?  But he preferred Zurich and its snow-capped mountains as home rather than the complexities of his former Dublin.  JAMES JOYCE is the springboard one needs when beginning a study of Joyce the man and his works, which should begin with PORTRAIT and ending with WAKE.rican history.

I wasn't expecting to feel as close to the heroine as I did. Nor was I expecting to love the story as much as I did.  <br /> Bella is shy and smart and very sweet. She is in an awkward place at the beginning of the novel. Her mother recently got remarried and Bella has decided to go and live with her father for awhile so that her mom and new step father have time to spend together. Her father lives in a rainy gloomy place that Bella has a very hard time acclimating to, since she has spent most of her life in Phoenix. <br />She starts a new school and meets an interesting variety of people. Amazingly enough she makes a few friends her first day. There at the new school is where she first spots Edward Cullen. He and his brothers and sisters are by far the most beautiful kids at school. They are also the most aloof and isolated. Bella is immediately intimidated and fascinated at the same time.  She finds that she has a class with Edward and thus begins their rather tumultuous and intense relationship. Edward misses a lot of school, she never sees him on a day where there are no clouds, and she never sees him eat. All of these things make her curious and eventually he is forced to share his secret and to admit how much she means to him.  <br />This is a very sweet book. I would say almost perfect for teenagers. Edward loves Bella with a very pure love. He is aware at all times that he could harm her without really even trying. His restraint and pain at holding back his affection for her is very real. Her determination to be a part of his life and to accept his darkness, no matter what, is equally inspiring. This is definitely a book that I will recommend at the bookstore I work. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Prof. Lisa Randall's new book, Warped Passages, is a grand tour of some of the most important recent developments in high-energy physics.<br /><br />The book is intended for a popular audience, but is also a very interesting read for anybody with a background in theoretical physics (like myself). The first part contains an overview of modern physics - Einstein's theories of relativity, quantum mechanics and the Standard Model of particle physics. The last part concentrates on the idea of extra dimensions beyond the standard four we know about, which can be motivated by string theory and its discovery of the so-called D-branes. Specifically, she explains the work, pioneered by herself, Raman Sundrum and others, on the so-called \\"braneworld scenarios\\". Basically, this is the idea that our four dimensional space-time is embedded in some higher dimensional space, usually called the \\"bulk\\".<br /><br />You might think, that extra dimensions are just part of a set of crazy ideas? On the contrary. You should know, that the idea of extra dimensions is actually not at all new. Already in 1884, the original book, \\"Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions\\" (written by the English mathematician Edwin Abbott) described a world of two-dimensional beings, who only have indirect knowledge of the extra third space-dimension. But, from a mathematical point of view, one can imagine as many dimensions as one wants to. In physics, the story is somewhat different.<br /><br />In physics, there are basically two distinct ways in which one can add extra dimensions to our four-dimensional universe. Already in the 1920's, Klein suggested that our universe is five-dimensional, where the extra dimension is rolled up in a circle, which is so tiny, that the universe looks four-dimensional at long enough distance-scales. The motivation was to give a unified geometrical description of electromagnetism and gravitation using Einstein's general theory of relativity.  However appealing, this theory was destined to fail. Today we know, that there are other forces which should be included in a unified theory: namely the weak and strong nuclear forces. Presently there is only one theory which can possibly do the work, and this is string theory. Perturbative string theory tells us, that our space-time is ten-dimensional, and that the extra six dimensions should be rolled up in a small but complicated shape (which is determined by some mathematical restrictions).<br /><br />Another way to achieve hidden extra dimensions of space is to suppose, that all normal matter, as well as the light by which we see the world, is confined to a four-dimensional \\"brane\\" embedded in a five-dimensional \\"bulk\\" - or larger universe. These so-called braneworld theories are the ones of Lisa Randall, Raman Sundrum and others. Warped Passages explains - in excellent style - the logic behind these seemingly fancy ideas.<br /><br />What I particularly liked about the first part of this book is how Prof. Randall makes people envision extra dimensions. As Randall writes, \\"we are not physiologically equipped to envision more than three dimensions of space\\", so it might be difficult for the general reader to comprehend this idea. But, as Prof. Randall also explains, readers need not imagine a dimension only in spatial terms. Here is an example from the book: If you are buying a house, the factors you might consider include its location (specified by three numbers), price (one number), size (one number), and possibly many other things. So, the number of dimensions in your house search simply equals \\"the number of quantities you find worth investigating\\".<br /><br />What Prof. Randall describes in the last part is - in more technical terms - her work with Raman Sundrum on solving the flavor-changing problem, the gaugino mass problem (and other things) that occur in supersymmetric models with the supersymmetry breaking sector on another brane, separated from ours, or in the bulk; the Randall-Sundrum warped geometry with two branes (a so-called \\"weak-brane\\", where we are supposed to live, and a \\"gravity-brane\\") and the Randall-Sundrum warped geometry with an infinite extra dimension, using so-called AdS geometry.<br /><br />The main point guiding Randall's research - described in the last part of the book - is the fact that gravity is such a profoundly weak force. Indeed, gravity is the puniest of the fundamental forces governing the matter in the universe, by a huge margin (typically a 10^36 times weaker than the electromagnetic force between two charged particles). Why is this so?<br /><br />Why this is so, Prof. Randall suggests, is because we live in a universe containing at least one extra dimension beyond those we can perceive. And gravity is weak because it has been \\"diluted\\" into this extra space. This is indeed a very simple and persuasive idea. (And also from the point of view of string theory a very compelling idea, with a simple explanation, related to objects in string theory called D-branes - like an infinite string (a 1-brane), a membrane (a 2-brane) etc). But note that Prof. Randall's original models are not inherently string-theoretical; it is just that her models have an elegant and simple interpretation in string theory. So you don't need to know *anything* about string theory to understand this book).<br /><br />The breakthrough research by Randall and Sundrum proposed that gravity's dilution can be explained in terms of a cosmic configuration featuring two branes - or two infinite planes, separated by a higher dimensional bulk space. Roughly speaking, the \\"center of gravity\\" is on the \\"gravity-brane\\" - and some gravity leaks out of this brane, through the bulk, and onto the other brane, usually called the \\"weak-brane\\", which is where we live, and which contain the Standard Model fields. Later on, Randall and Sundrum found, that their concept is also theoretically consistent with a configuration which includes only one brane. Usually, one would think that Newton's 1/r^2 law of gravitation implies that there are four and only four non-compact dimensions of infinite extend. Randall and Sundrum showed that this is not correct.<br /><br />The fact that branes are an important part of modern string theory meant that string theorists took an early interest in the Randall-Sundrum models. Furthermore, since Prof. Randall's research did not directly challenge string theory models, the string theory community actually accepted and recognized the profound significance of her work very early on.<br /><br />One of the long outstanding problems of the Standard Model of particle physics, that braneworlds do provide an interesting answer for, is the \\"hierarchy problem\\", or why the weak and Planck scales are so disparate (10^2 GeV compared with 10^19 GeV). In these scenarios, the fundamental gravitational scale is not the Planck scale, but something closer to the weak scale. The conjecture is that gravity is not weak because the Planck scale is so large, but because braneworlds provide various geometrical mechanisms for making the gravitational force much weaker than the others.<br /><br />All this would of course be pointless speculation unless there was some way for the extra dimensions to manifest themselves. So, can these ideas be experimentally tested? As Prof. Randall explains in detail, the answer is: yes indeed! It is possible that evidence supporting the braneworld models could appear within a decade or so, after the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), currently being built at the particle-physics laboratory CERN, starts operating in 2007. Here the traces of extra dimensions could come from \\"gravitons\\" (the fundamental constituents of gravity) moving into the extra dimension(s).<br /><br />Some versions of the theory even predict that, as a result, small black holes could conceivably be created from the high-speed collisions at the LHC! (but don't worry, the black holes will only exist for about 10^{-26} sec and the Earth will not dis&aacute;ppear into a black hole). If the LHC sees the kinds of effects predicted by these models, be sure that there will be some well-earned Nobel prizes for the people involved in this story.<br /><br />Let me say a few words about the style of the book. The book's central point - the possible existence of extra dimensions in space - is easy enough to explain; at least if the reader can comprehend the idea, that our universe has more than four space-time dimensions, which might not be easy. However, to motivate the conjecture of higher dimensions, Prof. Randall must first explain the General Theory of Relativity, quantum mechanics and the Standard Model of particle physics, with its zoo of subatomic objects - quarks, leptons, bosons of various sorts - and the details of the forces that act between them. To ensure the convergence of her ideas in the readers mind, she then has to go into more advanced topics such as \\"quantum field theory\\", \\"spontaneous symmetry breaking\\", the \\"Higgs potentials\\" and \\"supersymmetry\\". (But all these concepts are explained in much detail).<br /><br />All this is a prerequisite for being able to properly describe string theory, and Prof. Randall must then proceed to the less understood generalization called 'M-theory' (which is an eleven-dimensional theory containing two-branes and five-branes). Only then can Prof. Randall explain how branes emerge from a jumble of concepts and ideas, that most likely might be unfamiliar to the general reader. But as far as I can judge, she accomplish this tour de force with *much* success. The immanent \\"problem\\" with such theories of unification is that one cannot leave anything out and therefore - to be explained and understood - they require background knowledge in virtually all of physics. But I think that Prof. Randall has done a very good job in explaining all the required physics in terms of analogies, simple illustrations and so on.<br /><br />Finally I would like to stress that this book is *very* different from many of the random popular books about physics because Lisa Randall actually knows what she is talking about  And you should know, that Prof. Randall is not by any standards a random person: she has become the most cited high-energy physicist since 1999.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'll give Warped Passages some more than well-deserved 5 stars..

There is one central theme, domestic violence against a man but the love stories of both Steven and Julie, then Steven and Fallon are complex and show a brilliance not seen from many writers. In order to accomplish this, the writer had to manage feelings many of us are rarely willing to share with even our closest friends. In spite of her seemingly strange behaviors, Julie was deeply in love with Steven and he in love with her; unfortunately, neither seemed equipped to deal with the other. Steven and Fallon seemed more compatible because Fallon was a different and less aggressive personality type. The issue of abused men is something that needs to be discussed more openly, but I fear that there are too many people that have pre-conceived notions about the abused male that cause these men to refuse to come forward. Overall, I give this book two thumbs up, a 10 and an alrighty then!	2005-10-10

US	52480166	R2D8E19VO4F3Z5	1400054788	104226273	The Probability of God: A Simple Calculation That Proves the Ultimate Truth	Books	4	26	29	N	Y	Interesting probabilistic approach to the existence of God	There are many books that purport to prove the existence of God, or prove the non-existence of God.  This is a book that purports to calculate the probability of God existing. <br /> <br />More accurately, it formulates the existence of God as something that we may not be entirely certain of, and therefore depends on vague estimates of probabilities, which are subjective measures of one's predilections to believe arguments of one type or another.  Thus, this book acknowledges the subjective character of the question, and instead of focusing too much on the AUTHOR'S probability of the existence of God, it provides the reader with the tools to calculate the READER'S probabiliity of the existence of God. <br /> <br />This is a perfect example of a situation where the usual notion of probability often taught (when you flip the coin a thousand times it comes up heads as often as it comes up tails, for instance) comes up short.  This notion makes no sense when it comes to matters of fact, which cannot be repeated in experiment.  For this, Unwin describes the Bayesian interpretation of probability, pioneered in the early 1900s, where probabilities measure rational belief. <br /> <br />Unwin's work here applies the Bayesian notion of probability to five classical arguments used in the debate over the existence of God.  As such, he has added something new and interesting to the debate. <br /> <br />In execution, however, there are problems and fallacious arguments--a feature that can be beneficial in a classroom where these deficiencies can be debated and discussed.  First, Unwin's choice of five arguments determines the resulting probability more than he would like to admit.   If some arguments had been subdivided into subarguments, the probability would change, giving that argument more weight.  Similarly, there are fairly abstract philosophical arguments that were not brought in at all, which may be good for most people who are suspicious of such abstract arguments (perhaps with good reason) but it is important to recognize that not all arguments for or against the existence of God are considered. <br /> <br />Furthermore, the most difficult issue of all problems with the bayesian approach to probability, the initial a priori probability, he skips over facilely by declaring it to be 1/2.  This may perhaps be better defended than any other number, but the explanation here is lacking. <br /> <br />Unwin also has a rating system to deal with the effect of each evidence area on the overall probability of the existence of God, that is very coarse, as it must be in such situations (can you imagine anyone arguing that the existence of evil in the world, given that God exists, is 23% as opposed to 24%, for instance?)  The representative percent probabilities (1/11, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 10/11) he gets is fairly influential over the resulting answer, more than Unwin would like to admit.  He certanly doesn't get two decimal places of accuracy, as he claims. <br /> <br />Now there is structure to bayesian analysis that Unwin does not discuss.  In a chain of evidence, evidence that favors a hypothesis cancels evidence that works against that hypothesis in a very precise way, so that given his choices of probabilities, he is bound to get fairly moderate numbers (especially since he made sure to have arguments that favor the existence of God and arguments against). <br /> <br />Now, beyond the math, I should also mention a few other criticisms: <br />1.  Philosophers and theologians have brought a great deal of nuance to these arguments that Unwin does not acknowledge.  To take one example, the problem of evil in the world is not necessarily stacked against a traditional theist as it at first appears, depending on to what extent you accept various explanations offered by theists. <br />2.  As in any philosophical work, there are arguments Unwin makes that would not work for everyone.  For instance, his use of the anthropic principle to explain the fruitfulness of our universe depends on the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, which from a scientific methodological viewpoint, is as metaphysical and unmotivated as the existence of God in the first place.  Still, the fact that Unwin does not focus on the ANSWER but on the PROCESS the reader can use to find his or her own answer, ameliorates this consideration considerably, as long as the reader goes through this exercise. <br />3.  Unwin compares two positions: the traditional monotheist position of the Abrahamic faiths against the materialistic version of modern atheism.  Comparing many positions at once would make this story much more complicated, so it's easy to see why he didn't bother.  But for many people, the competing theories are of a different kind. <br />5.  The most compelling reasons for belief, for many people, often involve issues beyond rationality, such as personal encounters with the divine, or the influence of a community of belief.  And it is not at all clear that these reasons are \\"bad\\" reasons that should be shunned in these considerations.  But they are excluded from the start in Unwin's work. <br /> <br />Still, the fact that Unwin seeks to provide tools, not answer questions, makes this book valuable as a *beginning* of a conversation. <br /> <br />His description of faith as the extra-rational piece that goes beyond reason falls short of traditional understandings of faith.  Faith is not the magical extra extent to which one believes something that one would not believe otherwise.  It is a trust that one chooses to make when reason is there: \\"faith is a leap into the light, not a leap into darkness\\".  Even if this were the case, it is hardly acceptable to posit faith and rationality as adding together--as if a particularly gullible individual who has very good reason to believe something could end up with a probability of higher than 100%!  Yet this is the model he argues for, somewhat unconvincingly. <br /> <br />With all thesedisagreements aside, I recommend the book, not as a source of answers, but a way to start thinking about these questions for yourself, perhaps leading you to write another book that reflects your perspective on this question.  After reading this book, I was upset at the problems I mentioned above, but decided to organize a group of students to read this together, not in spite of the problems, but perhaps because of them.  It is a positive thing for discussions to be deeper, especially when one does not agree with the other side. <br /> <br />Beyond all of this, Unwin is a very clear writer, and explains concepts of probability, risk, and Bayesian analysis so that anyone can understand it.  He is also chatty and pleasant to read, with a sense of dry wit that can be delightful or annoying, depending on your personal taste in humor. <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend this book highly, as a beginning, not an end, to discussion.	2005-10-10
US	50974218	R2TJSQ585KXERW	0375810714	229403046	The Little Train	Books	5	38	39	N	N	Five stars for hardcover; four stars for board book.	This review covers both the board book (ISBN 037582264X; 32 pp.; c. 2002) and hardcover (ISBN 0375810714; 56 pp.; c. 2000) editions of *The Little Train* by Lois Lenski. <br /> <br />*The Little Train* was originally published in 1940 and hails approximately from the same era as Awdry's \\"Railway Series\\" (known to most children today as Thomas the Tank Engine stories).  The level of detail in the original picture book will please the most ardent of youthful train fans:  from the parts of the steam engine, to the coal hopper and water tower, to the roundhouse and turntable, to the semaphores (signals) and siding, etc.  By today's standards, the illustrations may seem old-fashioned, but there is a certain charm to the depiction of the countryside and railway scenes that isn't found in today's train picture books.  The story focuses on a steam engine's journey from Tinytown to \\"the city,\\" led by Engineer Small, Conductor Little, and Fireman Shorty.  The text is lengthy and prosy in comparison to today's picture books, and is probably best suited to 4 year-olds and older (or very attentive and train-obsessed 3 year-olds).  However, my 25 month-old train freak will happily sit through the story at least once, but that's probably because he's the spawn of two librarians. <br /> <br />The board book is an abridged version of the original hardcover, and is only 32 pages in length (compared to the original 56 pages).  About a third of the illustrations are omitted, and others are cropped.  The colors are a bit different from the 2000 reissue--for example, the passenger cars are more of a reddish hue (like the 1 train on the NYC subway), rather than orange brown.  Engineer Small is still the main character, but Conductor Little and Fireman Shorty are not even mentioned, although they do appear in the abbreviated story (it's actually Conductor Little who checks his watch, not Engineer Small).  Most of the details about the steam engine and railway are summarized or omitted altogether, which was disappointing to my 25 month-old son.  He was accustomed to the longer version that we'd borrowed from the library.  This simplified board book version is suitable for 1-3 year-olds, and the youngest of railfans who want to graduate from Donald Crews' *Freight Train* or Byron Barton's  *Trains*. <br /> <br />Five stars for the original version, and four stars for the board book edition. <br /> <br />As the tagline goes, \\"And that's all--about Engineer Small\\"!	2005-10-10

Rene Descartes is often considered the founding father of modern philosophy. A true Renaissance man, he studied Scholastic philosophy and physics as a student, spent time as a volunteer soldier and traveler throughout Europe, studied mathematics, appreciated the arts, and became a noted correspondent with royals and intellectual figures throughout the continent. He died in Sweden while on assignment as tutor to the Queen, Christiana.<br /><br />Descartes 'Discourse on Method' is a fascinating text, combining the newly-invented form of essay (Descartes was familiar with the Essays of Montaigne) with the same kind of autobiographical impulse that underpins Augustine's Confessions. Descartes writes about his own form of mystical experience, seeing this as almost a kind of revelation that all past knowledge would be superseded, and all problems would eventually be solved by human intellect.<br /><br />In the Discourse, Descartes formulates logical principles based on reason (which makes it somewhat ironic that this came to him almost as a revelation). Descartes had some appreciation for thinkers such as Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes, but he thought that Bacon depended too much upon empirical data, and with Hobbes he disagreed on what would be the criteria for ascertaining certainty.<br /><br />Descartes was a mathematician at heart, and perhaps had a carry-over of Pythagorean mystical attachment to mathematics, for his sense of reason led him to impute an absolute quality to mathematics; this has major implications for metaphysics and epistemology. Descartes method was a continuation in many ways of the ideas of Plato, Aristotle and the medieval thinkers, for they all tended toward thinking in absolute, universal terms in some degree.<br /><br />Descartes in his first section discounts much of Scholasticism, stating that the only real absolutes are theology and mathematics; because theology is based upon revelation, it is therefore beyond reason, and thus, mathematics becomes the only rational truth. Descartes develops this idea further with rules of method, which include ideas of intuition, analysis and deduction. He uses some of his method to come up with his greatest proposition:<br /><br />Cogito ergo sum - - I think, therefore I am<br /><br />'The Cogito is a first principle from which Descartes will now deduce all that follows.' This permits Descartes to deal both with rational elements and empirical data.<br /><br />The other major piece in this collection, 'The Meditations', includes several different mediations, including that on the existence of the soul, the existence of God, the material world, things we may doubt, and other philosophical problems of the time. These meditations do incorporate Descartes attempt to employ his method to some degree, but at the same time divert into other means. For example, Descartes' meditation on the existence of God is in many ways the Anselm ontological proof revisited, and has a certain circular reasoning to it.<br /><br />This is an important text, one that I read the summer before I went to college, and makes a good study for those who wish to see the personal element in the development of philosophy.mathematics becomes the only rational truth.

In fact, after finishing his so called \\"Urban Trilogy\\" I swore that I would never pick up another book of his, finding the greater part of his work trite, sophomoric, hackneyed, poorly written, and peopled with characters that just never came to life (this includes McMurtry's women characters who apparently are in great favor with the critics).  However, faced with an unusually long summer I decided to throw caution and avowals to the wind and give the author one more chance.  With Lonesome Dove, McMurtry returns to the theme of the vanishing frontier, a subject he broached earlier in his career with his novel, Leaving Cheyenne, one of his best efforts, but a book that received little attention when compared with that lavished on his \\"blockbusters\\".  Simply put, Lonesome Dove is not only is best novel but must rank with the best American novels of the last half of the twentieth century.<br /><br />McMurtry's tale of two aging Texas Rangers who decide to take a herd of cattle to the Montana Territory from the lower Rio Grande area of Texas borrows from two literary traditions: (1) the picturesque novels once wildly popular in Europe, and (2) those novels (uniquely American)that deal with the human inclination to search for some mystical absolute, be it white whales or to see the first herd of longhorns in Montana.  It is because McMurtry understands that what he is describing is much more than just a cattle drive, that this novel stands so far above the rest of western and cowboy fiction.  However, in spite of what some reviewers claim, this novel is not the \\"American War and Peace;\\" it takes much more than length to make a great novel and regardless how much McMurtry achieves with Lonesome Dove, he is no Tolstoy.	2005-10-10

She was a precocious seven when her parents announced they were moving from Los Angeles to backwater Ahmednagar.<br /><br />It was there that the guru they had been devoted to since their drugged-out Berkeley college days, Meher Baba (who Brown credits with the saying, \\"Don't worry, be happy), had established an ashram. \\"Its residents usually explained where it was by saying, `Get on a train in Bombay, and go east for nine hours.' \\"<br /><br />From the start, Brown was appalled. \\"I didn't care about Baba....But I knew there was nothing I could do. There was already an envelope in Dad's dresser drawer containing three one-way tickets to India.\\" Over the next five years a deep component of sheer misery would be added to that feeling of shock and helplessness.<br /><br />She opens the book with an account of one of their rare vacations. The ashram \\"was located in what I had previously thought of as the most desolate place in India. But the expanse of brown-baked weeds about a hundred miles west of Ahmednagar was giving it some serious competition.\\"<br /><br />Stranded, Brown reads a fantasy novel while her parents squabble about whose fault it is there is no train to their mountain hotel.<br /><br />\\"The novel's heroine, Harry, was a foreign girl who gets kidnapped by desert nomads and learns to ride bareback and do magic.<br /><br />\\"Certainly I could identify with the `kidnapped and taken to a foreign desert' part, though I wished I were enjoying my experience as much as Harry was enjoying hers. I also wished three of her magnificent desert steeds would appear, so we could ride them up the mountain.<br /><br />\\"Mom poked me. `Don't just sit there with your nose in a book. Pray with me.'<br /><br />\\"On second thought, perhaps only one steed.\\"<br /><br />This pretty much sums up the family dynamic. Brown spent as much time as possible buried in a book, while her mother's response to everything was to chant, \\"Baba, Baba, Baba,\\" and her father kept clear of the fray as much as possible.<br /><br />Even the escape into books was made difficult. The ashram librarian was an unkempt, irascible Indian who took immediate exception to the compound's only child snooping around his tiny, dusty domain and began screaming at her to \\"Get out!\\" before they were even introduced.<br /><br />School was even worse. A Catholic school where Brown was the only foreigner, it had  English textbooks but classes were taught in Hindi. Brown, who had been an exceptional student, was soon failing. She might have overcome the language barrier if not for the sadism of her teacher, a type (not rare enough) whose professional zeal seems focused on the opportunity to bully those who can't fight back.<br /><br />On her first day Brown took comfort in the thought that \\"Manija,\\" the hated name that set her apart in America, would not be a problem in India and neither would its diminutive, \\"Mani,\\" which rhymes with money. But after Mrs. Joshi introduced her to the class, she had the students open their books to a comic rhyme that poked fun at \\"Mani Mao,\\" baby talk for \\"Mrs. Cat.\\" Brown was thereafter known as Mani Mao and pelted with stones in the schoolyard and whenever spotted alone on the streets of the town.<br /><br />As for her name, Brown changed it to Rachel the minute she graduated high school back in America and now delivers a word of warning: \\"Parents, if you do not want your children to write tell-all memoirs when they grow up, do not name them KhrYstYll, Pebble, or Shaka Zulu.\\"<br /><br />The ashram itself seems primarily populated by misfits and the mentally ill, whose ranks are routinely swelled with pilgrims from America. In all her years there Brown made only one friend, a boy who stayed for some months and whose father was one of the deranged visitors. Her accounts of their role-playing adventuresare the only carefree, unfettered moments in the book. The adult she most admired was, in the end, responsible for the most harrowing, disillusioning and cruel incident in her childhood.<br /><br />Although the life she describes is miserable, Brown herself never appears pitiable. Although resigned, she remains full of spunk and spirit, saved by her imagination. She never connected to Baba or spiritual life in general and comes across as practical, independent, driven and engaging.

She breathes in the special qualities of \\"old-growth\\" air and mourns the lack of \\"grandfather trees,\\" but most fascinating are the tales of interwoven life in the trees.<br /><br />Many of these have to do with insects. Black locusts produce extra nectar, which feeds the ants and ladybugs that protect the tree from other insects. Except aphids, which the ants protect in exchange for their \\"honeydew,\\" a euphemism for aphid urine.  Ladybugs eat aphids, but there are still plenty of them and that honeydew is also the substance found all over your car when you park it under a tree, that stuff you probably call sap.<br /><br />Exploring the teeming life of a tree  (without the sycamore alone nine other species would be lost) Maloof, a biologist, distills numerous studies and traces the relationships among the insects, lizards, fungi, mammals, birds and people who obtain benefit from the tree. With a winning combination of science and poetry, Maloof makes her case for compassion and wonder.<br /><br />--Portsmouth Herald	2005-10-10

The dissection is needed to detect evidence or to expose the lack thereof. The reason analysis of images is needed is that all of the images are not natural. They are iconic based on conventions (like language) and therefore Christian images are signs. The discipline to investigate them is not the neuropsychology of perception but semiotics, the science of signs. Here we have an excellent semiotic rhetoric of Christian images informing us of the meaning of the signs and the meaning behind the images given to us by an expert in both religion (John Drury is a priest) and in the history of art. The cross, the scourging pillar, the spear and the sponge on a cane -all these have meaning. Particularly interesting was Chapter three with the dissection of the different presentations of the annunciation by Duccio as compared to Lippi and Poussin and the biblical quotes that supported each artist's view of what happened and how it happened.	2005-10-10

Dick	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Philip - I am alive, but perhaps you are too	At the start I wondered about this biography - how personal it is. It's like those documentaries of dinosaurs and alien worlds that are so realistic, so convincing - I have to keep reminding myself that they aren't real - they're just imaginative realisations. So it is with Mr Carrere's biography. Because I have devoured all of PKD's works - over and over again - he made SUCH an impression on me - I was concerned that I might have hated this psuedo biography.<br /><br />But, in fact I loved it. It is so much easier to read than the excerpts of the Exegesis that I have read. It struggles to make sense of those rambling thoughts of a man who, by all measures, was not an ordinary thinker. And the 'imagined' insights into PKD and the way his life developed have a validity generated from the fact that the novels and short stories (and I know these so well) are a source of these insights.<br /><br />What is especially pleasing about this biography is that it doesn't pretend to understand PKD's extraordinary beliefs and behaviour, neither does it gloss the man or try to turn him into a saint.<br /><br />Read Lawrence Sutin's biography - 'Divine Invasions' - for a less imaginative study of PKD's life (not to say unemotional - Sutin's biography drew more emotional response from me that did Carrere's), but add to it, by all means, with Mr Carrere's biography.<br /><br />Of course, there is absolutely no substitute to reading PKD's own writing. Don't think the movies are a substitute either although they are a wonderful indicator of respect for PKD - and I can't wait to see what they do with 'A Scanner Darkly'.<br /><br />recommendations:<br /><br />all the short stories of PKD<br /><br />all the novels of PKD (including the mainstream novels - not SF)<br /><br />'Divine Invasions - A Life of Philip K Dick' by Lawrence Sutin<br /><br />the movies 'Blade Runner', 'The Minority Report'	2005-10-10

The Novak family is introduced with the sudden death of Mr. Novak which leaves his wife and five children facing tough times at the onset.  Their mother Rose, an Italian woman who had enough will at a young age to marry a Polish man in a divided immigrant community, keeps her family going, although the youngest children, Lucy and Sandy, have a different upbringing from their older brother and sisters, Georgie, Dorothy, and Joyce, missing the security and discipline of their father.  The unique and earnest way each of the Novak children struggle to find their place in the world, coming from an isolated town of indigent immigrant families, makes Baker Towers a compelling and sympathetic novel.<br /><br />The Novak siblings don't always get along.  They keep secrets from each other, feel burdened by shame and guilt, and at times give up trying to understand:  why does Georgie settle in Philadelphia after his military service instead of coming straight home to the woman he loves?  What is Dorothy looking for in D.C.?  Joyce is naive to join the military expecting to see the world; Sandy shows no conscience in his shifty pursuit of easy money; and Lucy, she could be so beautiful, if she'd just lose weight.  Their relationships with Rose, their aging mother, is no less complicated and real.  But it's not their eagerness to leave home and the ensuing disappointments they overcome that drives Baker Towers, it is why and how they return to Bakerton.<br /><br />Haigh describes their hometown of Bakerton in deliberate detail giving poignancy, a soul, to its striving, its heyday and decline.  When the Novak children turn their backs on everything Bakerton stands for - the mines, in particular; the cause of their father's death - the emotional pull drawing each one back culminates in their discovery of both what is most meaningful in life, love and living honestly, and what has been lost to them forever.<br /><br />Haigh seeps Baker Towers with a mood that is dreamy and contented and never falters.  The pages turn like a zoetrope as the Novak's lives unfold, and the Towers - the two sepulchral mounds of mine waste haunting the novel from beginning to end - grow larger.  An inevitable ending - the fate of small mining towns - comes as a shock when the people of Bakerton come together in the face of tragedy.  After the mines are finally closed and the Towers are turned into landfill, what's left is a time in American history which Haigh masterfully recreates in this warm and touching novel.nd living honestly, and what has been lost to them forever. <br /> <br />Haigh seeps Baker Towers with a mood that is dreamy and contented and never falters.

Since then, I have had the opportunity to visit Savannah (thanks Mom for moving to Georgia) and decided to re-read it after touring many of the places featured in the book, such as Mercer House and Clary's diner.  The book is even better when you are familiar with the town.<br /><br />As is probably well known, the book is separated into two parts.  The first part presents a picture of Savannah and its unusual inhabitants.  The writing is exceptional and draws the reader into its environment.  One gets the feel for how isolated Savannah is from the rest of the country and, indeed, even from the rest of Georgia.  The result is an eccentric town that has gone its own way and wants to keep it that way.<br /><br />The second part of the book details the several murder trials of antiques dealer Jim Williams.  This story would have been remarkable had it occurred anywhere.  That it took place in the social isolation chamber of Savannah makes it that much more delicious.  As an aside, let me state that a tour of the Mercer House does give one a greater appreciation for Jim Williams' lifestyle and success.  What a setting for a real life crime story.<br /><br />If you do happen to get down to Savannah, allow me to tell you of a great souvenir.  Jim Williams' neighbor, Virginia Duncan, is mentioned at the beginning of Chapter 10.  She and her husband run a print and map shop on Monterey Square and they sell books not only signed by the author (a dime a dozen in Savannah) but also signed by Minerva, the voodoo priestess featured in the book.  Now that is a keepsake.	2005-10-10

The violence perpetuated against toys and people in this novel is enough to make the hardiest person squirm. <br /> <br />Brom's art is excellent and highly imaginative. His paintings are the book's high point, and it is great that he could make a story and do his own images for it. In doing that, they complement each other very well. <br /> <br />The story, though, is not a showstopper. For the most part, it is pure hacknslash dungeon crawl, and I suppose for some that might be right up their alley. But, it does get points for being involving enough to keep you leapfrogging from one piece of Brom artwork to another. <br /> <br />Now, hopefully Brom will get back to work in his dark cellar and work on another illustrated novel, one that has a bit more to it than a monster that could have been Randall Flagg's pet. <br /> <br />And that is no dig on Brom. Rather, it should be a compliment. <br />Just remember to not let the kids read this.	2005-10-10

But will helping Jane help him or will he find himself in more trouble than he thought possible?<br /><br />Jane and Hellion had the potential of being wonderful characters but Ms. Raleigh just didn't cash in all of the potential that was there.  Add to this the concept of a regency miss traveling to London sans chaperone, attending balls and other society functions sans chaperone, and having a head for business (okay not that big of a deal but still) and you get the picture of modern day thoughts going into this historical read.  In the end this is not a read I'd avoid as Ms. Raleigh is a fine storyteller but this effort was lackluster in attempt and execution.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Design	2005-10-10

This book, while mostly fluent and often entertaining, is fundamentally flawed.   <br /> <br />(In the interest of full disclosure, I come to this judgment as a fan of both G. W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, as a Catholic-raised and Jesuit-minded atheist, as an open 'bisexual' who rejects the notion of 'gay' identity, as a well-read fan of the likes of G.K. Chesterton, Christopher Hitchens, Ann Coulter, Ayn Rand, Camille Paglia and William F. Buckley, and as a reader who wanted to like this book.) <br /> <br />The work has three main flaws.  It is too ambitious for the skill and effort demonstrated.  It preaches to the choir. And it is gratuitously snide and self-contradictorily condescending. <br /> <br />The book gets off to a rough start on page three where D'Souza begins:  <br /> <br />     \\"The term \\"liberal,\\" in its [!] Greek meaning....\\"    <br /> <br />This is a sloppy mistake from a Stanford scholar and former senior White House analyst.  \\"Liber-\\" is a Latin root, the Greek for free(man) is \\"eleutheros.\\"  The author and editor both deserve a ruler across the knuckles from Fr. Grammaticus, S.J., for that mistake.   <br /> <br />Saying he has matured from his sophomoric days, D'Souza tries to hard to be serious yet funny.  At best, he comes across as less witty than Buckley, less biting than Coulter, less self-aware than Paglia, and totally out of Rand's league, whom he damns with faint praise in his suggested reading list.  (Perhaps this last comparison is unfair.) <br /> <br />And, of course, as D\\"Souza says, making \\"lefties\\" turn apoplectic is loads of fun.  A politically correct, tweed-and-goateed college professor once told my (all white) literature class that we were all \\"ignorant racists\\" who \\"couldn't even prove [we] exist[ed.]\\" In response, the editor of my college paper threw a penknife at the prof's head which stuck in the wall behind him with a thud, six inches from his left ear.  When asked whether the knife \\"existed?\\" the professor responded, \\"Classdismissed.\\"  D'Souza's reported college exploits pale in comparison. <br /> <br />Second, the book never puts forth any original solutions or formulations.  It merely reassures an admittedly \\"young conservative\\" that liberals are often worth laughing at.  This may be quite true, but Republican Ann Coulter and (?post-)Marxist Christopher Hitchens do so, write so, and say so much better.  Their works are quite highly recommended.   <br /> <br />D'Souza offers no arguments other than the implied equation Christian=moral=Republican=Justified <br /> <br />Finally, D'Souza's repeated jabs at homosexuals are inappropriate, and his suggestion that conservatives \\"forget about\\" the 'black' vote is abominable.   <br /> <br />His homophobic (a word I hate, but which here has no substitute,) references are embarrassing.   <br /> <br />At one point, D'Souza nervously jokes that a man says: <br />      \\"I approve of homosexuality he said, half in Ernest.\\"  [Sic.]   <br /> <br />During college orientation, the fetching D'Souza is told to \\"look the person on either side of him\\" and realize that at least \\"one of the three\\" would have a homosexual experience before leaving college.  Rather than ask, as I did at mine, \\"How do you know, and what gives you the right to lecture me on the topic?\\" he makes a mental note to \\"avoid\\" the two men for his stay at Dartmouth.  Fearing what?  This is more like a bad frat joke than the work of a serious scholar. <br /> <br />He describes the homosexuality as a \\"lifestyle\\" choice, yet also seems to believe that homosexuality is involuntary.  He conflates the \\"gay\\" movement (which he sometimes seems to realize is a silly modern leftist aberration) with _homosexuality_ which is universal in all cultures.   <br /> <br />[The curious and unafraid \\"young conservative\\" should research the words _shaman_ and _berdache_ and the stories of Achilles, Hadrian, and Alexander the Great, and their loves.]   <br />   <br />And while I agree entirely with D'Souza'scritique of `gay' marriage, (for which he puts forth no serious arguments) I don't see him reaching out here to young homosexual conservatives.  We do exist. <br /> <br />His comments on homosexuality in the military were ignorant, and frankly incoherent.  (Again, see the Greeks) <br /> <br />He also nominally distinguishes between individuals of `African-American' (i.e., former-slave) heritage and the existence of a so-called `black community.'  Yet he advocates that Republicans \\"give up\\" on blacks and work on attracting Latinos and Asians as a more expedient political tactic.  This is rank Us-versus-Them tribalism. Partisanship - not principle. <br /> <br />[And, by Asians, does he mean Anatolians?] <br /> <br />To be brief, after reading Christopher Hitchens' work \\"Letters to a Young Contrarian\\" in the same series, I fully hoped to enjoy this book.  But I cannot say it was worth the purchase price. <br /> <br />I rated it with one star to weight the bias of reviews that praise it, the book is worth perhaps two or two-and-a-half, if one is charitable. <br /> <br />I have not read D'Souza's other works, yet am willing to give him a second chance - from a lending library. <br /> <br />Pick up a copy of Ann Coulter's paperback edition of \\"How to Talk to a Liberal\\" Instead.	2005-10-10

Kayama, a lawyer, attends a surfing contest at the request of a client's son, but runs into her cousin who is competing.  However, she's also present when he receives a threat, an ancient Hawaiian weapon that indicates a call to battle. Storm soon finds herself investigating more than just a threat.  The surfing competition soon leads to violence and murder.<br /><br />The \\"green room\\" is the underwater space where a wave shoves a surfer or where they dive to escape the crushing water.  In Atkinson's novel, it's not only an actual threat to Storm's life, but also indicative of the pressure from all sides, the Hawaiian surfers who want to keep the sport pure, the promoters who want to capitalize on commercialism, the clash between cultures.<br /><br />Atkinson uses the Hawaiian culture and language, as well as the surfing story to show the forces that can tear a family, a sport, or an island apart.	2005-10-10

As we now see frightening signs of such faith-based extremism in its early forms beginning to take hold in the United States and we watch Europe engulfed in a clash of civilizations, it is in the interest of every world citizen to understand the phenomenon for what it is. Since September 2001 I have noticed more than the usual level of abuse of the phrases, \\"By God\\" and \\"Wallah.\\" It seems we are convinced whatever fleeting thought passes through our heads is a lightning bolt sent from upon high.<br /><br />Sir Winston Churchill understood fanaticism. The following is from his book \\"The River Wars\\":<br /><br />\\"Few facts are so encouraging to the student of human development as the desire, which most men and all communities manifest at all times, to associate with their actions at least the appearance of moral right. However distorted may be their conceptions of virtue, however feeble their efforts to attain even to their own ideals, it is a pleasing feature and hopeful augury that they should wish to be justified. The sufferings of a people or class may be intolerable, but before they take up arms and risk their lives some unselfish and impersonal spirit must animate them. In countries where there is education and mental activity or refinement, this high motive is found in the pride of glorious traditions or in a keen sympathy with surrounding misery. Ignorance deprives savage nations of such incentives. Yet in the marvelous economy of nature this very ignorance is a source of greater strength. It affords them the mighty stimulus of fanaticism. ... It [fanaticism] gives men something which they think is sublime to fight for, and this serves them as an excuse for wars which it is desirable to begin for totally different reasons. Fanaticism is not a cause of war. It is the means that helps savage peoples to fight. It is the spirit that enables them to combine -- the great common object before which all personal or tribal disputes become insignificant. What the horn is to the rhinoceros, what the sting is to the wasp, the Mohammedan faith was to the Arabs of the Sudan -- a faculty of offence or defense. It was all this and no more ... Those whose practice it is to regard their own nation as possessing a monopoly of virtue and common-sense, are wont to ascribe every military enterprise of savage peoples to fanaticism. They calmly ignore obvious and legitimate motives. The most rational conduct is considered mad. It is, perhaps, an historical fact that the revolt of a large population has never been caused solely or even mainly by religious enthusiasm.\\"<br /><br />So it is that men like Churchill can become great statesmen. They understand the tools by which populations are manipulated.

However, if there is a central theme to this book that I can grasp, it is a sort of Freudian notion that trauma as children, and particularly rejection by parental figures, leads - in the case of Sophy and Matty - to profound and irreversable damage later in life.   <br /> <br />Sophy's decent into depravity started not with drugs or sexual experimentation, but with rejection by her father.  As Golding describes it, with obvious Freudian overtones, as a small girl she attempted to woo him, succeeding only once in getting him to take her for a walk.  During this walk, the young girl wished her mother and sister would never return - even wished they would die - so she would not have to share her father ever again.  Later, there is her subsequent curiousity about the \\"auntie's\\" bedroom, and what may have transpired there; and her terrible jealousy about her father's impending second marriage.   <br /> <br />The frustrated craving for parental love is less obvious in Matty, but nevertheless present.  Matty's craving for affection becomes fixated on the pederast Pedigree, a sort of unwitting reciprocity of the latter's perverted passions, which may have led Matty to murder his rival Henderson.  A desire to redeem himself and win Pedigree's approval becomes the defining feature of the rest of Matty's life. <br /> <br />The final irony in the book is that Matty, who has absolutely nothing in life, nevertheless finds a sort of redemption in the end, in spite of his slide towards insanity and the occult.  On the other hand, by the time the story ends it is obvious that Sophy, who to all outward appearances had every advantage in life, has become an irredemable sociopath.  While wounds from war and fire can be mended, there are some less visable scars that never heal.	2005-10-10

What is sexy instead is sex.  On the wilder shores of academia, an interest in French philosophy has given way to a fascination with French kissing.  In some cultural circles, the politics of masturbation exert far more fascination than the politics of the Middle East.  Socialism has lost out to sado-masochism.  Among students of culture, the body is an immensely fashionable topic, but it is usually the erotic body, not the famished one.  There is a keen interest in coupling bodies, but not in labouring ones.  Quietly spoken middle-class students huddle diligently in libraries, at work on sensationalist subject like vampirism and eye-gouging, cyborgs and porno movies\\" (2-3). <br /> <br />According to Eagleton, this particular development in theory has enabled teachers and students of Cultural Studies to engage the pleasures (the politics of consumption) of everyday life, \\"only at the risk of losing their ability to subject it to critique.\\"  Given the current state of theory, Eagleton asks, \\"[w]hat kind of fresh thinking does this new era demand?\\" <br /> <br />In response to the nihilism of our current post-9-11 period-- the age of corporate capitalism and intensified U.S. imperial hegemony-- prolific Filipino cultural theorist E. San Juan, Jr. offers WORKING THROUGH THE CONTRADICTIONS: FROM CULTURAL THEORY TO CRITICAL PRACTICE, a collection of classic and new essays.  San Juan provides insightful, innovative, and fresh thinking that opens critical spaces for us to imagine new ways of resituating desire beyond the boundaries of individual consumption and toward the realm of collective social transformation and spiritual renewal.  What marks San Juan's project as \\"different\\" in our contemporary intellectual landscape of \\"end-isms\\" (end of theory, end of history, end of ideology, etc.) is its commitment to a liberatory vision for genuine social change and freedom.  In his introduction, San Juan explains: \\"My project here is to affirm [that]... alternatives exit... We face hard choices every day as we shoulder the nightmarish burden of history.  Although there are no guarantees one way or the other, it bears repeating that the world is open for us to re-invent or construct anew, and the future is here for us to shape if we dare imagine it, in accord with our collective desire for equality, justice, happiness, and liberation.\\"    <br /> <br />WORKING THROUGH THE CONTRADICTIONS is divided into three parts: Embarkations, Trajectories, and Rendezvous.  In part one, San Juan embarks on the project of dialectically seizing the contradictions of contemporary globalization in relation to the current state of Cultural Studies and American Studies.  Examining Marx, Engels (his unique contribution to theorizing aesthetics and cultural politics), Lukacs, Gramsci, and Raymond Williams, San Juan generates a genealogy of historical materialist thought, which provides the foundation for an insurgent model of Cultural Studies.  In the final chapter of this section, San Juan meditates on \\"Third World\\" articulations of surrealism (Cesaire, Vallejo, etc.), an aesthetics of subversion. <br /> <br />In part two, San Juan turns to Frantz Fanon as a cultural critic, whose writings enable us to confront racial injustice on a global scale (or what African American scholar-activist Manning Marable calls global apartheid) as well as to engage the on-going necessity of national liberation and self-determination for those in the Global South and in the internal colonies of the United States.  Pushing against orthodox postcolonialism, San Juan's re-assessment of Fanon brings U.S. Empire to the fore in a way that sheds light on the repressed history of U.S.-Philippines relations-- the latter was brutally colonized by the former at the turn of the 20th century (Spanish American War, 1898; Filipino American War, 1899-1914). <br /> <br />Part three reveals various ways in which subalterns have always spoken.  Currently, 10 million Filipino migrant workers (female and male laboring bodies) are dispersed around the globe.  In this final section of the book, San Juan concretizes his insurgent model of Cultural Studies by examining the counterhegemonic narratives of Filipino migrant workers; assessing the works of Toni Morrison, Kiana Davenport, David Henry Hwang; considering philosopher Benedict de Spinoza's \\"principle of the inalienability of human rights [which] can renew the impulse for reaffirming the ideal of radical, popular democracy.\\"  San Juan uses Spinoza to help us understand new forms of racialization in our post 9-11 era, especially with regard to multiple forms of racist violence (racial profiling, deportations, violations of civil liberties) directed at Asian American communities.  In the Afterword, San Juan explores how the work of progressive African American writer and journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal (imprisoned on death row since 1982) embodies Spinoza's concept of freedom: \\"Genuine freedom always involves a collective process of becoming-free.\\" <br /> <br />In this stunning collection of essays, E. San Juan, Jr.-- one of our most important Filipino/Asian American critical thinkers and scholar-activists-- addresses an astoundingly wide range of issues and debates within Cultural Studies in our age of globalization.  WORKING THROUGH THE CONTRADICTIONS (with a Foreword by literary critic Barbara Harlow) is useful for all teachers and students in Cultural Studies, U.S. Ethnic and Racial Studies, American Studies, Comparative Literary Studies, Critical Theory, Globalization Studies, Women's Studies, and U.S. Empire Studies.  We may find answers to Eagleton's question about the future of theory in WORKING THROUGHTHE CONTRADICTIONS.	2005-10-10

This book only lists 1-75 (1/64th scale) Matchbox cars which is fine for my use.  It is good becasue it lists all models in alphabetical order so you can cross-reference the number (1-75) of the model - most model numbers are not imprinted on late model cars so it is helpful in that respect.  However, I found it lacking in the number of variations it listed.  There is no consistent differentiation between wheel type (other than RW and SF), interior color, stickers/decals or other minor variations.  This guide does not use the same numbering system as Charlie Mack's Encyclopedia (e.g. 14 A 3) making it difficult to have the references compliment each other.  This guide does list more recent models where as Charlie Mack's guide is typically long overdue when a new edition comes out.  But again, this one is not as complete regarding model variation so you may not know if you are collecting all the variations of a particular model you want in your collection.  Another positive point of this book though is that not all pictures are of perfect cars -- the cars in the photos have a little play wear and is more reflective a practical collectors cars rather than some ideal collection most of us will never have.   Lastly, in comparison to Charlie Mack's guide, I find it nice becasue most of this book does dedicate it's picture space to the 1-75 models.  One of the dissappointments I have found with Mr. Mack's guide is that it lists a lot of subtle variation (i.e. light blue, mid blue and dark blue Soopa Coopa) but does not show pictures on how to tell the difference (neither does this one -- it doesn't even try to differentiate).  Also, much of the picture space in Mr. Mack's guide is with models that no one I know really collects (i.e. NOT 1-75 series, super kings and models of yesteryear).  I'm still not sure where 1/2 of the pics in Charlie Macks book come from (I've been collecting MB superfast for 20 years) -- perhaps thats why it is called an encyclopedia.  Dana Johnson's book simplifies things but does not take it to the next level by any means. <br /> <br />Basically, I use Dana Johnson's book as a supplement to find model numbers so I can look up varaitions in late model cars in Charlie Mack's guide.  I do think Mr. Macks guide can be too complete, in that it lists more model variations than most people can possibly collect.  However, Dana Johnson's guide is too incomplete.  I prefer Mr. Macks guide becasue it lists all known variations and allows me to decide which variations I think are significant to collect.	2005-10-10

However, there is A LOT that can be accomplished in the Visual Basic language and I find learning VB as a really nice leisure time in between classes, learning hardcore material, or just wanting to enter new territory.<br /><br />For anyone else who reviews this, please recognize what this book is (and perhaps what it is not): this is a \\"NUTSHELL\\" title -- It is not meant to be a defintive tutorial. In fact, the author blatantly states in the preface that the people who will get the most out of this book are those who already have knowledge of VB and are looking for something to refresh their memories or use as a desktop reference.<br /><br />Now the latter phrase, desktop reference, is exactly what this book is. While the book can be divided into an 'explanation' section and a 'reference' section, the explanations are NOT complete, and are really just broad overviews of the particular subjects a section covers.<br /><br />I know: I mentioned that I wasn't a VB coder (although I'm not a novice either), and yes, I purchased this book knowing this. I don't recommend this approach for everyone, but this works for me. I've learned a lot from this reference, and I'm able to implement a lot of what I've read. The reference section is excellent. So yes, I've used this as a \\"bootleg textbook\\".<br /><br />Other than the fact that good books on VB 6.0 are a little hard to come by nowadays (everything's VB.NET), this is a good start for someone who doesn't want their hands held the whole way and are okay with starting off \\"in the middle of nowhere\\" and trekking through unknown territory.

Jane became a TV anchor, but has now just published her first self-help book \\"How To Have The Perfect Life\\". Maddy, Amy, and Christine are thrilled for Jane, until they realize that Jane has used their lives as bad examples! The three decide to prove Jane wrong. They each have one year to face their biggest fear.  <br /> <br />Christine Ashton is the doctor if the group. She has finished her residency and now works in an ER as a trauma specialist. It is a hard and exhausting job that only the toughest can pull off. But Christine has lots of courage, except when it comes to heights. Maddy and Amy decide that Christine's challenge is to join her family for their skiing vacation at Silver Mountain during the holiday season and conquer her fear of the chairlift. So Christine hires a ski instructor and arrives a week before her family is due. She knows how to ski but needs to face the chairlift problem before her older brother, Robbie, arrives.  <br /> <br />Christine's father has always been proud of Robbie. Yet nothing Christine ever did was good enough. All er life Christine has wanted a simple smile from her dad, perhaps hear him say \\"Well done\\" or \\"I'm proud of you\\" just once. Now her chance has come! Christine has been offered a job in the ER of St. James, where she'd be working with colleagues her father respects. She can prove her worth to them. Perhaps they will tell her father how much of a success she is and maybe, just maybe, she'll earn his pride.  <br /> <br />Alec Hunter oozes charm and everybody likes him, including Christine. But she thinks he is just an unemployed ski bum. He plans to prove how wrong she is about him. After they finish helping a victim of a snowboarding accident, they both learn a lot about each other and become close. Very close. Now Christine has a new fear. Does she take the job of her dreams back home or give up everything for the man of her dreams?  <br /> <br/>***** A stellar novel! Comedy, romance, tension, it's all in here. Once you begin reading you will not want to stop. In fact, I did not stop reading until I finished the entire book ... and realized the night was almost over, dawn was on the horizon. Therefore, I highly suggest you pick up a copy of this book and don't start reading until the weekend.

I don't know how she did it! Author Brette McWhorter Sember, J.D. has given us the ultimate plan for surviving divorce with dignity -- in a book you won't want to hide from your spouse.  <br /> <br />While \\"No-Fight Divorce: Spend Less Money, Save Time, and Avoid Conflict Using Mediation\\" covers every last detail of this typically overwhelming life challenge, reading the book itself is not the least bit overwhelming. From the pros and cons of mediation, to finding out if you're a good candidate, to locating the right mediator, the author anticipates every question and provides clear and simple answers, without animosity toward either sex. It thoroughly explains how to negotiate property, parenting, and money issues and how to deal with sticking points. The book addresses fears you haven't even thought of yet and answers questions like, \\"What if you have no idea what's reasonable,\\" and \\"What if your spouse makes last minute changes or demands?\\"  <br />   <br />Boy, do I wish this book had been around during my divorce. After our first mediation session my ex exploded and I gave up, out of fear and lack of knowledge. Sure, we read other books, but they either missed the point entirely or contained that conversation-busting chapter that should be titled, \\"How to rip off your soon-to-be ex.\\"  \\"No-Fight Divorce\\" is sure to bring much better short and long-term results for all. In fact, I plan to pass my copy along to friends who are considering mediation. I have no doubt it will be well-received on both fronts.  <br />	2005-10-10

This is often because too many books about astrology are nothing more than \\"cookbooks\\" that list large amounts of information in lengthy lists intended to help the reader interpret the meanings of when particular planets appear in specific signs or houses in an individual's birthchart.  Sometimes, they will include similar interpretations about aspects between planets in the birthchart. Less often, they might include interpretations about transiting planets, but usually nothing about progressing planets.  What results too often from these astrology \\"cookbooks\\" is confusion for readers because few of these \\"cookbooks\\" describe how to identify what the important significant parts of a birthchart are or how to synthesize the information into a meaningful whole.  Without such an understanding, it becomes impossible to tackle the more difficult concepts of predictive astrology.<br /><br />Recently I read Steven Forrest's 1983 book \\"The Inner Sky: How To Make Wiser Choices for a More Fulfilling Life\\".  In this book, Mr. Forrest provided an elegant set of guidelines that enable novice students of astrology to grasp what the most important features in a birthchart are so that a concise synthesis of the lengthy amount of information contained within it can be effectively navigated and understood without falling prey to information overload.  Being greatly inspired by this book, I decided to read Mr. Forrest's next book, \\"The Changing Sky: A Practical Guide to Predictive Astrology\\", which was first published in 1986.  As in the \\"The Inner Sky\\", Mr. Forrest provides a definitive set of guidelines in \\"The Changing Sky\\" that are highly beneficial.  In order to gain any meaningful information from predictive astrology, both transiting and progressing planets must be compared to an individual's birthchart.  As the birthchart is a snapshot of the sky when a person is born, transits are the actual locations of the planets at a time later in the individual's life.  Hence, transiting planets make aspects with the locations that the planets were in at the time of an individual's birth.  These transiting aspects can mark significant events that most people experience (such as the first Saturn return at about the age of 30 or a transmitting outer planet making a conjunction with a natal Ascendant, Midheaven, Sun or Moon, for example).  Understanding progressions is a bit more difficult than transits because (1) there are multiple progression techniques used by astrologers and (2) progressions don't necessarily relate directly to actual locations of planets.  Progressions are created by astrologers using a symbolic time frame of reference.  The most common progression technique that astrologers use (and is what Mr. Forrest explains very well in \\"The Changing Sky\\") is called \\"secondary progressions\\".  In secondary progressions, the movements that the planets experience in one day relate to one year's life for an individual based upon that individual's birth time.  In this way, as the slow-moving outer planets can influence people for years at a time, in progressions, the fast-moving inner planets slow down and have similar influences that can affect people for years at a time.  This is actually one of the key factors used in predictive astrology: the longer a transiting or progressing planet can aspect with a significant natal planet, Ascendant or Midheaven in an individual's birthchart, the greater the impact that a transiting or progressing planet can have.  This concept helps to form the basis for the four \\"nets\\" that Mr. Forrest describes in the eleventh chapter of \\"The Changing Sky\\".  By understanding how long a particular planet can transit or progress through an aspect with the birthchart (as well as knowing which transmitting/progressing planets are themost important), particular transits and progressions can be divided into different nets that represent different levels of importance, either over long periods of time or shorter periods.  A progressing planet changing signs and/or houses may also be significant.  Fast-moving transiting inner planets may act as triggers within the larger scheme of the longer-lasting transits and progressions.<br /><br />Mr. Forrest separated the 13 chapters contained within \\"The Changing Sky\\" into five parts.  The first part (two chapters) focuses on the \\"root prediction\\", which is the birthchart.  The second part (four chapters) focuses on transmits and includes discussions of the teacher & trickster sides of the outer planets, as well as the meanings of the transiting inner planets.  The third part (three chapters) is an overview of progressions and includes the teacher & trickster sides of the inner planets, except the Moon, which still moves too quickly when progressed.  Instead, an entire chapter (Chapter 9) is used to describe the progressed moon's meaning in signs and houses in a \\"cookbook\\" style.  The fourth part (one chapter) is a \\"cookbook\\"-style description of all the possible aspects that the progressed inner planets (except the Moon), Midheaven and Ascendant make with all of the natal planets, natal Midheaven and natal Ascendant.  Mr. Forrest's inclusion of this \\"cookbook\\"-style information is highly beneficial since I have never seen any other \\"cookbook\\"-style book ever include any progressed planet information.  The fifth and final part (three chapters) is a synthesis of all of the information in the previous four parts and includes an interesting astrological analysis of the life of Vincent Van Gogh.<br /><br />Overall, I rate Steven Forrest's book \\"The Changing Sky: A Practical Guide to Predictive Astrology\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding a methodological approach to predictive astrology. In my opinion, this book and Mr. Forrest's earlier book, \\"The Inner Sky: How To Make Wiser Choices for a More Fulfilling Life\\", are probably the best first books to read to begin a study of astrology.  I also recommend that you read \\"The Inner Sky\\" before reading \\"The Changing Sky\\" to gain the most benefit from both books.	2005-10-10

Yes, it is not perfect, but it sure is 1000% better than our current system. Yes, we need to cut Government spending, but until we do, let's make sure that everyone pays their fair share.  Just look at all the people who are getting a free ride under our current tax system.  <br /> <br />Some of the stupid statements like the wealthy will be paying less in taxes, and the poor will be paying more.   Da! Come on.  There are many wealthy people who pay little or no income tax because of all the loop-holes in our current system.  With the Fair Tax, the wealthy will have a tough time coming up with loop holes when they spend $500,000 on a new cabin cruiser.  As for the poor, the Fair Tax is the only system where the poor could end up paying no taxes.  Currently if someone is earning under the poverty level, they are still paying over 7% which is being withheld for S.S. and Medicare. With the Fair Tax their rebate check will cancel out any tax they will pay.  Also, if they don't spend all their income on new items, they end up receiving more in rebates than what their taxes will be. <br /> <br />Someone made the statement \\"But because this tax is revenue neutral, where there are winners there must be losers.\\"  This is true.  The losers are the illegal aliens, all the people who cheat on their taxes or who just don't bother to pay them, the drug dealers and all those receiving billions of dollars generated by their illegal activities.  If you are against the Fair Tax, you must have a concern for these losers. <br />  <br /> <br />It is pretty simple; the ones who are against the Fair Tax are either criminals, tax attorneys, IRS employees or idiots.   <br />	2005-10-10

The authors blame Islam for their conflicts with their father. The book was written with hate and very far from being subjective and scientific.

I am an avid collector of American Regional and International cookbooks, but found the title of this book offensive. I assumed it was written to mock rural whites, a people I know to be hardworking, self-reliant, and decent. I was wrong about this one. This book actually celebrates these people and their cuisine, and is one of the very best traditional American cookbooks in print. Great recipes for fried chicken, catfish, hushpuppies, collard greens, Hoppin John, cornbread, and biscuits, as well as rabbit, squirrel, and yes, even possum. The book has a folksy humor throughout, and the recipes are authentic. Books like this become even more precious as this and other American regional cuisines disappear under a blanket of bland corporate burger chains, sub shops, and pizza joints. Incidentally, several recent medical studies have shown that rural Appalachians who consume this traditional fare are far healthier than those who embrace the modern suburban diet of chain restaurant food! If you have any interest in traditional American cooking, this book is a must-own.	2005-10-10

In conjunction with the British journalist and former Times correspondent J.O.P Bland, he had authored two best selling books about the Chinese Royal Court at the Forbidden City, Peking (now Beijing).  Backhouse, by the time of his death, had lived in China for nearly 40 years.  The high esteem in which he had been held by students and scholars of Chinese history collapsed upon publication of this book by Hugh Trevor-Roper (HTR).  Trevor-Roper of course is the esteemed British historian and author of the classic \\"The Last Days of Hitler\\".  The \\"Hermit of Peking\\" is the first full biography of one of history's greatest scam artists, Sir Edmund Backhouse.  The pinnacle of Backhouse's achievements, the publication of \\"China under the Empress Dowager\\" in 1910, was found to be based on a forgery, one of many forgeries as it transpires, perpetuated by Backhouse, the ramifications of which continue to this day. <br /> <br />I first read of Backhouse in Diana Preston's book \\"The Boxer Rebellion\\", (a modern account of the siege of the Peking legations in 1900 by the Chinese Boxers) and again in Sterling Seagrave's \\"Dragon Lady\\", a revisionist biography of Tzu His, the Dowager Empress.  Both authors are not charitable about Backhouse, and both give a potted biography of the man, particularly in Seagrave's book.  In fact, Seagrave is particularly scathing and rightly so.  As a direct consequence of Backhouse's forgery of a diary supposedly by a high Manchu court official, and subsequent book publications based upon the diary, popular history regards the Dowager Empress as an evil, scheming, and manipulative woman, who went as far as having her own son murdered to maintain her grip on the regency of China.   <br /> <br />The \\"Hermit of Peking\\" gives a much fuller account of the life of Backhouse, and fills in more detail about the numerous frauds that Backhouse tried pull off.  Not only was Bland as co-author of \\"China under the Empress Dowager\\" a victim (Bland believed until his death that the diary could not have been a forgery) of Backhouse's fraudulent activities, but also G. Morrison, the renown Times Correspondent.  Even Oxford University and the British Government were taken in as HTR gleefully relates.  It is amazing that Backhouse got away with what he did without the greater world being aware of it, but HTR shows the reader how he did so (Backhouse's victim's embarrassment was one reason).  In part, \\"The Hermit of Peking\\" is a detective story as HTR pulls the threads of this tale together, sorts fact from the many fictions.  It is well written, and only in the final chapters does HTR delve into the literary pornography for which Backhouse is now famous for, and HTR does so with taste, sparing the reader the graphic details (Seagrave doesn't spare though).  Trevor-Roper relied on a number of sources, which in the main is the private correspondence of Bland and Morrison.  The author also had access to the archives of the Foreign Office and of one of Backhouse's former employers.  And of course, HTR uses Backhouse's own writings to point out historical contradictions and fabrications which can be verified with certainty.    <br /> <br />If there is a quibble with the book, it is that HTR doesn't dwell on the historical consequences of Backhouse's frauds and how it contributes to a long and widely held misconception of the final days of the Chinese Royal Court, the role which Tzu His played in it.  Many histories of China have relied on the writings of Backhouse as a historical source and reference, thus perpetuating the popular myth of the Dowager Empress as a ruthless leader of her people.  At times HTR is typically given to eloquent turns of phrase, making reading a little slow at times.  None the less, \\"The Hermit of Peking\\" is a stirring read, and despite its age, should be viewed as a companion to the much more recent \\"Dragon Lady\\" by Sterling Seagrave to flesh out one of the main characters of early 20th century Peking. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Some people feel constrained to make themselves like this book simply because of the subject matter, as a number of the reviews have taken great pains to point out, but I find it hard to believe that anyone thinks this book is actually good.<br /><br />I do not require that the characters be likeable for me to think a book is worthwhile, but if they are not, they should at least be interesting.  Yet every character in this book is thoroughly unpleasant and dull, both, with not a single characteristic to catch one's sympathy or even attention.<br /><br />The plot drags on interminably, there is a great deal of bigotry on all sides, and there is quite a lot of violence without the least bit of interesting action.  The writing is, at best, insipid and, at worst, laughable.  This book tries very, very hard to be important, to carry a Message, to be morally complex.  Instead, it is a suffocating mess of a story, full of pretention and as dry as a mummy's whisper.	2005-10-10

In this engrossing novel based on the life of middle weight boxing champion Stanley Ketchel the Ragtime era of the early 1900's is brought vividly to life. The story begins with Ketchel running away from home and riding the rails as a teen-aged hobo after a fight with his step father which he believes has resulted in his death. It progresses smoothly into his discovery as a boxing prospect while working as a bouncer in a saloon out West. It then chronicles his rise and astonishing record of wins and K.O.'s both in and out of his weight class. The descriptions of the fights are edge-of-your-seat exciting and gory in places. His womanizing ways are also marvelously and entertainingly evoked. The dialogue is crisp, realistic, and humorous throughout which is one of this author's major strengths along with painting a vivid picture of that time period. Boxing fans and readers who like historical/biographical novels will really get their money's worth out of this book!	2005-10-10

Lauren Weisberger's \\"Everyone Worth Knowing\\" centered around Bette, who left her job in investment banking and instead worked in a PR firm, helping the firm with organizing parties for celebrities, hosting events and others. In addition, the job also required Bette to meet up with people, be seen and basically party all night. Shortly after working for the PR firm, she was already making waves when a gossip column starting a rumor that she was dating Philip Weston, the hot and rich bachelor in New York City. The truth was she hardly knew the guy at all but because it was considered to be \\"good publicity\\" by her boss, she did not outwardly deny that. At the same time, Bette was always running into Sammy, the bouncer at a club that she and her co-workers frequented. Soon, the fine line between work and personal life for Bette began to disappear and she soon wondered if the job was worth it. <br /> <br />I thought this was a fun look at the world of PR people and the complexities of organizing or hosting events, the creative ways in which you get the media to cover your events. The character Bette was likeable enough, however there seems to be a lack of secondary development and I would have like to see the friendship between Bette and her best friend, Penelope developed more.

This is a story of the ghost of Scott Joplin and a piano he haunts.  His unrest is the result of his life-long anger in learning of his syphilitic death sentence, losing his second wife, Freddie, to pneumonia, and never being recognized and compensated for his musical genius.           Phoenix is what you may call a hip-hop prodigy whose talent to play the piano was overshadowed by her more marketable singing voice.  Her loving father is her over-bearing manager who is responsible for her success.  She has just been signed to a hip-hop label owned by entertainment mogul \\"G-Ronn\\" who reminds me of Def-Jam Records president Jay-Z.  \\"G-Ronn\\" was also her love interest until she has a \\"lapse in judgement\\" and agrees to a sexual tryst with a teenage fan.   Of course, the story ends up in the entertainment tabloids.        Joplin's ghost uses her to channel his drive to expose African American audiences to the ragtime genius of his time in the 21st century. While under Joplin's spell, Phoenix performs one of Joplin's operas on a talk show instead of singing her latest smash single!          Tananarive Due outdid herself on the historical context of this story mentioning James Resse Europe and his Clef Band, the infamous Herbert Wright (Europe's assassin), and W. C. Handy.  References were made to the historic Chestnut Valley neighborhood, the Rosebud Caf, and of course, Joplin's home all when St. Louis was in its Black entertainment heyday.          On the contemporary level, it was just \\"a'ight\\" that the heroine of the story happens to be a hip-hop star.  Not very original, but I read all 477 pages in a couple of days as I was looking forward to what was coming next.            The author also did a good job developing the characters on the historic andcontemporary side.  In fact, the characters are what really held my interest.  The detail spent on the characters was not spared but story development left me somewhat unsatisfied.  There were two issues of under aged sex that could have made the contemporary side of the story more substantial.  Also, I would have liked the piano to be a little more \\"demonic.\\"         When I finished the book, I felt I learned a little something about the history of African American musical culture...Jazz: America's only original art form.	2005-10-10

Newman, died of transfusion AIDS on May 14, 1985.  In time, this simple statement of fact will become familiar - only the name, date and gender will be changed. <br /> <br />It is a cruel irony that Ralph's obsessive search of life's purpose culminated in 1980 at the pinnacle of his career - five months before heart surgery and the infusion of AIDS contaminated blood. <br /> <br />The question of purpose has been the driving force behind the writing of this book.  As you read, you will be motivated to seek more information and as a result learn how, not what, to think about AIDS. <br /> <br />As you walk with Ralph through his darkest days you will feel an identity with him.  He too had hopes and dreams, was inspired by the beauty of nature, loved his family and the Star Spangled Banner brought a mist to his eyes.  In many ways he was a lot like you. <br /> <br />Beverly Newman was born and raised on a farm in North Dakota.  She lived in Colorado from 1980 until her death from Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma on July 27, 1998.   <br />Beverly's undaunted courage, devotion to family and her tenacious quest for answers, lead her to share her husband's story in the hope that sharing would inspire others to learn and grow. \\"Look forward - the answers are there - If we search for them, work for them, tomorrow we'll know.\\" <br /> <br />Submitted by Rachelle Mollohan, the author's daughter.	2005-10-10

In his book, The Twilight of Sovereignty, Wriston opined that in an era where information flows freely, \\"capital will always go where it is welcome and stay where it is well-treated.\\"  By capital, he meant not only money but human capital.   <br /> <br />With these words the late Mr. Wriston (who was actually Heenan's former boss and mentor) summarizes with eerie prescience Flight Capital's premise-- the United States can no longer count on attracting human capital from around the world as its birthright. <br /> <br />Heenan, former University of Hawaii School of Business Dean, Citicorp executive and currently trustee for the Estate of James Campbell in Hawaii, explains that after generations of importing the best brainpower to our shores, foreign-born, US educated technocrats are going back to the countries of their origin.  When our nation's best brains walk, they take with them intellectual capital, skills and an entrepreneurial edge that only an immigrant can muster.   <br /> <br />As America's human capital diminishes, so does this country's technological preeminence and with it, our economic supremacy.  This trend, says the author, will soon lead to a day or reckoning if we don't do something to stem the tide.   <br /> <br />Flight Capital chronicles the personal accounts of a numerous professionals who have left this country for the lands of their birth.  Country by county he cites a litany of sterling entrepreneurs and technology wizards that find the grass is greener back home.  We read about people such as China born, New Jersey educated Wu Ying who returned to his homeland to launch his own company that now generates over $2 billion a year in revenues producing mobile phones.   <br /> <br />So where exactly did we go wrong?  Why are the Wu Yings of this world leaving the land of milk and honey? <br /> <br />To begin with, as Walter Wriston might say, human capital that once flowed freely into the USA is staying where it is better treated.  As up and coming nations such as India, China, Ireland, Singapore and Israel develop their own Silicon Valleys and offer a better standard of living, it's only natural that homeboys and homegirls come back to the fold.    <br /> <br />The post 9/11 environment in this country has also contributed to the brain drain.  Hassles over H1B visas, angst over outsourcing and a sometimes nativist, anti-immigrant backlash have all conspired to shut the door on highly qualified foreigners.  The giant sucking sound created by their departure unfortunately leaves our country bereft of engineers, physicists, chemists, mathematicians and other scientists-the very core of our technological infrastructure.  To make matters worse, the U.S. is simply not producing enough of these individuals to take the places of the foreign born talent. <br /> <br />Although the author says, \\"Flight Capital is intended to sound a loud wake-up call to a nation often blinded by hubris\\", he claims it's not a forecast of certain doom.  Corrective actions are possible and he offers twelve specific points that can ameliorate the brain drain. <br /> <br />For those concerned about America's ongoing brain drain, this is a must read. <br />	2005-10-10

It truly is a coming of age tale of the March sisters & their unbreakable bond through all of the tough times that life places before us.  <br /> <br />In my opinion, this book was very relateable with situations that many of us as readers have encountered. For me, it was very nice to see such a close-knit family who loves each other so much, as opposed to the broken family homes turning up in novels so often today. (And don't get me wrong, I know how important it is to portray the 'broken' homes too-I come from one myself.)Another reason why I loved this book was because of the warm & endearing bond that the March sisters shared. I never had a sister & having the chance to peek into such a relationship between  these sisters was very much so enjoyable for me. <br /> <br />This novel is well-written & has obviously withstood the test of time for it is just as well-loved now as it was five, ten, or twenty years ago! <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

He works almost eighty hours a week as a surgeon and an ER doctor at his hospital. He does this to make ends meet, having to pay child support for his twins (a boy and a girl), whom he adores and alimony to their mother and his ex-wife, Maxine. Despite this drain on his time and finances, Will manages to support his pet projects, a mission style soup kitchen for the poor and homeless called the Open Hearth Kitchen and The Hippocrates Society, a collection of various medical practitioners who have banded together the counter the creeping influence of the dreaded heath management organizations.<br /><br />All in all, Will, who is widely respected in his field and admired for his sensitivity for his patient's welfare, has a pretty normal and uneventful life. That is until he is cajoled into representing the Society, as a last minute replacement, in a scheduled debate with Boyd Halliday, the CEO of a large and growing HMO, Excelsis Health Care. From then on his life seems to unravel. First he meets an attractive plain clothes police officer, Patty Moriarity, who is investigating a series of homicides of CEOs of three HMOs believed to be the work of a disgruntled patient or relative. At first Moriarity is attracted to Will but after she checks up on him she thinks he may possibly be involved in the murders. Then the killer calls him on his private number, congratulating Will on his skill in the debate. Then the ceiling caves in when he passes out, literally head first, into the patient's newly opened incision during surgery.<br /><br />Will wakes up in intensive care and everybody is very cool to him. When his Doctor, an old friend, comes in, he tells Will that he tested positive for a massive dose of Fantanyl, an extremely dangerous and addictive drug. Will of course, is incredulous but he and nobody else can think of how it could have been administered to him. He knows he didn't do it but it seems all his co-workers and most of his friends have made up their mind, in fact his medical license is suspended and he's banned from the hospital.<br /><br />As the story continues Will becomes the murder suspect for the serial killings, though he's never charged. He has become entangled in the web of intrigue surrounding the murders and he and Moriarity wind up fighting for their very lives.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I have read four or five novels by Michael Palmer and have enjoyed each one. The Society was not the best one but it was a very good medical thriller that had me flipping them pages. Palmer's writing style is very smooth, with just a touch of humor. He does a good job of writing his novels without going into Doctor speak but occasionally he does go into his physician mode, whereas I have a little trouble understanding but this is minimal and I simply nod my head and go on.<br /><br />The story was well written and flowed well. There was always something happening in this fast moving, fast reading novel, which made it impossible for the story to become boring. Palmer developed the characters well and you really empathized with the protagonist, Will Grant. There were several antagonists of varying degrees to dilike as well. One was Detective Brasco, an obvious chauvinist, who was in charge of the investigation, who was full of himself but couldn't seem to get out of his way. At one point approaching the end of the book Moriarity saves his life and almost gets killed herself. That was the last we heard of Brasco and I would liked to have seen some sort of resolution between he and Moriarity but it was not to be.<br /><br />If you like medical thrillers then this is right up your alley.

Eric Ashworth, creative chemist, with a touch of entrepreneurial genius and a craving for exotic drugs, awakens in an L.A. jail, badly burned, thinking he's in Hell. He has amnesia. Poor guy can only remember the name \\"Desiree,\\" but cannot recollect who or what the moniker is attached to. His knack for remembering past experiences is so shot, in fact, that the first cop he speaks with has to tell him his own name.<br /><br />Eric's learned memory is also effected. He is able to recall some chemical formulas, the concept of profit and loss, and still possesses a minor ability to devise better ways to zone people out through the wonders of modern chemistry. However, he had been \\"unique\\" before the lab explosion, and the overdose that erased eight seconds worth of his gray matter. Ashworth is \\"irreplaceable\\" to those who hired him. He had possessed brilliance - the ability, perhaps, to cure diseases like cancer. Instead he chose to design and produce recreational drugs. Discovered and backed by big bucks from an underworld honcho, Eric and his multitude of skills went to work, producing and distributing drugs. He received, and still does, dire threats from a toady thug and his retarded, violent son as to what they will do to him if he blows the job - literally and figuratively.<br /><br />There is an image that occasionally flashes across his mind. \\"A ball of fire, half the size of the house itself rose to the sky. Beautiful.\\" \\"Between the flash and the roar, there wasn't any space at all.\\"<br /><br />Ashworth's lawyer, whom he doesn't remember meeting, bails him out of the clink and takes him to a low rent dive, Hotel Firebird, Room 621, where his neighbors are pimps, whores, buyers, sellers, and lots of bugs. I gather from the psychedelic narrative that the bugs are both the creepy crawly kind that bite, (occasionally painted in day-glo colors - or viewed through day-glo colored retinas), and also the kind people wear taped to their bodies - \\"tapeworms.\\" Eric samples a mysterious new drug called \\"Skin,\\" \\"Cradle,\\" or \\"Derma\\" that synthesizes the sensations of touch, and allows him to time-travel inside his skull for weeks. Due to Skin, or the slow, inevitable return of his memory, or both, he begins to recall his life as a clandestine criminal chemist and his relationship with Desiree, his fortune telling lover. Perhaps he would have been better-off to have remained an amnesiac.<br /><br />Craig Clevenger can sure write!! I have highlighted and book-marked phrases and paragraphs throughout the novel to go back and reread. I may not have understood as much about our protagonist as I would have liked, or empathized with him a whole lot at times, but the author's heavily stylized, wired prose is exceptional - no doubt about it! I will say that the parts of the narrative dealing with Ashworth's childhood, his parents and his fear of violent storms is brilliant and very sensitively handled. Other characters are introduced here: fellow residents of Hotel Firebird, Jack and the Beanstalk, their friend Donna, Detective Ainslinger, Manhattan White and his sicko son, even Desiree - but they all just move on by. I'm in Eric's head and everyone else is a blur.<br /><br />As for the storyline, the reader is carried along on sheer manic energy, at times moving with the beat and allowing meaning to rush past - like some terrific 60's acid rock song - or trip. (My age is showing!). I am glad Mr. Clevenger kept the page number at 212. I couldn't have run with him much farther. But it was a really good trip.<br /><br />I am reminded here of Will Christopher Baer's \\"Kiss Me Judas.\\" Although I like the character of ex-cop Phineas Poe more than Eric Ashworth, I am sure if the two ever met, they'd get along very well. I bet their respective creators would also.<br /><br />I have not read \\"The Contortionist's Handbook\\" but plan on doing so soon. Craig Clevenger is extremely talented and I hope his new novel does as well as it should, based on merit! Kudos!<br />JANA	2005-10-10

It's a beautiful story that lets you be a child but walks you to the next level.  I think shouldn't be missed in childhood and should be revisited in adulthood.  There's love, loayalty and the joy of childhood fantasy (i.e. loquacious and literate animals) but so much else exists in this \\"children's novel.\\"  Recognizing the value of a life no matter how small, agreeably dealing with personalities and temperaments other than your own, new vocabulary written right into the story, growing up and putting away childish things, savoring the fact that life goes on and can be richer than you imagined...

It briefly touches on the lives of her parents, details her early life, and spends the bulk of the text talking about life as a model and the wild times had. This book does not skimp on details about Dickinson's sex life and it often takes a front seat. However, though it seems a bit trashy at times, sex was a huge part of Dickinson's life and resulted in a paternity mix-up with her daughter.<br /><br />Being a model in the 1970s was certainly exciting. It was during a time when sex, drugs, and Studio 54 reigned supreme. Dickinson's stories are grabbing and hard to turn away from, even though they could turn one's cheeks red.<br /><br />The many photographs might do the same if one is reading the book in a very public place. Many are nudes. However, they are artistically done; several are photos taken by Janice herself.<br /><br />This book is a must-have for fans of models. It also is sure to give insight into the personality of Janice Dickinson, who is often misread due to her fame from America's Next Top Model and The Surreal Life.	2005-10-10

Queen Eleanor, of Aquitaine, established St. Jude's Abbey. There, young women train in the knightly arts, as well as the martial arts from the East. In times of trouble, when hope is slim, Queen Eleanor calls upon these women to protect the royal family and England.<br /><br />Elspeth Braybrooke's weapon of choice is a staff. Queen Eleanor gives her the task of locating the \\"Llech-lafar\\". It is a legendary stone of Merlin's. Prophecy states that if the King steps upon the stone he will die. So Elspeth's quest is to find the stone and keep the prophecy from happening.<br /><br />(Welsh Prince) Tarran ap Llyr and his men are escorting an elderly woman, Vala, to Tyddewi when they see Elspeth hanging from a castle's narrow window. Tarran is surprised to learn that she is trying to get in, rather than out. Soon Tarran and his men come to respect Elspeth's fighting abilities and bits of wisdom. Tarran convinces Elspeth to accompany them and keep Vala company. Since they are going her way, and it is safer to travel with a group, she agrees. Yet she must not let herself be diverted from her important task by Tarran's touch.<br /><br />Tarran feels the same heat of attraction for Elspeth. Yet he, too, must not be diverted. Tarran is searching for the man who murdered his wife, Bradwr ap Glew. A man who was once Tarran's most trusted friend.<br /><br />**** This is the second book involving the strong women of St. Jude's Abbey. (The first is titled A KNIGHT LIKE NO OTHER.) I found myself so engrossed in this story that I did not realize I was learning so much about English history! The tale grabbed my attention from the beginning, then kept up a steady pace of action, plot, and romance until the very end. You will never find yourself growing bored while reading this book.

I bought a used book online and it's even better than I remembered.   <br /> <br />It's very much a pulp sci-fi (almost fantasy) adventure series.  This book is in the romance section because of her other books, but this truly is an action adventure story not a romance. <br /> <br />Ann Maxwell does a great job at writing compelling characters.  The fire dancer Rheba is exotic and exciting.  Her mentor Kirtn, the furry Bre'n, is an interesting and unexpected counterpoint.  Additional side characters are so interesting that I wish she had written whole books about them such as the mercenary fighters on planet Loo.  When I read the book as a kid, I didn't care for the young boy (I don't want to give too much away so I'll stop there), but now I have more empathy for his character.  Maxwell is just extremely creative. <br /> <br />Another strength to her writing is that she keeps the plot moving fast.  Every chapter ends with a cliffhanger or some other twist on the story.  This book is an easy, fun read with some sparkling creativity.       <br /> <br />On the downside, the main characters get a little too lucky a little too often toward the end.... there are some gaps in believability that allow the plot to keep moving at a lightning pace.  However, the book is so enjoyable that my only real complaint is that I wish she had written more books!	2005-10-10

Joseph Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict XVI, originally wrote this book in German, as the final volume in a series on Dogmatic Theology. It is a very professional piece of scholarship and is the culmination of twenty years worth of research.<br /><br />In this book, Ratzinger writes in a very clear and direct style, but as it is an academic piece, it does presuppose some background knowledge in Christian theology. The book begins by asking the questions, what do people think, and why do they think this. The beauty of this work is that it is an understandable but incredibly thorough study of the Judeo-Christian intellectual history for the topics of death and eternal life.<br /><br />The book begins with an overview of the perspectives in contemporary Biblical scholarship on the issues of death, judgment and an afterlife. It explains in very simple terms what the Bible says on these topics and how this has been interpreted in Christian history. How various questions associated with death were approached in the Old Testament, the New Testament and in the Tradition of the Church, right up to the present day.<br /><br />The final sections of the book make a close analysis of numerous questions of what was and is meant by Immortality, the Resurrection of the Dead, Final Judgment, Hell, Purgatory and Heaven. The book then finishes with an updated overview of contemporary approaches, written by then Cardinal Ratzinger on the occasion on the translation of this book into English in 1987.<br /><br />If you want to really understand what Christianity teaches about death and an afterlife and why this is so, this book is for you.	2005-10-10

Not because of his pioneer works in electronics, which were one of the foundations for the rise of the Silicon Valley companies and their technological progress and commercial success, but because of his views about the danger of declining cognitive capabilities in the United States. Convinced of the mainly hereditary origin of intelligence differences, Shockley saw a clear dysgenic trend in Western societies and publicly talked and wrote about the causes and possible remedies of this development. The most important of his articles about these topics can be found in \\"Shockley on Eugenics and Race\\". These essays demonstrate that Shockley wasn't motivated by racial oder elitist prejudices, but by certain facts and serious concern about the future of Western civilization. Shockley's articles with such provoking titles as \\"Society has a Moral Obligation to Diagnose Tragic Racial IQ Deficits\\" or \\" Has Intellectual Humanitarianism Gone Berserk?\\" are no scientific papers about cognitive psychology, behavioral genetics or the social implications of eugenics, but nevertheless interesting statements of a highly intelligent outsider in these fields, in a debate which isn't finished. The most interesting parts of the book are a lengthy \\"Preface\\" of the eminent psychologist Arthur R. Jensen, who thinks of W. B. Shockley as \\"a truly genius\\" (which doesn't mean that Jensen's \\"Preface\\" is an uncritical eulogy), the very informative \\"Introduction\\" of the editor Roger Pearson with many biographical details about Shockley and the political-ideological background of his activities, and finally, last but not least, the \\"Playboy\\"-Interview with Professor Shockley in August 1980. In that interview Shockley tells the reader for example - among other details of his biography (one of the most controversial themes: Shockley's famous participation in an elite sperm bank), his political and ideological opinions - that he himself was not tested as an extreme bright kid in the seminal longitudinal study of Stanford psychologist Lewis M. Terman -  the young Shockley did not belong to the Top One Percent of Californian school-children. This really strange result should be one of many reasons to remain cautious in matters of IQ and society, more cautious than the courageous electronic engineer and physicist Shockley was.elite sperm bank), his political and ideological opinions - that he himself was not tested as an extreme bright kid in the seminal longitudinal study of Stanford psychologist Lewis M.

Most political tomes are angry, depressing, and vicious attacks on their opponents. Franken provides a light, humorous and satirical alternative which allows us to laugh at conservatives, laugh at the self-deprecating Franken, and laugh at ourselves for (sometimes) accepting without question what conservative pundits propagate as truth. <br /> <br />All conservatives aren't bad or evil. But publicity and ratings obsessive conservatives can be. Franken offers several examples to point it out. <br /> <br />This book is an excellent look into the psyches of right-wing talk-show hosts, pundits and politicians. Even their most loyal followers would benefit from some of the funny insights Franken provides. If you think Limbaugh and Hannity are entertaining, then you will LOVE this book. Because, as Franken points out, they really ARE entertaining.  <br /> <br />Megadittoes, AL!!!! I think this book is WAAAYYYYY better than \\"Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot\\" (which I am reading now). Part of the reason is you take on the ultimate right wing propaganda artist, Hannity. Will Fox ever get a real leftist co-host who will actually DEBATE him??? Probably not. He has been known to whine that Franken lied about him. I'm not sure I can believe anything he says but even if Franken did lie about him, so what? Hannity has made lying and defending liars an art form.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Simply reading the book has been one of the best ways I have found to remember my dreams and to induce lucid dreaming.<br /><br />A reviewer noted that for some people reading the book is enough to create lucid dreams, and she is right.<br /><br />The book contains several accounts of people having a variety of experiences with dreams and dreaming, and these accounts alone make for a great reading experience.  Add to that scientific knowledge concerning the dreaming brain and mind, a variety of dreaming techniques that work, and an interesting model of how dreams come about, and you have a fascinating and useful book.<br /><br />The idea of schemas, proposed in the book, is interesting and informative.  Schemas are basically ways that information fits together in your mind based on your expectations and beliefs.  Your schemas will define what you dream about and how it is you dream about it.  The model of schemas tells us why our dreams tell us so much about ourselves in terms of what we really think and feel.  The model of schemas can also help you explain to yourself why you have certain dreams.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants to live more fully in that portion of their lives they spend asleep and dreaming.  The book helps to open up an entire realm of adventure.	2005-10-10

I was reading a copy in my chiropractor's office and really got hooked. I wanted my own copy so I could refer back to recipes, sources, and background reasoning.<br /><br />Dr. Rogers starts out by assuming she has to really (and I mean extensively) convince you and I that we are full of toxins. The air we breath, the food we eat it laced with them and our bodies defenses are tested every second of the day to rid them. Now, what happens when the body is fighting off not only toxins but internal biological threats (disease)?<br /><br />Her plan involves boosting your immune and detox systems (50% of which is in your gut), changing your oil (say no to trans fats), and detoxing (cocktail, enema, and FIR sauna). I had already made the change to a healthier diet (lots of organic fruits and veggies, less processed grains and foods, whole grains, less frozen) and exercise regimen, but there is one catch. Toxins bioaccumulate. If our body has no way to deal with trans fats, mercury, etc... it stores it in the fatty tissue. Those McD's fries I ate as a kid and teenager, that margarine that they said was better than butter, all those artificial sweeteners, years of air pollution ...  you get the idea. Once you reach a threshold for these toxins they start to imitate symptoms of chronic diseases.<br /><br />It was fascinating to really understand cancer, remission, the immune system, and the digestive systems.<br /><br />Bottom line: there are real cures out there for chronic illnesses. Drugs focus on controlling the symptoms, Dr Rogers focuses on the root cause. I feel she is very genuine in wanting to spread the truth. I found the book very informative (if a bit verbose and repetitious) and would recommend it to anyone that wants to understand what else they can do now to prevent issues in the future an enjoy a pain-free life in their golden years.	2005-10-10

I should have chosen a different book. I have completely finished reading it, but my notes are so scattered, that I have to do the editing for this author on my own. It's so poorly organized, and the information is not clarified. The author only presents information to be of interest, but doens't explain it.

I purchased this book (as well as Spring Cleaning and Clutter Control) to help prepare my new home for move-in.  What a lifesaver it was.  The home I moved into was completely renovated, so an overhaul was unnecessary (I highly recommend Spring Cleaning for that).  Speed Cleaning allowed me to go in and completely clean the home from ceiling to floor in no time at all.  The author is very honest about his system - it's his way or the highway.  I was okay with that, because I found he was able to more efficiently clean a home in less time than I had ever done.  It really works!  I did purchase some cleaning products from his online co., which I have found to be superior to anything found in the grocery store - and I love not having 20 different cleansers.

I did find the writing to be self-conscious in a distracting way:  we, as the readers, are so clearly meant to be taken on a journey led by the author.  In that way, I was annoyed by the book, because it seemed to be using the naive perspective of the lead character as almost a trick--hiding the ball from the reader.  Because of the perspective, the book is limited and cannot really speak to universal truths.  It is more like a parlor trick.  There is value in sharing the perspective of autism with the general population, and I don't mean to belittle that, but it's almost like this book wants to define autism for the reader and give pat insights into the experience of autism that can be used by the reader to feel like they have contained and comprehended what is certainly a complex and, in many ways, unfathomable condition.	2005-10-10

That is what I am and who I am and that is how I should be remembered. No happy lies, no invented memories, no fake sentimentality, no tears.\\"<br /><br />The above quotation from \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" perfectly describes both the author and the content of this book, which is the story of one man's journey down the road to recovery. Presented without sentimentality, limited punctuation and straightforward arrogance, it paints a vivid picture of bottom-of-the-barrel addiction. Reading it made me woozy. I felt both intoxicated and sick to my stomach. I felt his pain, agony, fear, hunger, Fury, irreverence, self-loathing and, most poignantly, his strength.<br /><br />If you know nothing about addiction, this will help you understand where and how it begins. As the author recounts his Family sessions at the clinic, you can BE the parent hearing terrible things your child admits to you--things you may have suspected, but never knew were happening. Some of us know alcoholics and addicts and know that the likely outcomes of this behavior are either prison or death. For the fortunate, there's rehab and for the few (the 17% who, according to the clinic counselors portrayed in this book, stay sober for a year after they leave) recovery. Bucking the system--refusing to accept God or a Higher Power, deriding the Twelve Steps, refusing advice on (nearly) everything with a youthful and odious irreverence, James Frey adds an entirely personal and educational dimension to the topic. He tries to make the reader understand that alcoholism/addiction is an equal-opportunity disease (although he may argue that it's not a disease) and recovery is completely up to the individual. In spite of his despicable nature, we root for him. We can't help but wish him and every character in this story well.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said.	2005-10-10

This book uses and explains the required background mathematics, with instructive diagrams shown throughout. The author also bothers to explain to the reader the \\"whys\\" of digital signal processing. For example, the book even takes the time to explain to the reader the reason that you would want to filter digitally in the first place. All of the basics are covered, including the discrete Fourier Transform, Finite and Infinite Impulse Response filters, the Fast Fourier Transform, and a unique chapter on digital signal processing tricks including data windowing tricks, frequency translation without multiplication, and real-time DC removal. Particularly helpful is that filter design methods are broken down algorithmically into numbered steps with the associated equations. Complete design examples of these methods are also shown to hammer home the concept. Throughout the book, the author assumes the audience is an engineer that, in the end, wants to use this information to build something useful, not to sit through one derivation after another.	2005-10-10

As other reviewers have suggested, it presents large and small ethical dilemmas for its protagonist to puzzle over. But in the end, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the protagonist's actions were as much motivated by revenge as by some kind of pure ethical principles, however much he might protest.<br /><br />Van Cassius Albert is from the Taran Republic and serves competently, if controversially, in its space navy. After he succeeds where he was supposed to fail, repeatedly disrupting his government's plans, he is retired from the service. When he is unable to find other work, he is rescued from mysterious assassins and winds up employed by Trystin Desoll, the near-immortal protagonist from \\"The Parafaith War.\\" It's obvious to everyone but our ethically striving but dense protagonist that he is being groomed by Desoll to take over, and that the Tarans as well as the religious, zealot Revenants are Bad Guys, if in different ways.<br /><br />You will have to decide for yourself if Desoll and Albert are ethical, or rationalizing fascists. Desoll, in \\"The Parafaith War,\\" at least attempted persuasion from within before taking the more . . . drastic . . . measures here. Albert doesn't. The Taran Empire brutally killed most of the people Albert had known. How much of Albert's actions are driven by a personal need for revenge? Was Hiroshima justified? These are not new questions.<br /><br />In some ways, this novel left the same sour taste in my mouth that Peter Hamilton's \\"Fallen Dragon\\" did: the conclusion is that selfishness and selfish choices can solve humanity's fundamental flaws. I think the Farkhans may share my opinion. You'll have to decide for yourself.<br /><br />Good but not great. As much annoying as throught-provoking. Bonus points for Albert's amazing family.	2005-10-10

The reader gets a mind's eyeful of down and dirty Glasgow, and a heroine bristling with raw, scrappy ambition, moral dilemmas, and the excruciating self-consciousness of youth.<br /><br />In 1981 Paddy Meehan, fresh out of school, an Irish Catholic from the tenements in sectarian Glasgow, lands an unrewarding job as a copyboy - a gofer - at the Scottish Daily News. She's mouthy and smart, but overweight and self-conscious about being female in a male profession. \\"The journalists had a lot of odd ideas about women: she was always having to stay late and lift heavy boxes to show that she could.\\"<br /><br />\\"Affecting reluctance like they all did when called to do any work,\\" Paddy is secretly pleased to be called on by the editor, \\"a skinny, agitated man,\\" who \\"lived on a diet of sugar and tea and whisky\\" whenever he needs a discreet job done. That he calls on her because she's green and uncoopted by loyalties is beside the point.<br /><br />The big story at the moment is a murdered child and Paddy notices small overlooked details even before she discovers her fianc&eacute;'s cousin is one of the two boys arrested for the crime. The boy comes from an impoverished alcoholic home and Paddy, in a moment of weakness, confides in Heather, an ambitious cub reporter. Heather exhorts her to write it up, but Paddy, mindful of her family, refuses.<br /><br />So her blood runs cold when she sees the whole sad, gossipy story in the paper the next morning. As expected, everyone turns a deaf ear to her explanation. Her fianc&eacute; refuses to see her, her family shuns her with silence, and Paddy knows things will never be quite the same.<br /><br />Angry and alone, she takes refuge in her ambitions and digs deeper and harder into the inconsistencies she's found in the police's tidy explanation of the boys' guilt. In her inquiries she uses Heather's name - Paddy's already been warned about posing as a reporter - with unforeseen and devastating consequences.<br /><br />Paddy's story is interrupted by odd diversions back to the 1960s when another Paddy Meehan, a coincidental namesake, was arrested for a murder he didn't commit. Except for its spur to her ambitions and her investigative streak (he was exonerated by a persistent journalist), his sad sack narrative has little to do with the main action.<br /><br />Mina's (\\"Garnethill,\\" \\"Deception\\") story is seamless in its relations of character to plot and setting. Left to herself, Paddy embraces the secrets she's kept: she has no religion and she doesn't want to be the wife her mother is. Paddy's ambitions and insecurities come out of her grim, close-knit, poverty-stricken background. Readers who like their crime thrillers dark and literary will look forward to another sojourn with smart, witty, clear-eyed Paddy Meehan.per and harder into the inconsistencies she's found in the police's tidy explanation of the boys' guilt.

Ellen Destry nabs a rapist with satisfaction, but drags her feet going home to her nagging husband; Scobie Sutton bores everyone silly with the joys of fatherhood, but his daughter has head lice again; young Pam Murphy can't seem to curb her spending or her ambition and boorish John Tankard lusts after her while despising her zeal for work.<br /><br />And the Meddler, a local busybody and inveterate letter writer, who has just discovered his hurtful nickname, decides to take his meddling a step further. Shifting viewpoints keep us a couple steps ahead of the cops as the murders pile up, but with the deft use of twists and red herrings Disher keeps his mysteries until the page-turning conclusion.<br /><br />Character drives these absorbing, darkish procedurals from an award-winning author whose success in Australia deserves to be echoed here.	2005-10-10

Let us be under no illusions about that. It is verbose, repetitive and massive in its scope: tackling virtually the entire gamut of issues that philosophy traditionally deals with. But by the time you have finished reading the book (it took me three months to finish)it would have transformed the way you live your life. You may not agree with Aurobindo, and in fact, he probably does not want you to blindly agree with him, he would much rather that you think things out for yourself; but one thing that he certainly does is to question the 'commonsense' view of the world: the view of the world that we build up using bits of unexamined,untested, received, 'truths'. Take just one such 'truth': We believe--or at least we have done so ever since Descartes--that Matter and Consciousness are two separate things. Aurobindo puts forward the suggestion that the two are actually one and the same entity, only they are in different states being: somewhat like Ice and Steam being different states of water. If we concede that matter may be a form of consciousness, only in an inert state, all sorts of consequences would follow: especially with regard to our attitudes towards the environment.  <br />As I had said earlier, the scope of the book is massive. Its three parts can be roughly divided into Ontology (where he discusses the Nature of the Cosmos), Epistemology (where he discusses the nature of Knowledge (&Ignorance), and the problem of Evil--which he attributes to Ignorance: a consequence of Ahamkara or ego-centricism) and finally, in the last part, he provides a broad, general direction for living our lives in accordance with our revised view of the world (Ethics). However, the book is not tightly structured (If you are looking for a book like Wittgenstein's Tractatus you will find yourself truly frustrated) it is loose, repetitive, and disjointed. Possibly because it was originally written as a series of essays and published monthly in a magazine called the Arya (between 1914 to 1919). He must have had to repeat himself because his original audience would have forgotten a point that he would have made five years ago. But the cumulative effect of the repetitions is that his ideas have a tendency to gradually seep in and sink into your mind, rather than strike you as a sort of brilliant epiphany.  <br />Aurobindo's philosphy is ultimately rooted in ancient Hindu Vedic thought. In the course of the book, Aurobindo tackles Marx, Darwin, Nietzche, Freud, Hegel, Feurbach, (plus a whole range of European philosophers) and his idea is to adapt their philosophy to the 'Truth' as expressed by the Seers of the ancient Vedas. Does he succeed in doing so? I don't know. That is for professional philosophers to decide. For me, the book has been a revelation, the scales have dropped from my eyes: I see things differently now. Hopefully, I will continue to do so for a while before the snares of living in a modern city finally engulf me once again. Haven't they said that we can't stand to face the truth for too long?	2005-10-10

Empiricism is seen in distinction from Rationalism, in that it doubts the viability of universal principles (rational or otherwise), and uses sense data as the basis of all knowledge - experience is the source of knowledge. Hume was a skeptic as well as empiricist, and had radical (for the time) atheist ideas that often got in the way of his professional advancement, but given his reliance on experience (and the kinds of experiences he had), his problem with much that was considered conventional was understandable.<br /><br />Hume's major work, 'A Treatise of Human Nature', was not well received intially - according to Hume, 'it fell dead-born from the press'. Hume reworked the first part of this work in a more popular way for this text, which has become a standard, and perhaps the best introduction to Empiricism.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the idea of empiricism is that experience teaches, and rules and understanding are derived from this. However, for Hume this wasn't sufficient. Just because billiard balls when striking always behave in a certain manner, or just because the sun always rose in the morning, there was no direct causal connection that could be automatically affirmed - we assume a necessary connection, but how can this be proved?<br /><br />Hume's ideas impact not only metaphysics, but also epistemology and psychology. Hume develops empiricism to a point that empiricism is practically unsupportable (and it is in this regard that Kant sees this text as a very important piece, and works toward his synthesis of Empiricism and Rationalism). For Hume, empirical thought requires skepticism, but leaves it unresolved as far as what one then needs to accept with regard to reason and understanding. According to scholar Eric Steinberg, 'A view that pervades nearly all of Hume's philosophical writings is that both ancient and modern philosophers have been guilty of optimistic and exaggerated claims for the power of human reason.'<br /><br />Some have seen Hume as presenting a fundamental mistrust of daily belief while recognising that we cannot escape from some sort of framework; others have seen Hume as working toward a more naturalist paradigm of human understanding. In fact, Hume is open to a number of different interpretations, and these different interpretations have been taken up by subsequent philosphers to develop areas of synthetic philosophical ideas, as well as further developments more directly out of Empiricism (such as Phenomenology).<br /><br />This is in fact a rather short book, a mere 100 pages or so in many editions. As a primer for understanding Hume, the British Empiricists (who include Hobbes, Locke, and Berkeley), as well as the major philosphical concerns of the eighteenth century, this is a great text with which to start.ic and exaggerated claims for the power of human reason.'  <br /> <br />Some have seen Hume as presenting a fundamental mistrust of daily belief while recognising that we cannot escape from some sort of framework; others have seen Hume as working toward a more naturalist paradigm of human understanding.

She is working hard at becoming an FBI profiler that her father would be proud of. She has returned to New York City in order to work with her mentor and fathers friend Agent Cain. She is not in the city long before she gets her first case. Men are being killed in heinous ways and there seems to be no connection...it's not long before Angie puts the clues together and finds out that to her shock that this case is going to hit much closer to home than she ever thought possible. What could a serial killing she was working on have to do with her father's death? Her only tether in this new emotional storm is detective Carson Servero. He's street smart, handsome, and willing to help her through her first case. He's attracted to her but can they mix business with pleasure...or better yet, should they?<br /><br />Again readers will be drawn into this dramatic and suspenseful read.

Obviously gun control is close to his heart and this book describes Kilcannon's efforts to institutionalize a modicum of safety measures in the face of the intractable SSA.<br /><br />The Plot<br /><br />After unraveling the president's plan to get gun manufacturer's to voluntarily provide locks for their handguns and require background checks on sales at gun shows, SSA president, Charles Dane goes on the offensive against the hated Kilcannon. As the Republican Parties main contributor, many members of the Senate and Congress are beholden to the SSA, so Dane meets with the Senate Majority leader, Frank Fasano, to go over strategy to neutralize his perceived enemy.<br /><br />The Story<br /><br />Shortly after taking office, President Kilcannon, a divorcee, marries his lady friend, the beautiful, former Lara Costello, previously a news correspondent. However, prior to the wedding, Lara, while in San Francisco, confronts her sister Joan, a victim of spousal abuse and forces her to talk to Kerry, who was a former prosecutor, specializing in spousal battery. After getting Joan to file a complaint against her husband, John Bowden, Police secure the gun from him that he had held to Joan's head a few days previous and he is arrested and subsequently released on bail, with the stipulation that he stay away from his wife and six year old daughter, Marie. But John is a troubled man.<br /><br />John Bowen, obtains passage to Las Vegas, where he attends a gun show purchasing a gun that has been banned in California, along with especially deadly bullets, from a private seller, at the gun show. Then he returns to California where he awaits the return of the Costello family from Washington DC, where the five Costello women had attended Kerry and Lara's wedding. At this point the stage it set for tragedy, leading, subsequently, to a round of Machiavellian intrigue, which would make Robespierre proud.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Balance of Power is a long complicated book of 605 pages. It is both heart wrenching and inspiring. During the inspiring parts, I'm not ashamed to admit my eyes would water. If you pick up this book you are in for an emotional rollercoaster.<br /><br />This book would not appeal to gun advocates, since it depicts the gun lobby as unalterably set against even the most modest safety measures, even those volunteered by gun manufacturers. The author, Richard North Patterson, conceded to a gun control bias in the Acknowledgment section at the rear of the book, although that was obvious to me, from the tenor of the novel. In truth the book mirrors the intransigence that often emanates from the real life NRA, regarding seemingly innocuous legislation, in total disregard of the victims and survivors of gun violence.<br /><br />In summary, Balance of Power is an excellent tale of the exercise and misuse of power in lobbying and government which can make one seethe. The character development is superb, with distinct conniving antagonists you love to hate, contrasting with good and admirable protagonists. The situations that unfold are extremely interesting, such as a conundrum which existed between a lawsuit needed to thwart pending legislation, whose passage would terminate the lawsuit.<br /><br />The book is well written and the writing is fluid. There is, in myopinion, some superfluous verbiage though not overly so. Patterson's writing style, although sometimes technical, is still easily understood. He is one of the better authors I have read. I did have a problem with one element of the story, where they were submitting legislation that would kill all product liability against all manufacturers, passage of which, would wipe out pending and future lawsuits by employees of a company that had received fatal doses of asbestos in a mine. That didn't seem like product liability to me. Still Balance of Power is a fascinating read, that gives the reader a glimpse of the inner workings of congress and special interest groups.

Memnock The Devil shows that Ann Rice is not \\"losing it\\"--she's LOST it in this 5th of the Vampire Chronicles.

This particular scene is pornographic voyeurism of the most twisted and sick/Sick/SICK sort but Rice goes ahead and describes it IN DETAIL--and it is here in the book that she sold herself to \\"prurient interest\\" became an author-to-avoid for me. <br />Read it if you must, but you're wasting your money to buy a copy at ANY price.	2005-10-10

However, it falls short on several counts. The route descriptions are rudementary at best. The lack of photos introduces severe abiguities that can lead novice climbers into trouble. Many of the route descriptions are out of date and need revision. A route described for a given peak may actually be more difficult than other known routes up the same peak (e.g. Mt. Morrison).  This book could easily be twice as thick with photos and more detailed route descriptions. I hope that the author significantly updates the text in future additions.

David Hume, a philosopher of the period often classified as British Empiricism, is the intellectual associate of philosophers John Locke and George Berkeley. Born in Edinburgh in 1711, he attended the University of Edinburgh but did not graduate. He went to France during his 20s, and spent time there working on what would become his most famous work, 'An Enquiry into Human Understanding', first published under the title 'Treatise of Human Nature'. However, Hume was a prolific writer, and dealt with many areas of philosophy, including politics and ethics, epistemology, and metaphysics. He wrote in the area of history as well, and had a politic career as British ambassador to France and a post as a minister in the government for a few years. His final work, 'Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion', was published posthumously in 1779, although work had begun on it as early as the 1750s.<br /><br />Hume was very concerned about rationality. Hume was never publicly and explicitly an atheist, but his rational mind, concerned about sensory and intelligible evidence, led him to question and doubt most major systems of religion, including the more general philosophical sense of religion and proofs of the existence of God. The primary arguments in his 'Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion' deal with the Argument from Design, and the Cosmological Argument. There is an assumed distinction here between natural religion and revealed religion, an especially important distinction in the Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment philosophical structure.<br /><br />- Natural Religion and Revealed Religion -<br /><br />Natural religion is the idea that we come to know and understand God (and, consequently, what God wants or expects of us, if anything) simply from nature and our sensory perceptions, as well as our interpretations (emotion and rational) of this kind of understanding. From very early in his writing career, Hume attacked the idea of natural religion and most of its conclusions, drawing a sharp line between what we can actually know and what ends up being fanciful extrapolations based on other-than-rational ideas and evidence. Revealed religion is primary what most religions base themselves upon - the burning bush to Moses, the resurrection and post-resurrection appearances to the Apostles, the Buddha's enlightenment under the tree - these are examples of revelation. While Hume does take on the idea of revealed religion in his other works, this particular text does not concern itself with that topic, and stays in the domain of addressing natural religion.<br /><br />- The Argument from Design -<br /><br />Arguments from Design have always had a strong appeal to believers within religious frameworks; they have often been used as tools of evangelism, as attempts to show that beyond the revealed doctrines, the very nature of things points to a creator. In very short order, the Argument from Design in Hume's newly-industrial time might have read like this:<br /><br />- Machines are designed by beings with intelligence.<br /><br />- The world and the universe it is in resembles a machine.<br /><br />- Therefore, the world must have been created by means of intelligent design.<br /><br />This is an argument by analogy, and is convincing to some, but often more convincing to those already inclined to believe in the existence of God.<br /><br />- The Cosmological Argument -<br /><br />The Cosmological Argument is at once both more subtle and more simple. The most simple way of stating it would be that God is the 'first cause' of everything. If everything has to have a cause (even the whole universe), then that first cause must be God. In the twentieth century era of thinking of a universe that began with a Big Bang, it seemed to some that the Cosmological Argument was confirmed.<br /><br />Hume would have been familiar with Leibniz's more subtle form of the Cosmological Argument, which argues for a world of infinite contingent causes. However, there has to be something outside of this system of infinite causes that produced the series - thus, even in a universe with no set beginning or ending, there would still need to be an overarching cause.<br /><br />- Hume's Arguments -<br /><br />Hume argues on many levels. His first criticism of the Argument from Design is that this analogy (as are most arguments from analogy) is faulty and not exact; we have no idea if the universe is like a machine. Even if it was, machines are often designed and built by several designers - why argue for one God rather than several? How do we know that matter and the universe don't have their own, internal self-organising principles?<br /><br />With regard to the Cosmological Argument, the argument is a little more strained. Hume argues that, in any series of causality, once one knows about each cause, it makes no sense to inquire beyond the sequence of causes to some other effect. This is a very Empirical argument, to be sure, and while perhaps not entirely satisfying, it still has merit in philosophy to this day.<br /><br />- Hume's Structure -<br /><br />This is a dialogue, set up in the classical way of people talking with each other about the subjects. Hume draws primarily from Cicero, whose work 'On the Nature of the Gods' uses characters of the same names. However, whereas Cicero was concerned about the nature of the Gods (their attributes, powers, etc.) and not their existence, it is the very existence of God that occupies Hume's thoughts.<br /><br />Hume, despite many years of work on this text, probably never quite thought it was finished. He left the work to Adam Smith (the noted economist, and friend of Hume in Edinburgh), who also thought the arguments against the existence of God were too strong, and likely too damaging to Hume's overall reputation. The tug-of-war over the publication makes for interesting reading in and of itself.<br /><br />These are important arguments, worthy of discussion and dialogue in philosophy classes, theology classes, and among others who ponder the existence of God.here has to be something outside of this system of infinite causes that produced the series - thus, even in a universe with no set beginning or ending, there would still need to be an overarching cause.  <br /> <br />- Hume's Arguments -  <br />Hume argues on many levels.

The straightforward, uncomplicated story was probably intended for children and certainly for young adults. Nevertheless, adults of all ages will find in it much to enjoy. The characterization of life in early Britain is quite convincing. Rome and the Senate are but a distant echo. Here we live the provincial life of a barely pacified country. A young Roman centurion recently injured in battle and so unable to serve in the legions, sets out to find the lost \\"eagle\\" (i.e. battle standard) of his father's legion. That legion, the Ninth Hispana, along with his father, had disappeared twelve years previously in Caledonia (the north of modern Scotland). In the course of many adventures the hero will learn of his father's fate. Interestingly, the book reminds me of the works of Rudyard Kipling dealing with the Indian subcontinent. Ironically, instead of English colonizers living among \\"noble savages\\", the shoe is on the other foot, and colonial Romans live among the barbarian tribes of Britain. Anyone with an inclination towards historical fiction will enjoy this moving adventure story. Commentators have pointed out that this is probably an apt description of how the British national identity was forged over the centuries.	2005-10-10

This review is of the short story \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon \\"The Legend of Sleep Hollow\\" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend.	2005-10-10

Paterson has again written a book about forgiveness and acceptance, which to me is the theme of many of her books.  I was hooked on this book early on and reminded a little of Bridge to Terabithia (a favorite) as well as The Great Gilly Hopkins.  Paterson's story may help readers understand life. For folks (old and young) who wonder if life is worth living, this book should help them figure it out. It's a great \\"read by one-self\\" or \\"read-to-others\\" book. The characters are very real and the situation quite plausible.  The trio of books (Gilly, Terabithia, and Stars) would make a fabulous author or theme study.	2005-10-10

This book does a great job of covering the basics of working with objects in PHP 5, but more important than that, it also teaches why we should use objects.  By combining theories of Pattern and Practice with the technical implementation details of object oriented programming, Zandstra has exceeded my expectations by offering a new way to look at solving many of the problems I often face as a web developer.  His well-seasoned advice draws from a sophisticated pool of experience, and covers a wide range of topics from Project Management to Design Strategy.

This book, more novella than novel, is the French text edition of \\"Double Indemnity\\", an intricately plotted, very quick read . Wholly plot-driven, the book is a classic morality tale. A seductive woman, Phyllis Nirdlinger, desires to kill her wealthy husband. An otherwise intelligent insurance agent, Walter Huff,  falls under her spell. Together they put together a seemingly failsafe plan to do the dastardly deed, making it appear as if it were an accident, so that the double indemnity clause in an insurance policy will kick into play. The problem is that all is not as it initially seems.<br /><br />Written as a first person narrative by the insurance agent, the writing is tight, spare, and lean. No word is wasted. Yet, the minimalism works to the advantage of the story, as it makes the intricacy of the plotting clear to the reader. Having seen the film with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in the lead roles, I kept hearing Fred MacMurray's voice in my head as I read the book. While the film deviates from the book in a number of ways, it is classic film noir at its best and well-worth viewing. Likewise, the book is a classic in its own right, and those who like hard-boiled crime fiction will not be disappointed.	2005-10-10

The book sets out to describe faith formation and education throughout a large scope of history and unless you have a specific time period in mind, this book may not be the most joyous of reads.  <br /> <br />If, however, you are researching a particular time and faith formation and education is pertinent to your study, this is a great tool to use.  Not only does it do a great job of stating the different arenas of faith, but it also gives a great historical context to put everything in perspective.   <br /> <br />Particularly, the piece on Premodern Judaism is wonderfully effective and allows the reader to be put in the context of these people.   <br /> <br />Overall, the book is well layed out and fairly accessible, but not a fast read.  This work does make a great addition to any course work you may be doing on spiritual education and faith formation and I recomend it even though it is very dense and includes some information that you really don't need.  It is worth the time reading it though.	2005-10-10

However, there are some new characters to be introduced as it is 20 years after that event Prince Arutha now has twin boys and this story follows them. This story is a departure from Feist's earlier books in this series as there is very little magic in it. In Prince of the Blood the main driving force of the book is politics and intrigue, it almost has the feel of a who-done-it type plot. Normally I don't like the who-done-it books but Feist was able to pull this off with a well developed setting, great characters, and a plot that seemed to always keep you guessing.<br /><br />The characters development in this is again very good, as can be expected with Feist. Since I have started reading Feist's books I have been rather impressed by how well thought-out his characters are. There seems to be very little that is done just for the sake of doing. Each character remains consistent throughout the story, and more impressively, throughout the series. This book centers on the development of two characters, those being the sons of the prince. Each faces different challenges and pitfalls along the way. Each is faced with a different set of circumstances that force them to make decisions. These decisions go a long way in there development. With all of the Feist books I have read thus far, he has a knack for letting his characters show flaws. They are not these all powerful people that some authors have as their characters. The characters in this book get hurt, have doubts, and one goes through a lot by the end of the book.<br /><br />At the start of this book I thought the plot was going to be rather straight forward and almost boring. Yet, the more I read the more complex the plot became. By the last 100 pages of this book the plot is so involved you are not even sure who to believe or at time exactly what even happened (or is going to happen). By the end of the book however, everything is brought to a nice close and it all makes sense. I think a great benefit for this plot is the setting which is richly described and used to its fullest to get the greatest effect.<br /><br />Feist is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors for his ability to weave a good story with good characters. It seems all too often most authors have one or the other and expect it to carry the book - while that can certainly be done - it's much more interesting when both elements are present. If you are a fan of the fantasy genre and have yet to read this book (or any other Feist books) you really should take the time and do so. Remember, to start at the beginning with Magician: Apprentice and follow it through. I think if one were to read this book first you may be a little confused, but not overly much so. All-in-all I highly recommend this. I think it's a must for any fan of the genreng is brought to a nice close and it all makes sense.

Books	5	36	41	N	N	A Gutsy Move	With so much emotional attachment to the identity of being \\"Celtic\\", it was a gutsy move to publish a book bringing the Celtic identity of Britain into question. However, despite this, it is always good to take a fresh look at evidence from a different angle, whether one agrees with the conclusions or not.<br /><br />James presents his argument against a unified \\"Celtic\\" people in the British Isles, and presents this argument well. He especially calls into question the theory of a mass migration of Celtic peoples from Europe, demonstrating that there is very little archaeological evidence for it, especially when compared to regions where such migrations are known to have happened. In fact, the archaeological record just does not square with the theory.<br /><br />Unlike some, I did not find James' book overly burdensome with the details of what James was trying to say and how he approached it. Being from a non-archaeological background, I found this information both helpful and interesting. Admittedly, if you are experienced in such matters, you might find it a bit boring.<br /><br />It seems that James treats the evidence available from the archaeological record reasonably fairly, and presents a reasonably plausible argument for his views. He covers a lot of territory in such a small book, and at times, I would have liked to get more detail on some aspects of it.<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed a book that dared rock the boat, and take a new look at the available evidence. In concluding that the identity of the British people as \\"Celtic\\" is an 18th century response due to political and social conditions of the time was a gutsy move, but one that needed to be made. James has hit a nerve, and some of the threats he has received are testament to that. A brave man, indeed!<br /><br />One note of caution: if you have absolutely no knowledge about Celts and theories of the Celtic identity of British people, I would suggest that you read a broader introduction. This book is not really an introduction to Celtic history in itself.to Celtic history in itself.	2005-10-10

While there are various other books on this subject, this book gives, probably, one of the best, and most elegant account on the theory, particularly multivariate distribution theory, which is commonly encountered in applications. This book gives a definitive account of the techniques used to derive multivariate distributions, starting from R.A. Fisher, P L Hsu's work [[ASIN:0387907254 Pao-Lu Hsu: Collected Papers]], to modern developments of A T James, and others. This book is a must-read for anyone who ventures into research in multivariate statistics.

Those of us in the Indiana Masonic community have long been informed and entertained  via articles he has had published in the Indiana Freemason and by his musings on Hiram's Forum, an internet discussion board that he moderates for the Grand Lodge of Indiana. The stars were surely in their proper alignment when the For Dummies publishers contacted Chris about writing this book. Freemasons For Dummies is a book that sorely needed to be written and Chris was the perfect choice to write it. I'm delighted not only for Chris, but also for our fraternity and the many thousands of new readers who will be exposed to his enormous talent as a result of reading this book.  <br /> <br />Pick any topic addressed in Freemasons For Dummies-Masonic history, philosophy, symbolism, ritual, et. al. A trip to your local library will reveal dozens of tomes on every aspect of Freemasonry and its appendant bodies. Open almost any of the books and you will discover  that much of it is written in language that in comparison would make the deed to your house read like a trash novel you might take along to the beach to pass the time while you catch a few rays. You will also find that there is no one book that adequately dissects all the basics of Freemasonry. The sad result is that there are a lot of Freemasons who know virtually nothing about the history of their ancient fraternity save what precious little they may have picked up in their lodgerooms over the years. Most non-Masons are either ignorant of Freemasonry altogether or awash in a sea of misconceptions and outright lies even if they have family members and friends who are Masons. <br /> <br />In Freemasons For Dummies, Chris Hodapp tells the fascinating story of Freemasonry using plain language and his unique wit to keep your attention, but don't let it fool you for a moment. This book was impeccably researched and Hodapp shows that he knows his stuff. Obviously, the format of the For Dummies series precludes the presentation of an exhaustive history and no one would purchase this book with the expectation of finding one. Hodapp has done a masterful job of condensing the history of Freemasonry into one chapter and he hits every mark as the story unfolds.  <br /> <br />As you progress through the book, you will be introduced to the philosophy of Freemasonry, Masonic symbolism, the inner workings of a lodge, and get a virtual peek into a lodgeroom while the degrees of Freemasonry are being conferred. Much of what has heretofore been considered secret is revealed to the reader while the real secrets of Freemasonry remain unscathed. You will learn about several of the appendant bodies of Freemasonry such as the York Rite (including the Knights Templar), Scottish Rite (32nd degree Masons), and The Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (better known as that fun-loving group, the Shriners), and many more. Perhaps most importantly, you will see many of the popular conspiracy theories, half-truths, and lies bandied about by anti-Masons systematically debunked. <br /> <br />If all that isn't enough, in Chapter 14, Hodapp climbs up on his soapbox and delivers some spot-on social commentary that addresses the relevance of Freemasonry in the 21st Century. I promise you it is the equal of anything you will read anywhere in any publication. This chapter alone justifies the price of the book. It is here that Hodapp really shines and displays the eloquence that I believe will ultimately transform him from the new kid on the block to a place among the elite of Masonic writers. Chapter 15 confronts head-on many of the issues modern Freemasonry is faced with as it tries to carve out its niche in today's society and will be of particular interest to Freemasons.  <br /> <br />Freemasons For Dummies is a primer for Masons new and old as well as for prospective Masons. It merits a place on the bookshelf of every Mason no matter how well-read he might be. As master of my lodge, I intend to make it required reading for all of our new initiates. For those non-Masons who just want to learn more about that group of men known as the Freemasons, this book is without equal. Nowhere else will you find a more concise, easy to read, or informative treatise on the subject of Freemasonry. Chris Hodapp has written with intelligence, style, and a sense of humor that successfully demystifies Freemasonry and makes Freemasons For Dummies an easy read.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Either they're gung-ho on Truth or they're gung-ho on Grace. What was wrong with the religious Jews of Jesus' day? Either they were gung-ho on Truth (the Pharisees) or they were gung-ho on Grace (the Sadducees). But John 1:14,17 says that Jesus Christ was full of Grace AND Truth. You can't have one without the other and be like Christ.<br /><br />Randy Alcorn does a masterful job at fleshing out what is probably the biggest problem with the church today - why we're not more like Jesus - and he does so with the smallest number of words (only 92 pages) in the smallest amount of space (only 6.5\\" x 4.75\\" size book). It doesn't take long to read, but there's enough meat there to meditate on for an entire year, and to spend the rest of your life trying to master.<br /><br />But it's really pretty simple: Grace + Truth = Christ-like love. If it's so simple, how come we keep missing it? Using examples from scripture, his own ministry, and popular as well as church culture, Randy examines this question and helps us come up with an answer that works. My favorite part of the book is his discussion of the song \\"Amazing Grace\\" - where it came from (a former slave trader) and the impact it's had on countless lives (especially blacks).<br /><br />This book will have an impact on your life as well. It's small enough not to intimidate yet loaded enough to satisfy even the most voracious spiritual appetite. Plus, it's inexpensive enough to make a perfect gift. This is one book that ought to be on every Christian's bookshelf, and its message needs to be in every Christian heart.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith	2005-10-10

His Lady Mistress starts off slow. It wasn't a real intense book but it was very enjoyable. I loved Verity. She had a very hard life. Her father took his life.  Max helps her (she was only 15 at the time) Max thinks Verity will be talking care by her uncle. So he leaves her.<br /><br />When the story picks up again. 5 years later Max comes to check up on her. He's told Verity killed herself by her uncle. He sees what he thinks is a servant being abused by the son. Max comes to her recue. I don't want to go into to much detail but Max asks Verity mistress. Then he finds out she is her friends daughter and thinks he's been trick into marriage. He demands she marry him and then the story truely begins. Max can be the rudest most crude man and then other times he is the sweetest man ever. You learn way Max is the way he is near the end of the book and truely understand him and like him. Verity is bright, capable, compassionate, strong and very womanly. She is a woman to admire. The love scenes are ample & steamy, and the plot is a fair one. From page one the characters in this book reached out and grabbed me. This book had its good moments and some flashes of good writing, but I kept thinking, while I was reading it, how much better it could have been. The characters had a lot going for them, but the plot & its resolution just didn't jell into a really good read.<br /><br />His Lady Mistress is a formula romance but as far as formula romance this one is really pretty good.	2005-10-10

The book was this one which not only entertained but also informed (and infuriated by the reaction of the faithful to what most would call overwhelming evidence). Both media draw the same conclusion: Not a shred of evidence exists for the history described in the BOM.  Whether the criterion for measurement is human DNA, linguistics, architecture or anthropology, there is no similarity to ancient Hebrews.  Native Americans are related to Asians (DNA, dental structure, language, architecture, myths) who crossed circa 30,000 years ago when the continents were joined. The similarity of the two groups is obvious at even a casual glance. Scientists have found campfires 750,000 years old yet not one object or bone from the enormous civilization described in the BOM  despite decades of extensive searching.    Accepting the BOM means accepting the story of its origins:  God, Jesus and angels visit Smith (he gives conflicting stories) and lead him to buried gold tablets.  he looks into a hat and translates &#34;neo-Egyptian&#34; into King James English (though the king lived 1,000 years after the tablets were written).  LOL The original BOM is grammatically a circus:  &#34;I was afeared of him&#34;.  &#34;Adieu&#34; (lol)    Smith also wrote the infamous Book of Abraham from &#34;real&#34; papyri that, when tested, was the wrong date and had nothing to do with Abraham. The LDS is appropriately silent on this episode.   But none of this nonsense changes anything.  It is difficult to leave an organization that one is taught is the arbiter of truth, whether it is Marxism, Catholicism or Mormonism, the one &#34;true&#34; church. The LDS is a profoundly American invention, constantly adjusting to changing social situations with convenient &#34;revelations&#34; from God that contradict previous revelations.  Slowly, they are replacing Smith with a new movement of happy campers dedicated to the church and its growth .	2005-10-10

Vidal is able to use Burr's assistant, Charles Schuyler, as the chief storyteller, allowing the narrative to skip around through time. Vidal likes to have the narrator tell the reader that the past \\"isn't like it is now,\\" which he would not be able to do if the story followed a strict chronological series. Characters are given incredible depth as they all have their dark faults to go with their heroic strengths. Vidal takes shots at the big guys. Some shots are substantial (like saying Washington was a poor leader who never lead the Army into a victory and only won the War because of France) and some are petty (Washington repeatedly viewed as having a \\"big butt\\" and often referred to as \\"waddling\\"). Jefferson is especially scrutinized. Besides the ubiquitous presence of light-skinned slaves insinuated to be of the Jefferson line, Jefferson is portrayed as a cold, calculating \\"philosopher king\\" who uses the constitution when it supports his causes, but calls for \\"states rights\\" when the constitution contradicts him.<br /><br />Aaron Burr, who despite all the nasty politicking going on around him, is portrayed as a gentleman who is constantly antagonized by his peers for trying to do the right thing. How he obtains so much power in the state of New York is not really pursued except to say he is a war hero. Also, Tammany is often mentioned in the background, but Burr's involvement is not pursued. However, Burr is always described as having control of the New York constituencies that he can influence when making deals with the Virginia \\"junta.\\"<br /><br />My only negative critique is I find it hard to believe that Burr was vilified by conspirators without having character flaws that might have contributed to his rise and fall.  Burr is always the benevolent gentleman while the other power mongers of the day (Washington, Jefferson, and Hamilton) are self-aggrandizing double-crossers without conscience. Vidal freely flings the mud at other historical heroes, but seems a little too defensive and paranoid about the reputation of Aaron Burr. Still, the book is rich with historical vignettes of Burr's meetings with various patriotic heroes. Vidal writes with enough veneration to let you know the characters are great and enough vindication to make them real.(Washington, Jefferson, and Hamilton) are self-aggrandizing double-crossers without conscience.

Our last-name devoided protagonist David stupidly makes a date for a girl named Angela on the same day and time as his grandmother's birthday. Then, instead of calling Angela to reschedule (something that I'm sure she would have gone along with), he came up with the brilliant plan of making a clone of himself using a device that he found on the beach.<br /><br />The character motivations weren't very clear. If this boy is in high school, then why is he still so stupid? He deserved every single bad thing that happened to him in this book, plus some that didn't. I usually enjoy William Sleator's protagonists such as Marco from Marco's Millions and the one from Interstellar Pig whose name escapes at the moment. This one had a disturbing combination of stupidity, selfishness, and thoughtlessness that made me cheer when a cement block almost took him out.<br /><br />Anyway, after creating the duplicate, he became offended when he realized that the duplicate wasn't a servile, creeping little thing. Apparently, he expected it to skulk around saying things like, \\"yes masther and no masther\\". The duplicate acted exactly like him, and for that, David acted extremely touchy and depressed.<br /><br />David also went out of his way to shoot down every suggestion the Duplicate (let's call him 'A') said. For some reason, he wants A to stay out of sight yet doesn't want him to hide. He then jumps on every possible opportunity to blame A for attempted murder, conspiracy to commit murder, rape, the extinction of the dodo, and global warming (okay, I made the last two up, but it seriously gets annoying to read through it since the narrative doesn't seem to realize how unlikeable this makes David seem).<br /><br />David and his duplicate make increasingly irrational decisions based on little or no thought. I emphasize again how weak their motivations were. Their blundering stupidity leads to a less-than-joyous ending (that I felt they deserved), and it left me with a cold feeling inside.<br /><br />I won't deny that I felt robbed by this book. I felt as if each and every dime I spent on this book had been ripped from my beating heart. I know Mr. Sleator can do better than this terribly generic title. His Interstellar Pig was classic. Compared to that, The Duplicate was just...forgettable.	2005-10-10

Chapman ran a software company heavily involved with government contracts. Not only did Ruiz do security work for Chapman, but he also had an affair with her before she unceremoniously dumped him. Ruiz has a ready-made motive of revenge and jealousy. <br /> <br />The book started out promising, but quickly turned disappointing. The whole middle of the story just dragged until I found myself starting to skim...not a good sign. I've never really enjoyed government corruption stories.

The book starts out interesting enough, with Susie Salmon narrating the tale of her murder and watching over her family (and others left on earth) from heaven. But, it loses momentum quickly due to poor character development. I read all 300+ pages of this book - and fairly quickly at that, but I just could not empathize or rejoice with the members of Susie's family as they moved through their lives.     The plot concept had great potential, with lots of room to delve into the emotions of a family dealing with senseless tragedy in its immediacy and over the course of their lives. However, the author did not make me care about the characters filling most of the pages; she did not tap into the emotional and psychological potential that could have been achieved with this premise.     For me, it was a huge disappointment. I simply do not understand all the rave reviews and the bestseller status of this book. In fact, I disliked it so much in the face of such praise that I felt compelled to write this, my first review on Amazon.	2005-10-10

I feel like I'm cheating the writer by giving it only four stars, because this book's great strength is its biggest flaw: It's a very good read. This is a broad outline of West Virginia history with some of the more important events colored in a bit. It's a bit over 200 pages and reads a like a novel. <br /> <br />I wish this had been the text we used in West Virginia history class back in junior high in the instead of that dreadful, trivia-laden textbook. <br /> <br />It's divided into chapters named after some of West Virginia places where major events in state history took place, (Point Pleasant, Harpers Ferry, Droop Mountain, Tug Fork, Paint Creek, Hawks Nest, Buffalo Creek) but the chapters cover far more in geography and time than the events that made the places famous. The Droop Mountain chapter, for instance covers not only that battle, but most of the Civil War and statehood period. <br /> <br />So it's not all-inclusive (Jim Comstock tried to do that with his West Virginia encyclopedia), but that's what makes it a pleasure to read and not a chore. One night when I couldn't sleep I picked up Williams' book and started in the middle, in the Paint Creek chapter. I was more than 30 pages into the book and into the next chapter before I could sleep. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Younger Readers (Awards))	Books	5	23	23	N	N	Tiger tiger burning bright, in the forest of the night	Before reading, \\"Tiger On a Tree\\", I hadn't really considered the American lack of children's books from India.  I mean, if you stopped the average bloke on the street and asked him to name a British children's book, you'd probably get some kind of an answer.  Probably Harry Potter.  If you asked for an Australian children's book you'd have more difficulties but at least 1 out of 100 people might know of one.  But ask someone to name an Indian children's book and all you're gonna get is blank stares.  Unless you ask someone Indian, of course.  Then you might learn something.  And what you might learn is just how great Anushka Ravishankar's, \\"Tiger On a Tree\\" is.  With very simple words, a story that's interesting while still remaining pretty darn basic, and some wildly original illustrations, \\"Tiger On a Tree\\" is bound to garner itself some enthusastic preschool fans.  Especially if they've a yen for tigers.<br /><br />In this tale, an almost perpetually amused large cat is on a kind of journey.  It goes down to a shore, crosses a river, scares an animal, and climbs a tall tree.  One of the local fisherman sees the tiger perched and shouts the alarm.  Soon all the men in the village have gathered to discuss the treed feline.  They set up a net around the perimeter of the tree and the tiger (no longer looking amused at its own adventures) is scared out of the branches by a cacophony of loud instruments, and straight into the trap.  Catching a tiger is one thing.  Figuring out what to do with him next is another entirely.  The men come up with some interesting ideas (one of the most interesting being to, \\"Paint him an electric blue\\").  Finally, however, they figure the best thing is to let him go.  The final picture shows the now once again elated kitty bounding on the opposite shore, away from the river's banks.<br /><br />The other day, I had someone ask (I'm a children's librarian) if I could recommend some rhyming picture books that were similar to the kinds of simple words used by Dr. Seuss.  Now, no one beats the Seuss.  He sort of invented the whole idea of simple words making fun books.  And while I was able to find plenty of simple books, few rhymed all the way through.  Should I ever receive this request again, I'm going to pluck \\"Tiger On a Tree\\" from my shelves immediately.  The words in this book never get much longer than \\"rubbish\\" and are perfect for children just beginning to read.  Words are presented in a black easy-to-distinguish font, large on each page (making them ideal for children with sight impediments as well).  The illustrations are an entirely different matter altogether.  Unfortunately, the publication page doesn't say how illustrator Pulak Biswas created the book's images.  In some ways, they resemble woodcuts.  In other ways, they look like broad black brushstrokes.  The only color in the book is an occasional shock of orange.  Whether the orange of the net to catch the tiger, the orange of the tiger's stripes, or the orange of the sun above, Biswas's palette is used sparingly and well.<br /><br />If I had my way, library's bookshelves would be filled with picture books from as many countries as possible.

She moved to New York to follow her dreams, but returned to her hometown of Briarwood, giving up that dream and instead of designing dresses, she made wedding dresses from existing patterns. However, there was one dress that it was rumored she still worked on. No one is allowed to see it, but every wishful bride would love to be the one to buy it and wear it on her wedding day. <br /> <br />Sylvie won't talk about her past and why she left New York, and it's a very sensitive subject for her. Instead of confronting her past, she buries herself in her many jobs - Dog groomer and boarder, wedding dressmaker, and other part time jobs that keep her busy day and night. <br /> <br />As the book opens, Sylvie sees that there are neighbors moving into the home next door, the house that once belonged to family friend Iva Whittaker who had passed away. Sylvie's current home, by the way, happened to have belonged once to her grandparents, the Shea's, and the Shea's and the Whittaker's were family friends from way back. Everyone in town thought the Whittaker house had been willed to a nephew, but looking at the man that was moving into the vacated house, Sylvie did not recognize him at all and was shocked to hear that the so-called nephew had sold the house to a total stranger. <br /> <br />Joel Mercer is a single dad, with a lovable six-year old daughter Rianne. While Joel comes across as grouchy and cantankerous, Rianne looks like she is looking for a new friend, and when her cat is treed by Sylvie's temporary boarder Oscar the dog, Sylvie and Rianne meet, and they soon become friends. Sylvie becomes an honorary member of the Shea family, making friends with Sylvie's niece and even calling Sylvie's mother \\"Grandmother Nan\\". Joel, in the meantime, finds himself attracted to Sylvie, but Sylvie is totally unaware of his feelings. <br /> <br />There is a lot of sadness inside Sylvie, but she hides her feelings behind her work, giving everyone the impression that she is a woman who is strong and independent. But deep down, she longs for the life that her sisters have - both are happily married, with one in the family way. Sylvie works lovingly on her wedding dress, never expecting to wear it. But with the Shea women constantly looking to set Sylvie up on blind dates, it is highly unlikely that Sylvie will remain single for very long... <br /> <br />I enjoyed this small town love story by Roz Denny Fox. This type of romance I always find endearing, and the ending scene of THE SECRET WEDDING DRESS pretty much put the icing on the cake for me. This is a love story for those who enjoy old-fashioned romances and happy sweet endings. Recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

Although Celendenin tries to stay neutral, numerous \\"defensive\\" references to Calvin's doctrines expose him as a devout Presbyterian. This will, no doubt, appeal to many Protestant readers who would rather read a pro-West, \\"on-the-surface\\" book about Orthodoxy without getting deep into the core of the Orthodox theological beliefs.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers mentioned that this book offers good insight into the history of the ancient Church and the Church Fathers. However, most of this history is a short paraphrase of Timothy Ware's \\"The Orthodox Church\\" with some of Celendenin's commentary thrown in. So if you hunger for deep exposition of Orthodox history, look elsewhere. Timothy Ware's \\"The Orthodox Church\\" would be a much better introduction. Although a bit dry at times, it offers an objective overview of The Church without throwing stones at other Christian denominations.<br /><br />One of my biggest problems with the book, and I know I am biased, is that often it seems that Celendenin presents Orthodoxy as just another church. Living in the West, I am certain it is easy to do. Considering that out of 600 million Protestants in the West, there are close to 30 thousand denominations all claiming that their way of faith is the right one, Orthodox claims of being THE Church of Christ on earth are dismissed by Celendenin with much irony. Moreover, I was not pleased with Celendenin's attitude towards clergy in the Orthodox Church in America (OCA), 70% of whom are Protestant converts. Although Celendenin does not do this explicitly, his tone portrays these clergy as gullible romantics enamoured with Eastern exotica.<br /><br />Overall, this can be a decent book for someone interested in a brief glimpse at Eastern Orthodoxy. Being just over 100 pages, it should prove a quick read for anyone willing to learn about superficial differences between Western Protestants and Eastern Orthodox.Western Protestants and Eastern Orthodox.	2005-10-10

There were some beautiful scenes and imagery in the book, and while once in a while it bordered on the pretentious, it didn't feel at all contrived, it felt genuine.

It was a quiet book that didn't bludgeon you with its messages but let them emerge with subtlety-everything happens within a day's time, which is quite an achievement because it gives you a real sense of a more substantial passage of time spent with these three women, whose inner lives are fascinating.

In the prologue, Mia and her best friend Lenore are told by a psychic that Mia will marry, within the year, a man whose name begins with a 'D' and ends with a 'K' sound - she thought Derek was that man. When Mia meets Dominic on the plane, she realizes that he may actually be the one the psychic predicted she would wed.\\"  Complete review at BookLoons dot com - M Lofton. <br /> <br />These are not great books, but for a quick beach read, these books do the trick.

I don't like much science fiction anymore, but this was a fun, easy read.  It is also funny.  The premise itself:  telephones rain from the sky, the caller on the other end offers nothing less than miracles. <br /> <br />At this point I would give the book 3 stars and move on (Sci-Fi has to be *really* good for me to give it 4 stars, almost nothing gets my 5).  However, I am also a history buff, and I really enjoyed a subtext I'm not sure everyone will get.  In 1905 the Russian Baltic fleet sailed around the world to engage the Japanese who had surprise attacked them at Port Arthur, now in China.  Passing through the North Sea the Russians sank a bunch of british fishing boats they mistook for Japanese torpedo boats, almost triggering a war with Britain.  After months of travel, the fleet arrived in Chinese waters and was promptly obliterated by the Japanese fleet in a battle lasting only hours. <br /> <br />Much of the story of \\"Singularity Sky\\" is a re-telling of the above story, in an only mildly more farcical way.  I enjoyed the inside references, and that bumped the book up to 4 stars for me.	2005-10-10

I agree with another reviewer, which states that the book is a repeat chapter after chapter.

And not even that \\"super head\\" she gave got any one of those celebs to cash out like I'm sure the book sales are doing.  She created a major hype for her self, surrounding the book and its memoirs.  She says she kept a journal of all the events following up to the release of her tell all...so when you really think about it, she was in it for the money all along.  I know a lot of video chicks are slapping their self across the head like \\"dam, why didn't I think of that.\\"  (LOL)  But in all I found it to be an okay read, every event was the exact same, except with a different sex partner, every chapter.  I've heard her radio interviews, read her magazine interviews, and also saw her little flick with Mr. Marcus...She's giving the media what the public loves.. \\"Controversy\\".

It is certainly the funniest book I have ever read.  Good Omens gives a unique perspective on the conflict between Heaven and Hell, the interactions between the underlings of each, and the place of humanity in between.  The movie Dogma is comparable, though I feel Good Omens is funnier and a little less irritating in presentation.  Not that I didn't like Dogma.  If you like one you will probably like the other.    Good Omens follows the not-so-evil Anti-Christ as he is misplaced at birth and raised normally in rural England.  He and his friends somewhat parallel the Four Riders of the Apocolypse, who have been living on earth and causing trouble for humans since the beginning of time.  My favorite characters however, are an incompetent angel and demon who are friends with each other.  They like humans, have problems with the beaurocracies of Heaven and Hell, and would prefer that the apocolypse never happen so that they won't have to go home.    The characters are all interesting and humorous, demon, angel, human, or otherwise.  The stroyline is good, and avoids falling into the 'same old thing' of apocolypse stories.	2005-10-10

And in foreign policy, exploiting the weaker nations for cheap labor and ownership of natural resources.<br /><br />Republican Bush II cut off almost 1 million families from unemployment insurance benefits, leaving 8 million in 2003 both unemployed and in debt, unable to find jobs, without health and child care. 43.6 billion without health care. In 2002, 34.6 million, 1 in 6, were earning below the poverty level with denial of welfare from bureaucracy, while Rep Bush spends over 30 million in program for \\"healthier marriage education.\\" Dem Clinton abolished the federal main welfare program to help the poor, removing 54 billion in over 6 years for those who earn less than 7 dollars an hour. Under Clinton there was a back lash against gays in the military and affirmative action, regression of gay sexual relations as a crime and the 2 millionth prisoner incarceration of U.S. citizens, mostly minorities.<br /><br />In the U.S., the small super rich own 1 percent earned what 40 percent earn annually and exploitation in foreign policy, Bush's Iraq never turned back into \\"normal,\\" with continual death, poverty and destruction, while the years of Clinton's sanctions and bombings have killed an untold number of innocent men, women and children, making not much of a difference between Democrats and Republicans, as the U.S. has had a hand in almost every foreign war and civil war, employing both military and economic imperialism, a system of exploitation, as in McDonalds and now Wall Mart, the IMF, WTO, controlling loans and aid, outsourcing cheap labor, misery and suffering, all for the profit of the wealthy and privileged few.<br /><br />And so the Socialistic solution is that for free universal education and health care, the end of the ownership of companies by the minority wealthy class to that of equalitarian of democratic (not limited representative) which are not run by elaborate bureaucracies and the means for profit driven motives. The end of over production, layoffs and wasteful spending to increase profit for the owners denying the underpaid proletariat, government run from the bottom-up. Each ordinary person having a democratic voice and partially held responsibility. \\"To each according to their ability, to each according to their need.\\" The critics who claim no incentive, all refusing to work or take on the menial easy to do jobs, fail to recognize the human drive in passion to work in a field that truly interests them, while equalitarian economically, awarded with various honors and prestige.<br /><br />How can we create socialism within this capitalistic system, if our so-called democracy is based on electoral votes designed to keep third  and leftist (all other) political parties out of the race? This along with the voting fraud of the 2000 presidential election. The entire process of both the Democrats and the Republicans are run by wealthy and corporate campaign donations buying tax breaks and deregulation's - \\"corporate welfare.\\"  This is because it costs millions of dollars to run for the Senate, the House and the presidency - Only 5% donations are from the unions, while 75% are from the wealthy and large corporation. So the politician, both Dems and Reps, needing votes, must then commit fraud and lie to the people as their representative, while catering to the wealthy. This is capitalism.<br /><br />Both parties in capitalism are corrupt in favor of the rich, as its not just the fanatic Right Wing Bush, as Clinton the Democrat broke a string of promises failing to: end gay discrimination in the military, to grant asylum to Haitians in Guantanamo Bay, to stop scabs crossing strikers picket lines and to bring health care reform. Instead he expanding the death penalty, prisons and police power and eliminate most of the welfare for the poor. With all this, the labor parties supported him because he was a Democrat - an illusion that Dems are for the people which came from Roosevelt's New Deal, which real reason was to prevent a possible socialistic revolution, a concession from people's pressure and still keep the wealthy protected capitalism. The same can be said in Kennedy's and Johnson's Civil Rights amendments; only from the pressure of the working person's protests. To vote Dem or the lesser evil principle is not a real choice! Both parties have shifted to Right. And the judicial system is not an election from the people or popular vote. Reforms are not from the White House but those voices in the streets, the factories and the work places. Capitalism cannot be reformed, it is always designed to protect the rich and ruling class. No president has the power to go against the demands of the large Corps, who threaten to take their money out of the U.S., removing their obligation to pay taxes. And when foreign governments turn socialistic and equalitarian, the mighty U.S. comes in and destroys them either, set up coos and doctoral regimes to protect U.S. wealthy and corporate economic interests, all under the false disguise of democracy. And while reforms are beneficial and are supported by socialists, they recognize it is only by revolution, by force, that this injustice of wealth, poverty, inequality, imperialism, consumerism, lack of health care, aid and homelessness can this be changed.ith all this, the labor parties supported him because he was a Democrat - an illusion that Dems are for the people which came from Roosevelt's New Deal, which real reason was to prevent a possible socialistic revolution, a concession from people's pressure and still keep the wealthy protected capitalism.

I got that and a lot more! I started reading various stories, not in order and I found out that this collection is full of Black protagonists. I didn't know the others but I was aware of the book, but having a collection like this is rare, all truly moving and touching...except...the structural errors that occurred throughout all the stories, there were strange indents, strange comma uses, it was quite hard to read. I just noticed these things, they didn't hinder the story or ruin the stories in anyway, just made them a little difficult to read. I don't know if it was part of the story or just poorly edited, its one of those things I think people should be aware of.  <br />On brighter note, this is a very highly entertaining, mind-opening and touching collection of stories, I truly must buy for all those short story enthusiasts!	2005-10-10

I have skimmed (not read) ALL of the Sano Ichiro novels.<br /><br />Assassin's Touch is typical: I can enjoy the first 20 pages, enjoying the characters and the period atmosphere. But then the unconvincing plot is introduced and I see where it's going to go all hooey. So I jump to the last 30 pages to read through the breathless chase/fight/showdown scene, and get to the happy ending. Not even a hint of curiosity to go back and read to fill in the narrative middle.<br /><br />I love medieval samurai period stories but these are just too painful to fully immerse myself in. The characters are shallow and this makes the plots unconvincing. It's just not convincing after reading novels like Shogun. These characters have no \\"smarts\\" and are like little automatons with little automaton motivations. It's like watching Ricky and Lucy (from I Love Lucy) trying to play lead roles in War and Peace.<br /><br />On the other hand, I may be taking things too seriously here. If you like short sentences and flowery, over the top simplification and dramatics, and lead characters having ridiculous near-death experiences and hostage situations, then these books might be of interest.<br /><br />Rowland has done well with this series and I will still skim each book that comes out. What can I say, I'm hooked on samurai.	2005-10-10

One of the actors in that movement was lawyers.<br /><br />Because they were not necessarily on welfare themselves, they had various motives for helping the welfare rights movement. Some people truly were empathetic to the cause; other people were going through the motions of their work. There also was a gendered component because the 'heads of households' on welfare were women and the lawyers (in an era when law school quotas were active) were predominantely men. How could they possibly empathize with the personal life experiences of their clients even if 'public aid' lawyers did not have to worry where their next meal was comming from?<br /><br />However, this book emphasizes that all lawyers reconfigured the 'welfare recipient'. From factors including their involvement she was an assertive-aggressive being who was demanding her rights publicly, This was far cry from the depression era woman intentionally positioned by society as meek and subservient, grateful for whatever assistance she did receive.<br /><br />Eight years after 'welfare reform', this book was an important read. It provides critical insight for readers interested in public policy and human services. It is also important reading for anybody needing to understand how the motives of a policy advocate ultimately do shape a public policy.	2005-10-10

Now to the story itself. You will find no really literary prose here, the storyline and what happens to the characters is the really interesting stuff. I couldn't say I like Karl, he was too moody, conservative, neurotic, and flawed. Bertha was too wild for him, and with bad qualities of her own. They just weren't a good match. They would have soon split up if it wasn't for Bertha's unexpected pregnancy. So they had to follow the moral social mores of the time and marry. But not even the birth of their son brings them closer together, so Bertha's lonely life seeks comfort, and she rekindles an old schoolgirl friendship with Christine. This leads to a web of really bad manipulation and lies with Karl as the target. This story of two calculating women bent on a campaign of self-destruction and greed will shake you. The last chapter was tragic, wonderfully tragic.	2005-10-10

At first, I worried that the beautiful book cover would turn out to be just so much eye candy, with nothing to back it up; I was wrong!<br /><br />This story ties together much of the folklore of Christmas, and, most important to me, not only does not omit the Nativity, but accentuates its importance, without coming across as overly-pious or preachy.  The eternal struggle between good and evil is well defined here.  The crass commercialism of \\"Santa Claus\\" seems even more offensive after reading KRINGLE, and I consider that a Good Thing.<br /><br />Another bonus about this book is, boys can enjoy it as well as girls.

Montaigne was a humanist and a skeptic in his philosophical approach, and essentially looked at his own experience as the first topic for examination always.<br /><br />The book of Essays was one he worked on periodically throughout his life, issuing different editions, the first of which appeared in 1580. Montaigne's style of writing is sometimes stream-of-consciousness, sometimes structured in more formal styles.<br /><br />Montaigne's stated task in his preface to the reader is for self-examination, but it becomes very clear that Montaigne sees himself as an 'everyman' character. He strives for full-disclosure; indeed, he writes that were he another culture 'which are said to live still in the sweet freedom of nature's first laws', then he might have appeared naked.<br /><br />This is a complete set of the Essays, together with a helpful introduction and notes for reading. As Montaigne added to his essays periodically, they are not necessarily in the order he wrote them, but this collection has preserved their order according to his standards.<br /><br />Montaigne's essays show a pessimism and skepticism, perhaps based on the kinds of conflicts between Catholics and Protestants going on, in France and elsewhere, as well as the periodic flare of plague. He was a humanist who saw cultures as having value internal to themselves and preferred to not universalise morals, laws and other ideas.<br /><br />Montaigne was sometimes conventional in thought (seeing marriage as necessary for children, and distrusting the idea of romantic love), but other times he was very much a free thinker (particularly when it came to religious dogma or absolutist kinds of philosophical paradigms). Montaigne had respect for those who followed religious codes and ways of life, but distrusted those who tried to impose such ideas upon others.<br /><br />Montaigne added to his essays twice in major ways, but did not strive for consistency or systematic ways of thinking - he declined to remove previous essays if they contradicted new writings.<br /><br />Montaigne is perhaps the most important French philosopher prior to the Enlightenment. His essays remain popular because they have a sense of the modern and the current about them.ied to impose such ideas upon others.  <br /> <br />Montaigne added to his essays twice in major ways, but did not strive for consistency or systematic ways of thinking - he declined to remove previous essays if they contradicted new writings.  <br /> <br />Montaigne is perhaps the most important French philosopher prior to the Enlightenment.

It communicates all of the basics that are required. <br /> <br />I've attended one of this consulting group's manufacturing classes.  I found them to be dead on.  I like the way they handled the accounting/cost/metric relationship to lean production.  Basically, the current accounting standards will cause you to do things in opposition to what lean principles will have you do. <br /> <br />In some other office scenarios, I think this more traditional approach will not have all the pieces or tools required.  I work in an industry where order entry is significantly more complex than the examples presented, a much higher degree of interaction with other players is required, and rework loops are significant part of the process (customer driven rework).  ANITECH has an approach that tracks the information flow surrounding the work process, while applying the same lean techniques that are presented in this book.   <br /> <br />Tracking the information flow provides an opportunity to sort out, automate, and lean out that information flow.  There is tremendous leverage in this concept.	2005-10-10

I recommend this book for parents raising a family with \\"high expectations\\" of their children.  One does not need to be a Kennedy to feel the pressure and isolation that often goes with the unspoken demand to perform.  The goal is commendable, but without continuous dialogue with the adults in their lives, very difficult for a young person to obtain. No wonder kids put in this position, seeming to \\"have it all\\", find themselves lost, lonely and confused, turn to drugs to ease the pain. <br /> <br />My hope is to get a message out, not just all the running with the Pack and the glamour, but the story of parental responsibility for the development of their beautiful children.  <br />	2005-10-10

I picked up Thomas Elias's book with a skeptical mindset and came away utterly convinced that Dr. Burzynski is the real thing: a dedicated scientist and researcher who has discovered a powerful nontoxic therapy for cancer.   Instead of honors and awards for saving lives, a status that is just now, finally, accruing to him, the doctor attracted animosity and worse from vested interests in the cancer \\"industry.\\"   His offices were raided, and he was threatened with imprisonment.   As Elias clearly describes in his beautifully rendered style, years of persecution became decades.   Meanwhile, there was one group solidly behind Dr. Burzynski: his   patients!   These were people who had been given up on by conventional medicine --men, women and especially young children, with aggressive, often end-stage brain tumors and other cancers. Dr. Burzynski treated them with his antineoplastons, they lived, in most cases even thrived, and, shockingly, their doctors had one word to say: \\"Remission.\\"    <br /> <br />Over and over again, this same denial by doctors cropped up, as people were told that what they could plainly see, feel and touch was not reality. But how could anyone deny obvious long-term remissions, cures, and good quality of life people experienced from Dr. Burzynski's medicine, as Elias faithfully reported! <br /> <br />After I read this book the first time, I went to the patient website that Elias described, [...] Now I know why these past and present patients, or patient family members, adore this man and will do anything to keep him out of harm's way. He has saved their lives! Someday he may be called upon to save yours.   If that time comes, I hope you will have read this book. Bravo Tom Elias! And bravo to Dr. Burzynski, for his remarkable work.  <br /> <br />Slowly but surely (and this gives me hope for a cancer-free world, someday) the rest of the cancer establishment is catching up with this intrepid pioneer. <br /> <br />If I or anyone I care about would ever develop any form of cancer, God forbid, I can tell you that I will be on an airplane to Dr. Burzynski's clinic in Houston the same day. I know what chemo and radiation do to the body. And now, thanks to Tom Elias, I also know there is an infinitely better, natural treatment where the cure will not kill you. This, to me, is comforting beyond belief. I have bought this book for everyone I know. If it is not in your library, shame on you. <br />  <br /> <br />Judy Katz, New York City, jkatzcreative@aol.com	2005-10-10

The English-speaking world has long been aware of Kierkegaard without being very familiar with his work and issues.  One might be surprised that Kierkegaard is not better known, since one of his primary focuses upon philosophy is that it begins and ends with the individual - in many ways, he is anti-Hegelian looking for a way of relating existence to the individual, and not to universals.<br /><br />Kierkegaard was very much a cynic, but still remained a faithful Christian all of his life, if not a faithful adherent to the institution of the church.  Kierkegaard was also a satirist and wit, and sometimes it is difficult to discern where that aspect ends and the serious philosophical work begins.  He is often considered the first of the Existentialists, but in many ways his work does not quite fit that category.<br /><br />This collection contains selections from the following major and minor works of Kierkegaard.<br /><br />* The Journals * Either/Or * Two Edifying Discourses * Fear and Trembling * Repetition * Philosophical Fragments * Stages on Life's Way * Concluding Unscientific Postscript * The Present Age * Edifying Discourses in Various Spirits * Works of Love * The Point of View for My Work as an Author * The Sickness Unto Death * Training in Christianity * Two Discourses at the Communion on Fridays * The Attack Upon Christendom * The Unchangeableness of God<br /><br />This collection is no mere collection of quotable-quotes or of key passages, but gives generous inclusion of major sections of the works.  Kierkegaard did not write in traditional academic or philosophical structure, so some of his writing is difficult to get through.  Part personal reflection, part polemic, part analysis, part literary creative flourish - all of these come together in a fascinating way.<br /><br />Kierkegaard deals with issues of estrangement and alienation, despair, universals and abstractions, individuality and subjectivity.  Kierkegaard sees the person as existing in three different levels - the aesthetic, the ethical and the religious.  These are inter-related but distinct in many ways; as they involve the breadth of human experience, Kierkegaard is no mere philosopher, but also a sociologist, a psychologist, a theologian, an historian, and much more.<br /><br />This is an excellent one-volume edition of Kierkegaard's work, from which one may gain much insight.  If coupled with the recent biography by Joakim Garff, it is a very handy reference for Kierkegaard's primary texts together with the insightful writing of Garff.th issues of estrangement and alienation, despair, universals and abstractions, individuality and subjectivity.

For this book he set out on a year-long journey across Canada and the United States, photographing prairies through the four seasons. The result is a magnificent document, illustrated with exceptional photographs, some of which will take your breath away. This is a threatened landscape, treated with love and passion. Page's written commentary provides a highly readable accompaniment to the photographs.<br />As Candace Savage writes in the Forward: \\"There is a fierceness in his work that I admire, and a fearlessness.  He has to be some kind of fool, perhaps a holy one, to be out there with his camera in the half-light of dawn, in the glare of lightning, in the bloodless glow of winter.  The wild prairie matters in these images.\\"<br />As a photographer myself, albeit an enthusiastic amateur, there are few photography books that I have been this impressed by, and I recommend it very highly.	2005-10-10

The main character, Mark Mason, brought to mind the spunky main characters in John Grisham's \\"The Client\\" and the title character in \\"Bud, Not Buddy\\". All three boys were clever, self-sufficient and suspicious enough to keep themselves safe and moving forward on their journeys.

Or rather, she throws together a serial killer novel and a police procedural.  It's really not her area of strength as a writer, and the resulting book lacks both the creepiness of a good serial killer book and the solid plotting that was the hallmark of some of her earlier books.  Killing off Helen Clyde was a serious mistake that will have long-term repercussions in this series.  By suggesting that the death is somehow Lynley's fault (because of his \\"hubris\\") she emasculates her hero; and will discover, in future books, that she has destroyed what kept readers coming back to her.  Whatever personal demons drove her to write this book, her editor should have shoved this one in a drawer.	2005-10-10

Well, according to me, that is.   Go ahead, hold your breath waiting for any of this to happen !!!    And gosh, if I'd read any of the posts here I'd know no one ever claimed Kerry's camera was \\"issued.\\"  I can't refute the fact that they were SOLD at the PXs in Vietnam, as most vets will tell you.  If I only knew any !!!!  And yes, it's true I AM the biggest moron of all the anti Kerry Morons (the 2 or 3 who are left) to think he'd bother to take films to use for political purposes, run in seven different campaigns, and NEVER use them !!!  And then when he did use them - after 35 years - only use about 30 seconds worth !!! And nary an \\"exploitation of alleged heroism\\" to be found !!!!  Huh ??????    Okay, wait, I'll figure this out.  See, he planned to run for President in 35 years.  So he took movies when he was in Vietnam, only for that reason.  He just forgot to put himself in very many of them.  Oops.  Oh well, anyway, then even though I think he ran on his military record a lot of times, he held on to those home movies, even in the close elections - even in the ones he lost !  - just on the chance he might run for President some day.  'Cause he'd never show 'em twice !!!  And then when he did run, he just decided not to use any movies that showed him doing anything \\"heroic\\" !!!!  Yeah, that's the ticket!!!    And if I'd actually read Unfit for Command, I'd know that no one is saying Kerry claimed to have spoken to President Nixon or Johnson in 1968.  Can't find it in any interviews or \\"documented\\" in the Boston Globe. As usual,  I'll probably keep insisting that he did, though.  But why be surprised at my blatant disregard for truth? Like O'Neill I think I can lie and get away with it.     It's certain that Shrub won't run for anything ever again (except maybe dog catcher)- his credibility has been destroyed. Don't confuse me with the truth huh?  But at least I admit that I continually repost.  I just get so confused when I post so many times under so many fake names.   But I guess it's not like you can't tell that I repost the same lame stuff over and over anyway.

I guess this makes sense in book one, but hopefully York will take a few more pages in book 2 and 3 to really develop Anok's companions. <br /> <br />Overall a good book, at least on par with the Kern series, if not better.  This book is better than a Forgotten Realms novel, yet still lacking something to take it into area of epic fantasy...the Kern novels suffer from this as well. There are several areas that the story seems \\"rushed\\"... and given the time frame the author had to write the book, that's understandable.  The romantic scenes are a little cheesy, but it is overall an entertaining read and a series worth picking up if you like Hyboria. <br />	2005-10-10

However, I do believe that most sensible Americans regard them for what they are--useless human beings who play pretend for a living.  Their opinions are of no value to anyone with an once of common sense.  Having said this, I do not believe that they are \\"screwing up\\" America anymore than President Bush or any of his nefarious cronies already have.  It's ironic that NONE of them are mentioned. <br /> <br />This book is clearly biased.  According to Mr. Goldberg, if you have any amount of fame and use it to vocalize your LEFTIST views, write for the New York Times, or work for CBS news, then you are screwing up America.  Granted, Mr. Goldberg DOES deviate from his hatred of liberals with the inclusion of ultra right-wing maniac Michael Savage, admitting that no one with such a foul, venom-spewing mouth should be permitted to continue to pollute the population.  And thank you for small favors. <br /> <br />Apparently, Mr. Goldberg has no room for opinions that are not conservative.  Given current events, it is clear that Mr. Goldberg's list should be revised.	2005-10-10

It's an unusual, hard to describe book - not quite a mere travelogue, but also a glimpse into the Ojibwe life, a survey of the land, a little about her family, and the efforts of a man to bring more books to the reservation. This effort continues today, and in LE's view is a vital endeavor. I totally agree.	2005-10-10

I bought this book on a whim, based on the lusciously gorgeous illustrations and the profoundly enticing writing - it fit the mood of the day perfectly.  Only two other artists have such a rich and delightfully wicked combined creativity; Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean, whose movie Mirrormask I had just seen!<br /><br />Brom has sewn together a magical tale that will send you longingly into the toy chest hoping to revive the life in those precious objects of youthful imagination.  Just as you wonder if there are doors in the backs of wardrobes or if the white rabbit could lead you off into Wonderland, Brom sheds new dark on the goings on in the Underbed. Perhaps one way of looking at this story is to say that the Nutcracker is sugarplum and cotton candy, Plucker is a perfectly decedent rich dark hand dipped imported chocolate truffle. If I could I would give this book a Newbery Award!<br /><br />I would have devoured this story as a child and as an adult did it in one day.  I would recommend it as a \\"read with\\" to those whose children liked Coriline (Neil Gaiman), Alice in Wonderland (Lewis Carroll), Keys to the Kingdom series (Garth Nix) and any good supernatural tale; basically a lover of Halloween.<br /><br />For adults it's a great read for fans of Ray Bradbury,  Hideyuki Kikuchi, Neil Gaiman, & early Stephan King.	2005-10-10

Written as a memoir + essay from his hospital bed in 1997, his narrator (who sounds very like Hell himself) is the old poet Paul Vaughn writing about his obsessive love affair with a young lad, fellow poet \\"T.\\" (Randell Terence Wode), a lad who migrated from the sticks of Kentucky to the wilds of beatnik New York and began a torrid sexual liaison with Paul, a bizarre symbiotic tryst that carried them across the Eastern seaboard in a drug and alcohol induced stupor. And if the story sounds familiar then that is part of Hell's success. The story updates and parallels the infamous gay relation ship between poet Paul Verlaine and the disturbingly brilliant youth Arthur Rimbaud, two of France's most influential poets who changed their medium dramatically.<br /><br />Others have used the Verlaine/Rimbaud biography to fine ends in film ('Total Eclipse' with Leonardo DiCaprio as Rimbaud and David Twelis as the older Verlaine) and in contemporary opera ('Season in Hell' by Harold Blumenfeld), but her Richard Hell not only pays homage to these great poets, he gives them contemporary words and poems and adventures that result in the most viscerally accurate vision of that duos' influence on poetry.<br /><br />Hell writes pithy, tart, smarmy prose, describing the physical meanderings of sexual liaisons while keeping his eye clearly focused on the poetic geneses those encounters initiated. While not all of the short novel is successful (there is a portion when Paul and T. are not the focus when the writing becomes a bit too self-indulgent - aimless writing for words' sakes), when Hell is on target the story is captivating.<br /><br />It helps considerably to have some background on Verlaine and Rimbaud's lives and works to appreciate the grit of this tale and taking the time to read some of the two poets' poetry will serve the reader well. But Hell's philosophical musings are excellent: \\"Those who die young don't know what they're missing! It's all worked out. The older one gets, the more one's drawn to the sky. And of course that's where one is heading. The sky of anti-admonition: a premonition. Not a threat but a promise. Heaven to flow in disintegration that way.\\"<br /><br />Richard Hell may not be in the realm of great authors, but is assuredly in the ranks of the challenging disrupters! He is worth paying attention to if you have questions as to the boundaries of literature!

Samantha Turner looks young, frail, and sweet. In truth she is ancient, strong, and extremely deadly. Samantha is a vampire. She wants to be mortal or at least pass for one. Since she moved into the neighborhood and opened The Artemis Shelter (a halfway house where women and children can heal and find a way out of abusive relationships), crime drastically reduced. The people that live in the area believe Samantha is, somehow, responsible for all their good fortunes. They don't know how right they are! Samantha only ventures outside during the day whenever the sun is weak. At night she patrols the neighborhood, going rooftop-to-rooftop, helping people and stopping crime. Then came a drive-by shooting. Samantha's speed let her save three of the children, even though she took two bullets herself. This could not be covered up. Others were dead in the street or wounded. Police and paramedics would come. Mortals who would ask questions that she dare not answer.  <br /> <br />Detective Peter Daly did not believe Ricardo's story. Ricardo claims to be the sole witness. But evidence points to Samantha being the witness instead. Why would they lie? What are they hiding?  <br /> <br />Samantha and Peter find themselves attracted to each other. Samantha knows she should get rid of Peter, yet she is drawn to him. Then her vampire friends begin disappearing.  <br /> <br />***** This series may be in the Silhouette line, but it is anything but normal. \\"THE CALLING\\" is a vampire series unlike any I have read. In 3/04 the series began with \\"Darkness Calls\\". Fans yelled for more. So in 6/05 \\"Danger Calls\\" was released. This story is the third in the series. Don't worry, each book can easily stand alone. You have no need to read the previous novels to fully understand and appreciate this one. Yet I recommend that you do so. Characters from earlier books show up to assist the new characters.  <br /> <br />Author Caridad Pieiro writes engrossing novels of the darker side of life. Sometimes I wonder if the author writes in blood, because the story simply oozes with realism. I often forget that vampires are not real. This is an outstanding tale that I highly recommend to all. *****  <br /> <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.	2005-10-10

Bush has taken abuse to a whole new level. Perhaps the most frightening symbol is the use of the Orwellian phrase, `Sound Science'. This innocuous sounding term is actually a euphemism for corporate friendly science meant to obfuscate and paralyze policy makers and the public. On this Republican's seem to have read straight from the playbook of Christian fundamentalists and their long battled against Evolution.<br /><br />Conservatives, like Bush, who enjoy viewing the world in black and white terms, see the cautious tone of science as timid and weak. The strength of science is its capacity for self correction and openness for debate on even the most established theories. There does, however, come a time when well established scientific theories reach a level of general consensus among scientist. In the case of Global Warming there is a strong scientific consensus around the world yet politicians would prefer to treat it as a he/said she/said affair so popular in journalism these days. As the author says, \\"[politicians seem to believe that] scientific truth is more likely to be found at the fringes of science than at the center\\".<br /><br />The goal of `Sound Science' is to exploit doubt, magnify uncertainty and raise the bar of scientific confirmation to an unattainable level. As long as corporations have millions to spend there will always be at least a handful of scientists willing to play for pay. No surprise that corporate financed studies whether they are for energy companies, tobacco companies or the food industry invariably find results favorable to their patrons. The problem comes when politicians with little to no scientific experience decide to give equal credence to corporate sponsored science and often give additional weight to the corporate side who also fill their coffers.<br /><br />The Bush administration has shown a complete distain for science in general, first by taking an unusually long period of time in making administration appointments to scientific positions and then by having the audacity to ask inappropriate questions during the vetting process including, `Did you vote for the president?'. As if things couldn't get any worse HHS released a memo informing government scientists that they must represent the U.S. \\"at all times and advocate policy\\". So if the administrations policy towards Global Warming is to express doubt government scientists are warned to tow the party line.<br /><br />Inevitably the new partisan approach to science by the Bush administration has lead to an erosion of faith in both the U.S. government and in science itself. Scientist will be seen as either government cronies or corporate shills. Author Chris Mooney also spends several chapters on fundamentalist Christian influence on science and how results are fudged for moralities sake. Bush has outdone all previous presidents in modern history in stacking scientific committees with like minded individuals sympathetic to administration policies. Distortions, censorship, group think and ideological purity.

Being a Struts developer himself, the author understands the topics very well. For exmaple, the MVC design pattern was explained well, and so were Struts Validation, HTML , Bean, and Logic libraries. Tiles is also covered well. However, there are some parts where he stumbled. For example, he could not be sure whether the Action class is part of the Model in the MVC pattern or part of the Controller. Therefore, I don't think you should get this book if you just first learn Struts (For tutorial, get \\"Struts in Action\\" (Manning) or, better still, the lesser known \\"Struts Design and Programming: A Tutorial\\") <br /> <br />Overall, this book deserves 4 stars, included in my wish list for next editions are EL and JSTL (for the View part in the MVC) and real-world examples.	2005-10-10

An intriguing drama about adjusting to suburban life and giving up the youthful days of partying gets lost in a subplot of cheesy horror.  But the scary part is:  Ellis was actually trying to be genuinely frightening.  And the horror was NOT scary, in fact it was completely ridiculous, and not even funny like it should have been.  If the book stuck to the story of fathers, sons and the need for love and family, I could have been open-minded enough to appreciate this new and more mature style of Ellis.  But it looks like he's losing his edge, and not to mention, his creative steam.  I still give it two stars just because he has such a unique way with words.  The words flow across the page beautifully.  It's unfortunate, however, that the story itself demands sympathy, and as with all of his other books, I just can't find it in myself to give it to his characters.  But unlike the rest of his books where satirical apathy is the key ingredient, this one takes itself a little too seriously for a plot containing demons resembling Cousin It and a homicidal stuffed animal.	2005-10-10

I was enthralled by it. It sneaks up on you, like a psychological novel, especially once you get through the introduction. There are some beautiful lines and scenes i don't think i'll ever forget. <br /> <br />The reason i decided to write this review is that the published reviews here suggest this is mostly about Saddam Hussein. It's far more multilayered than that. There's a whole separate story line of journal entries Salbi's mother writes to her as she is dying (and can't talk) that finally reveal secrets she kept from her daughter when she was small because Saddam \\"could read eyes.\\" It's a story about how people adapt to -- and become responsible for -- their own imprisonment. <br /> <br />I also learned about something you never read about -- real Iraqi people, secular Shiites, educated women most American women could easily identify with. I would recommend this to book groups and fiction-readers who loved the Kiterunner or, for different reasons, Secret Life of Bees or Alice Seybold. It raises so many universal questions about facing not only one's tormentor, but oneself, and finding the courage to start over.	2005-10-10

His style was unique.  I could almost hear him saying \\"Oh yeah?  Well let me tell you THIS story\\" and he would just break out into storytelling mode.  Reading CB's words was like sitting around a campfire swapping stories.  I was so sad when he had to take his blogsite down.  Every once in a while, we'd get a teaser.  Then finally.... THE BOOK! <br /> <br />I knew it was coming, and I knew it would be out in October, but man... to actually get the book and be able to read those stories again- priceless.  As a reader of his blog, I was happy to see that the old posts were there, as well as some biographical information and supplemental posts.  Have you ever read a story, fiction or non, and felt like you were being talked to by the author?  Reading \\"My War\\" is like attending a one-man Broadway show- a highly entertaining, conversational evening told first-person. <br /> <br />\\"My War\\" is not fiction.  It's a first-hand account of what leads young men to sign up for the military, and how war affects their lives.  It's about fighting for your life, and the lives of others in a foreign country.  The language is raw- so consider yourself warned if you are easily offended.  It's also not meant for someone looking to glorify war or someone looking for a disgruntled Reservist's criticisms about the war.  It's a talk with a war veteran.  Enjoy it.. open your eyes and ears, and learn from it.	2005-10-10

Hilarious, gripping, tantalizing, catastrophic, everything ellis has to offer.  I don't recommend reading part two of the book.  Sadly, the few loose ends part one generates are never wrapped up.  Instead, our hero gets suckered into some sort of bad espionage / terrorist novel with hints of David Lynch weirdness... and it truly just continues to fizzle out from there to a wholy unspectacular ending.  I had to read the ending like 3 times just to make sure I wasn't missing something, but there's nothing to be missed, it's just bad.  It's like ellis had a great idea... but it was too short, so he grafted on another idea, which sucked.  American Psycho still rules, though.	2005-10-10

This is a tale about two friends, Lennie, who is big and strong but suffers from a mental deficiency, and George, the guy who always gets Lennie out of trouble. George wishes he didn't have to deal with Lennie's persistent knack of getting them fired from their work, but on the other side he and Lennie had always been together since Lennie's aunt died. This is a nice short read for people looking for good writing. Steinbeck puts great detail into character development and attitude. The characters in this book I find all have their own unique qualities, even the minor characters. George and Lennie are a perfect example of a ragtag duo seeking work. I hope this book will impress you as much as it did me.	2005-10-10

I already owned Kuharski's book \\"Raising Catholic Children\\", and enjoyed it.  I bought this book expecting it to be really focused on prayer and how to include prayer in our lives as mothers of busy, full households.<br /><br />But really, this book was more of a \\"re-hash\\" of what was already in \\"Raising Catholic children\\".  It was more of a biography of the author and her 13 children [which is interesting, but I'd already read and didn't need to buy a second book to read about it again].  I didn't see much that was new or that was related specifically to prayer.<br /><br />So, while it is an entertaining book that you will probably enjoy if you haven't already read her earlier book, it doesn't really have any new content or much specifically about prayer.	2005-10-10

It was detailed, interesting, enlightening, and written exceptionally well. I especially loved how at the end of every chapter, the author made some witty remark. He was not afraid to tell the truth about our history and the acquisition of many western territories, even though it did not make the U.S. look very good. There are some shocking parallels between our foreign policy 150 years ago and our foreign policy today. We're still an expansionist nation looking for more power on the world stage.  One hundred and fifty years ago, we were invading the Mexican controlled territories of the current western U.S; now we've invaded the Middle Eastern countries of Afghanistan and Iraq. Before I read this book, California history was short, simple, and somewhat dull. Now my view of California history has been transformed. I recommend this book to anyone with even a minor interest in U.S.	2005-10-10

As one reviewer alluded to, when I read Dean Koontz, I don't really try to guess how it will end because important players could be anyone from aliens to ghosts to members of a secret government agency.  This is fine, but when I read Coben, I want good solid logic. This did NOT fit that description. This is the first Harlan Coben book I've read that left me saying - \\"You've got to be kidding\\". And, the characters weren't very likeable as far as I'm concerned. The lead female is strong, but that's about it.	2005-10-10

It is so basic that it doesn't even cover the language in enough depth to write scripts - well, OK, except the simplistic script included in the last section. And OK, it does list the commands available in Ant, but doesn't give a single syntax clue - the exercise of actually writing an Ant script is left to the reader. It will tell you, in a long poorly formatted paragraph that CAB creates Microsoft CAB files; but again, no clue as to how you would use it in a script. God help you if you want to use Ant with your source code control system!<br /><br />My guess is the formatting was done by a computer illiterate high school student - it is *that* poorly formatted.<br /><br />Imagine read-<br /><br />ing  page after<br /><br />page of poor<br /><br />documenta-<br /><br />tion this way.<br /><br />We *do* get a half page for 'notes' at the end of each chapter.... cripes, I'd hate to think this was a school textbook anywhere that is accredited!<br /><br />It goes on for pages and pages about installing Ant and Java (in the root of your C: drive, by the way). It covers how wonderful open source is, and how you can probably configure almost any modern IDE to use Ant - oh, again the exercise is left for the student. You also enjoy page after page of how to use NOTEPAD to create your very first Java program (again in the root of C: ) and then how to run these exciting programs. If you are THAT basic a programmer, start with something more easy to use - say Perl.<br /><br />I've found more Ant help on the web site and in the O'Reilly book on Ant (Ant: The Definitive Guide by Steven Holzner) than in any of this book.

For decades, as any student who sat in on an intro anthropology class will tell you, the reigning comparison stood between Homo sapiens and chimpanzees.  Thus these aggressive, territorial, and -- to anthropomorphize a bit -- brutal primates, with their hierarchical and male dominated social structure stood as the explanation for all of humankind's worst impulses.  Such analysis fit well into the several millennium old dichotomy between our \\"animal\\" (evil) and \\"human\\" (good) impulses.   <br /> <br />Through his fascinating and often amusing analysis of the bonobo, another primate with whom, like chimps, humans share 98.5% of genetics'.  Where the chimp is brutal the bonobo is peaceful.  Where chimps are territorial and hierarchical, the bonobos share and maintain a female dominate structure.  Where chimps jealously guard sexual privileges, bonobos mate, well like animals, sharing partners in all conceivable combinations (De Waal pays this great attention, suggesting that such \\"loose\\" sexual relationships prevent aggression).   <br /> <br />De Waal writes well, and offers an interesting thesis that in fact both sides of human nature may well come from our animal roots.  He even presents interesting evidence for empathy among bonobs and more startling still, the elusive notion of consciousness, that an individual can project themselves into an alien form, such as bonobos caring for birds.  All of this makes for a fun and thought provoking read. <br /> <br />De Waal falls short, however, in not going deep enough.  While he demonstrates evidence for the emotional hardiness of chimps vs. the far more delicate bonobo (during a bombing in WWII all a zoo's bonobos suffered heart attacks, while the chimps survived), but does not go far enough in examining the potential genetic basis of such behavior.  Also, while he does offer in bonobos interesting evidence of alternative survival strategies to aggression, he unfortunately empathizes a bit too much with these gentle creatures.  The resulting anthropomorphize, while forgivable, distracts the readers and leads De Waal to make some arguments that seem a bit forced and ignore viable alternatives. <br /> <br />Such criticism, however, should not cause any to shy away from this quite enjoyable and thought provoking work. <br />	2005-10-10

Heart of Darkness is however no such book.      Conrad cannot help himself but to create sentences which are comprised 90% of adjectives.  I must agree with Ryen Lapham's review - the content of the book is worthy of a short story alone - some 30 pages, but is stretched out over 100 and feels three times the size.    I was positively exhausted after reading this book.  The feeling was one of listening to someone with a strong accent whom I struggled to understand.  I found the constant streams of adjectives and lack of content placed me in a state of meditation and I often had to reread pages again and again because my mind was constantly wandering off.  Even then, on many occasion, I struggled to understand what was going on.      Conrad constantly jumps topics and within a few words he has moved from confronting Kurtz in the jungle to chugging off in his steam boat.  It is totally confusing - who is in the steam boat - where are all the natives - where is Kurtz (two words ago Conrad had mentioned him in his cabin).  The book is similar throughout.    Though he does challange many of the myths of Imprerialism of his time his view of the 'savages' is amazingly patronising and his constant referral to them as cannibals is not only wholly incorrect but insulting.  I felt at times Conrad's view of the blacks wasn't far off the derogatory views of those that he is attacking.    I must admit, after rushing to finish this novel (for the wrong reasons) my last words are too - \\"The horror! The horror!\\"	2005-10-10

As Hugh Fitzgerald has observed: Nadia Abu El-Haj, an Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Barnard, is listed among the members of the MEALAC faculty at Columbia. A graduate student at Duke University, she turned her doctoral thesis into a book: \\"Facts on the Ground: Archeological Practice and Territorial Self-Fashioning in Israeli Society.\\" One admiring reviewer (from the University of Chicago) said the book offers \\"an anthropology of colonialism and nationalism, which follows Foucault and Said\\" in which \\"she points to the convergence of archeology's project with that of colonialism.\\" Others have not been so kind. <br /> <br />For this book is not really about archeology at all. Rather it is a relentless attack on how and why Israelis, Jews really, have done archaeology in the land they have the audacity to call Israel. For the past, like the present, is merely a cruel and daring fiction foisted on the world at the expense of Palestinians, a social construction, as the orotund phrase has it. Ignoring or destroying whatever got in their way, Jewish archaeologists have been relentless in their pursuit of the Jewish past to claim the land and its history for modern Israel, and of course to dispossess Palestinians and their \\"claim\\" to the past. <br /> <br />But El-Haj, it seems, is not really an archeologist. There is not the slightest evidence that she has ever seen the work of Israeli archeologists, ever visited a dig, ever studied the history of the development of Israeli archeology, ever inquired as to how Israeli archeologists choose the sites they do choose for digs (do they get instructions from the Jewish Agency? The ZOA? The Mossad?). She appears not to have any record of the kinds of artifacts the Israeli archeologists, often working with Western, non-Israeli and non-Jewish colleagues, have discovered, catalogued, and meticulously studied.  <br /> <br />Shabby or pseudo or nonexistent scholarship disguises a naked political assault. Israel is guilty. Its crime: daring to dig, under the soil of Israel, on land where Jews lived from perhaps 1000 BCE until this very day. And built temples, and wrote on pottery and left scrolls on parchment, and fashioned menorahs, and cups for drinking, and dishes for eating - in short, a rich variety of artifacts for uses sacred and profane. But to demonstrate a connection between Jews past and Jews present is unacceptable, an abuse of archaeology, serving the cause of a \\"construct,\\" a Western imperial falsehood. That is, a Jewish state. <br /> <br />Is it surprising, is it illegitimate, is it deplorable, that once again having a restored Jewish state, that the Jews of Israel should not have dug into the earth, not attempted to study the past, including -and this must be emphasized for it is left entirely out of El-Haj's account- artifacts from every period, and not only artifacts of the Jewish past? Israeli archeologists have, often with foreign colleagues, discovered Roman coins and mosaic floors and temples, have uncovered Byzantine artifacts, and those of the Islamic conquest, both of the Arab period, and of the period of Ottoman rule. Many of the Islamic artifacts have, in fact, been meticulously and scrupulously catalogued, studied, and preserved -all serious students know about the Islamic Museum in Jerusalem and its exceptional collection. Does Nadia El-Haj seems to think that the study of the Jewish past by Israeli archeologists, observing the highest professional standards, known for their meticulousness, is an outrageous political act, an act of \\"Jewish settler-colonial nation state-building\\" (that phrase itself deserves analysis, for the hysterical confusion of its English). <br /> <br />El-Haj's political fulminations may attempt to hide behind the rhetoric of \\"scholarship.\\" Is there a single example of attempts by Israeli archeologists to either hide the past, or destroy the past, or to create a false past? If so, she has failed to mention it in her book -which, by the way, relies entirely on quite recent, English-language publications, as critical reviewers noted. And since she is a Palestinian nationalist, how does her charge sheet compare with the treatment toward ancient sites by the Palestinian Arabs and by the Arabs more generally? <br /> <br />As is well known, in Islam there has been an almost total indifference to the non-Islamic or pre-Islamic world. Many of the artifacts of that world have been destroyed over 1350 years of Muslim conquest and subjugation of Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, Hindus, Buddhists. In India, the Muslim conquerors destroyed as much of the Buddhist and Hindu heritage as they could, sometimes in order to quarry the stone, sometimes to destroy statuary. The Indian historian K.S. Lal has provided a meticulous list of tens of thousands of identified Hindu temples destroyed by the Muslim invaders, for example. The recent destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was not an aberration; those Buddhas were virtually the last remnants of the Greco-Buddhist civilization that Afghanistan had once possessed. <br /> <br />The systematic assault by the Palestinian Arabs on all sorts of significant sites, some of them regarded as holy, was on display again in 2002, when the systematic and complete destruction of Joseph's Tomb in Nablus (that destruction can be seen on-line), took place. This was no aberration. Even El-Haj had to mention the matter in her book (knowing that if she omitted it altogether, reviewers might notice), but she justified it as the uncharacteristic, but understandable reaction of desperate people, brought to the end of their collective tether by the diabolical behavior of the Israelis. <br /> <br />In Egypt, members of the Muslim Brotherhood even muttered about destroying the Pyramids, but cooler heads prevailed. It was not out of Egyptian nationalism, save among the Copts and a small sliver of the Egyptian elite, nor out of any respect for the pre-Islamic past, but rather the fact that too many Egyptians depend for their livelihood on tourist dollars, that managed to prevent attacks. Similarly, the tourist attraction of Petra seems safe, precisely because it is a money-maker, not out of some deep conviction that these Roman-era ruins are otherwise of note. <br /> <br />In Iraq, the old Sunni elites, trained by Gertrude Bell and others, did acquire a certain taste for preserving the pre-Islamic artifacts, and that seems to be the one exception - and an exception only among a very small sliver of Iraqi society -to the general indifference to any artifacts except those representing the time of Islam, not that of the pre-Islamic Jahiliyya. <br /> <br />Indeed, many Muslims oppose even Muslim sites which would distract from worship of Allah. When the Wahhabi under Abdul Aziz ibn Saud conquered Mecca, they razed to the ground virtually every old building then standing. An old Ottoman fort was one of the few buildings spared. In 2002, overnight, that Ottoman fort was also destroyed. <br /> <br />Like her distant mentor, the presiding genius domus over so much of Middle East matters today, Edward Said, El-Haj seems incapable of understanding that other societies, the representatives of other civilizations, are capable of studying the past as something other than a political project, and in Israel, as something other than working hand-in-glove with \\"Jewish settler-colonial nation state-building.\\" <br /> <br />That such a book was written, and published, is a disgrace. That its author was, at a time when hundreds or indeed thousands of worthy graduate students in this and related fields cannot find employment, was given a job at Columbia, is deplorable. <br />	2005-10-10
US	20599407	R2N4SJSCYBZTYE	0451528336	589543725	The Pilgrim's Progress (Signet Classics)	Books	3	0	1	N	N	Good Adventure, Mediocre Allegory	This novel is a profound work of immense religious significance.  It is, perhaps, second only to the Bible in popularity among Christians.  It is also one of the greatest literary allegories. <br /> <br />At least, this is what most literary critics would have you believe.  Make no mistake, I greatly enjoyed The Pilgrim's Progress.  It succeeds on many levels as an adventure novel.  Its attempt to be a piece of allegorical storytelling is where it fails.  None of the symbolism is especially deep and the characters all are named after (and stand for) virtues or vices.  Making every character nothing more than a talking symbol was a faulty move on author Bunyan's part (although after reading his introduction/apology, I believe this was his intention.)  As a result  the reader never invests any emotion into the characters and is prone to boredom as the story is told (although saying the pacing is quick would be a severe understatement.)  The lack of extensive characterization and exposition makes the novel read more like the Sunday newspaper than a living story.  There are also very few suprises in this novel.  Christian's (the main character) destination is revealed to us when the story begins, and because Christianity centers on good conquering evil, the reader can have no doubt that the hero will end up where he needs to be. <br /> <br />The Pilgrim's Progress is not without its strong points.  As stated above the pacing is very quick; the actual plot gets moving full-speed within the first three pages of the story and never lets up. For readers with short attention spans (such as myself) this is a great relief.  The story's simplicity also works to its advantage.  We are told that Christian must reach the Celestial City in order to escape damnation and be saved.  The entire book is simply a chronicle of his adventures along the way.  As stated, he meets virtues and vices and encounters all forms of moral peril (such as laziness) and environmental dangers (such as afiery mountain that consumes those who trust in one of Christian's enemies).  He even does battle with monsters.  Another one of the book's strengths is its appeal to \\"mere\\" Christianity, that is, it has a message with which every Christian sect would agree.  There are a few jabs at the Roman Catholic Church, but these are minor and extremely few.  Bunyan himself was a Puritan, a child of Protestantism, so small remarks such as these should not be of any real suprise.  They do not detract from the story in the least. <br /> <br />Of course, none of this attempts to be true, and the reader is told by the author himself that the story is presented in \\"the similitude of a dream\\".  Is the story dream-like?  Sure, it is fantastic enough.  Is it a clever allegory?  It is allegorical, but not terribly clever.  If you're in for a good adventure than this book is for you.  If you like your symbolism to have more thought than you may want to consult Lewis' Narnia series. <br /> <br />   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

The plot is nothing more than a dressed-up episode of \\"Law and Order: Wiseguy Division\\" and the reader is supposed to care if the amateur detective can solve the mystery of who killed his friend/mentor.  That type of melodrama bores me to tears.  <br /> <br />But I didn't stop reading it.  In fact, I couldn't stop.  I've never been so captivated, so mesmerized as I was with this wonderfully enlightening description of someone with Tourettes Syndrome. No, the plot isn't for me, but I found the lead character to be irresistible.   <br /> <br />An essential element for a book/movie to be satisfying for me is that I learn something.  In its description of someone with Tourettes, Motherless Brooklyn informs on the level of a medical journal expos masquerading as a Dashiell Hammett piece.  What I found most educational about the description of Lionel's condition was the internal dialogue of the echoes in his mind. Words become like taffy, as his mind stretches and twists them to almost unrecognizable forms of their original shape and then blurts them out to his confused listener. <br /> <br />He also can't keep his thoughts hidden, as any word on his mind builds up pressure in his brain and mouth until he lets it out.  This makes him tell his jokes' punch lines before they are appropriate, comment on the titillating aspects of a woman's body he should keep to himself and use taboo words when speaking to an African-American cop.   <br /> <br />Although these scenarios create uncomfortable and laugh-out-loud moments, they also shed light on the horror of someone not having control over their own speech.  The reader suffers with Lionel as he comes to terms with the affliction that forever haunts and limits him. <br /> <br />Yes, there is a plot and he tries to solve a mystery.  Without Lionel's condition, this bookwould not have been published, as it is nothing more than a run-of-the-mill murder mystery.  It also would have remained unread on my nightstand.  But because of Lionel, I sped through its pages, and honestly feel like it has added something to my life.    <br />	2005-10-10

While Bentley Little's Novella is easily the most original, fun, and scary of the bunch, Christopher Golden gets the runner up.

Simon Clark or Scott Nicholson would have been a better choice to fit in.  Finally, Douglas Clegg's \\"The Words\\", was my least favorite, rehashing old themes from Lovecraft.  Clegg is a solid writer, but whenever he goes into his abstract prose, it just becomes clumsy and confusing.  Still, this book is definitely worth reading, if for no other reason than to see the different styles and techniques of today's best horror writers.	2005-10-10

It describes the relationship between Nathan and his brother, Tom, and their lives with their grandparents after the death of their mother.<br /><br />The second, \\"Remembering,\\" is a denser, darker tale, focusing on Andy Catlett, an agricultural journalist and farmer, struggling to find himself after losing a hand (and his direction in life) in a farming accident. Reviewing his memories during a trip to an agricultural conference he is finally able to come to terms with the realities of his life and their value. This book is a testament to the virtues of the simple life Berry has been preaching for years.<br /><br />The third novel, \\"A World Lost,\\" introduces us to the young Andy Catlett in the year his uncle and namesake is murdered, an incident which impacts his life to come. It is only when he is older and able to investigate the incident himself that he is able to learn the truth about his hero.<br /><br />Wallace Stegner wrote that he found it hard to say whether he liked Berry better as poet, essayist or novelist, that he is all three and at a high level. The man lives the life he writes about. The author of more than 30 books, he lives and farms with his family in Henry County, Kentucky.	2005-10-10

Besides, the threats were aimed at her farm, not at her body.<br /><br />But the former Ranger's persistence intrigued her. Driven, yet strangely remote, he refused to be intimidated by her independent attitude. Worse, he politely turned down all of her suggestive invitations - which just enticed Nita more. Perhaps there was an enjoyable reason for having a round-the-clock protector.<br /><br />This is hot - Nita is different than any woman Connor has ever dealt with - she is a modern woman who goes after what she wants & what she wants is Connor & she won't take his half-hearted no's for an answer!

Books	5	3	3	N	N	Solid look at one of the greatest tactical leaders of WWII	Richard Lamb's `Montgomery in Europe 1943-1945: Success or Failure' is a solid piece of historical literature that lacks the bias oft observed in works dealing with a figure such as Monty.  Lamb is neither unfairly soft nor hard on Montgomery; he in fact presents a human portrait of the British Field Marshal that evokes a number of emotions from the reader toward this larger than life subject of military history, ranging from admiration and awe to empathy and understanding to disappointment and irritation.  One of the strongest points to come through in Lamb's work is that Monty was a man of consistency.  Montgomery's strong sense of purpose, confidence in self and those he led and desire to defeat the enemy on his terms with the lowest sacrifice of his men, produced in him the ability to instill both deep loyalty from subordinates who felt he was watching out for them, as well as distain from superiors who often felt him too cautious and slow.  On reading \\"Montgomery in Europe' one gets a clear picture that Monty's pros and cons were inevitable sides of the same coin - we couldn't have one without the other.  A similar picture of the man comes out in `Operation Victory', the wartime memoirs of Monty's former Chief of Staff, F. De Guigand.<br /><br />`Montgomery in Europe' is a well-written book that is accessible to readers from varied backgrounds and interest levels.  Lamb's style is not esoteric in the least and it takes very little time for the reader to establish a good rhythm.  The chapters are nicely parsed out and logical text breaks used where necessary.  Lamb is a serious historian as illustrated by his thorough research of the subject matter, citation of published and unpublished works (both primary and secondary), and his unbiased presentation of his findings.  As mentioned earlier Lamb presents himself as neither a Monty-phile nor Monty-phobe, his approach is even handed.  This is not to suggest that Lamb gives no opinions based on his research, he does, but they are clearly presented and argued with clarity provided by the solid research he has done.  Not all will agree with all of Lamb's conclusions but it is hard to argue that he has come to them unfairly or in an unsound manner.  Lots to learn here.<br /><br />In the end Lamb's book is a solid 4.5 star book worthy of a read, especially for those interested in Monty and his interactions with other figures and his historical place in the annals of the Allied defeat of Germany.es, but they are clearly presented and argued with clarity provided by the solid research he has done.

John Grisham has made a bunch of excellent court drama novels many of which became box office films. This time, however, he writes about pure football drama somewhat from his own experience as a high school football player(but not an all-american). It is just like Steven King writing human drama as shown in Different Seasons. It does not have so huge-scale plot as some of his voluminous novels such as A TIME TO Kill but the process of uncovering long-kept secret is really thrilling. As you read the scene of Neely Crenshaw's eurogy for Coach Rake you can never contain some tears.<br /><br />Verdict: Not a court drama as expected but heartfelt nice drama.<br /><br />Rating: 87 out of 100<br /><br />Recommended for every sports drama fans.<br /><br />Who will play Neely Crenshaw?

The occupations of the people whose stories are relayed in this volume are varied, and range from those working as office workers, those who are students or who are serving in the US military, and of course those working as the obligatory ESL teacher.  The nationalities are as diverse as the occupations - as well as people of Korean descent, there are also Americans, Japanese, Filipinos, and New Zealanders, all of whom have interesting stories to tell about various aspects of their lives in Korea. <br /> <br />The book is split into 6 main sections, each dealing with a particular general aspect of life in Korea. One section is about working in Korea, another discusses social relations in Korea.  People of Korean descent share their experiences in one section, and students in Korea get another section.  A particularly interesting section is dedicated to those people who have formally made Korea their home, including one white US male who renounced his American citizenship to become a Korea.  The final section, which I suspect will be the cause of most people's interest in this book is teaching in Korea.  This is hardly surprising since ESL teaching is a relatively high profile and popular occupation for many young foreigners in Korea. <br /> <br />All but one of the contributors to the teaching section have taught in Hagwons, the most common employer of ESL teachers in Korea.  The sole exception was the contributor who had only taught as an university instructor, although a number of the Hagwon teachers also went on to teach at a university - again hardly surprising, since it is quite a popular gig, usually teaching 15 hours or so a week, for nearly twice the pay of a Hagwon teacher.  This section will be of most use to those readers who plan on teaching in Korea, as a number of the contributors discuss the common pitfalls for a novice in this field, and tips to help get by.  This isn't to say the other sections aren't of interest.  Many of the contributors give interesting insights into life, love, work and play in the Land of the Morning Calm.  Recommended reading for those wanting insights into life in modern Korea, as well as those considering teaching in Korea. <br /> <br />    <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

There is a subject index and an author index.  A bit of nonsense, but D. B. Wyndham Lewis and Charles Lee must have had fun chosing what they considered the worst of the lot.  Of course, everyone has his own opinion and, what's bad for someone may be good to someone else and vice versa.

I hear Jeremy Brett in every word of Holmes dialogue in these novels.<br /><br />As the fans of a television show will detail events going on offstage during an episode, Douglas shows us details of Holmes' investigations that would not have seemed pertinent to Conan Doyle as he wrote -- but he might well have been thinking of them. Douglas twangs every Holmsian heartstring with her deft expansion of the Doyle tales.<br /><br />There is one difference though. Douglas shows us a 21st Century woman in Irene Adler, a woman truly with A Soul of Steel, (as the novel Irene At Large will be retitled with its December 2005 release).  This is a woman Doyle could never have written and his readers probably would not have accepted.<br /><br />But to us, Adler's biography makes her attitude plausible.  We can easily believe she bested Sherlock Holmes more than once.<br /><br />Even if you've never read any Sherlock Holmes -- read the Irene Adler novels.<br /><br />Spider Dance is very special though.  It has come out at the same time that Laurie R. King's new Mary Russell/Sherlock Holmes novel Locked Rooms has appeared.<br /><br />The two novels both focus on an investigation into a dark childhood hidden behind trauma induced blocks.

The amphibuous operations in the Arakan, the mountainous warfare in Imphal/ Kohima, the follow up and eventual capture of Mytkylia, the fall of Rangoon and the final operations in the Pegu Yomas are all here providing a well written overview.<br /><br />The main goal of the Imperial War Museum Books series is to use first-person accounts as much as possible in the text. I would say that the usage can at times be rather thick but it does not take away from the general flow of the narrative.<br /><br />Reminicenses of Empire soldiers, especially the Royal Indian Army, that made up the bulk of the attacks in Burma are lacking, and Thompson is the first to admit and regret this... there is simply not that much written down... (in fairness I am sure that there is a lot of memoirs in India, but they are not readily available in England and Thompson was using what he has from the Imperial War Museum).<br /><br />Also there is little on the operational views of the Japanese but that requires a historian who is capable of reading Japanese sources... once again Louis Allan's book \\"Burma: The Longest War\\" is the definitive read on Japanese intentions and assessments).<br /><br />There is also a curious aside on what must be one of the most hotly debated subjects of WWII: the effectivness and supposed genius of Major Gen Orde Wingate. I will say little of this, but that this is again an Army man (Thompson) evaluating him in Army terms.... I agree with his analyses. I will leave it at that as the discussion is quite long and involved for a book of this length.<br /><br />All in all the best intro to the Burma campaign available in print.in all the best intro to the Burma campaign available in print.	2005-10-10

After reading `The Art of Faery'  I was intrigued, hooked and wanted more and was able to find delightful websites from the information in the index which I have been able to follow the work and careers of those artists. This book is a real WOW of the Faery World, introduced to us by no less than Alan Lee that master of middle earth and now acclaimed conceptual designer and Academy award winner of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings film. That both Froud and Lee have chosen to mentor the artists within these books is no surprise when you see the glorious creative imagination and varied display and interpretation in the new volume `The World of Faery'.<br /><br />My mother, bless her, introduced me to fairies as a child with a wonderful very large book called a `Day in Fairyland', how wonderful to discover that the artist Ann Mari Sjogren is still alive and at 87 has contributed her work and her life story into this book, it somehow brings back all the magic of my childhood a sort of Fairy Godmother amongst today's greats and surely tomorrows as well. `The World of Faery' is a feast of talent, this book takes us forward with the work and lives of the artists I was introduced to in `The Art of Faery' and if that wasn't exciting enough introduces ten new exciting artists, who expand the horizons further.<br /><br />From the Gothic vision of an Amy Brown front jacket ( Luna Sprite) inviting us to an outstanding foreword and images by Alan Lee  are captured within the covers of this colorful edition, the cherubic and whimsy of Myrea Pettit and James Brown, the variety to be found is seemingly endless, and has been comprised of all mediums: watercolor, ink, oil, and pastel and now a small use of digital work has been added to show the possibilities of 21st century mediums but used only by artists whose background skills using other media is accepted, here Renee Biertempfel shows how she excels,  John Arthur (his colourful drawing a tribute for his wife Maureen sadly ill with cancer),  Jasmine Becket-Griffith ( those eyes fascinate), Linda Biggs ( I've seen her twice now on TV with her art), Hazel Brown (I would love to walk in a wood with her just to see the amazing images in pen and ink evolve), Jacqueline Collen-Tarrolly( beginning now to develop her own style),  Jessica Galbreth (introduces us to her fairy visions, she is such a creative artist) , Natalia Pierandrei,( stylish Italian and colourful), Stephanie Pui-Mun Law (imaginative detailed but always graceful), Linda Ravenscroft (Stunning , rich and very moving, just look at that Goblin Tree), Paulina Stuckey-Cassidy (whimsical delight), Ryu Takeuchi ( A Japanese fairy force really going places) Kim Turner (shows bold colourful Australian fairies)  Maria J. William ( beautiful drawing). What is so pleasing is that so many new male artists are introduced  painting the fairy genre, Corey Randall, Scott Grimando, Jeff Spackman and Marc Potts are all recognised for their talents here, but for me it is the widening of the interests in this book of mind, body, and soul, and the spiritual enlightenment to mother earth  that held me spellbound ,Virginia Lee ( where did she get that creative imagination?) and  Josephine Wall ( a contribution so detailed her imagination excels). The use of double page spreads in this book Flight of the Lynx ( Josephine Wall), Mystic Garden  (Linda Ravenscroft ) and Swan Lake (Scott Grimando) add to the excitement and detail that here indeed are the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of fairy artists of this part the 21st century. This coffee table book is a delight for all ages to appreciate the genre and become involved and deserving of six stars if that were possible.	2005-10-10

Police departments in many regions across the United States say methamphetamine now represents 70-80% of their drug cases. Why? Meth is a cheap buzz and can be homemade with over-the-counter chemicals and cold remedies. It's also very quick to addict the user. <br /> <br />Federal surveys indicate that: <br />- 12 million Americans have used meth. <br />- More than 6% of high school seniors have tried it at least one time. <br />- 4% of nation's 8th graders have used it once. <br />- 2004 more than 17,000 meth labs were seized, compared to 7,500 in 1999. <br />- Meth abusers now account for more than 55% of all the people who seek help for addiction. <br /> <br />Today the phenomenon has moved to the heartland, the Midwest, and is moving east into big cities. It is no longer the drug of choice just for outlaw motorcycle gangs. <br /> <br />A gram can sell for $125, ounce $1700, a pound $13,000. But the mid 1990s, meth users discovered that they could make a less-pure form by themselves by copying recipes found on the Internet. <br /> <br />The drug's lure is that it produces a: <br />-- stunning burst of energy, <br />-- a feeling of euphoria, <br />-- heightened power of concentration, <br />-- a buoyant sense of self esteem, <br />-- an enhanced sex drive. <br /> <br />Smoking meth brings as much as an 8 to 12 hour high and 50% of the meth stays in the body after 24 hours. Meth seduces people who work long hours and become exhausted and females who use it to lose weight. The rush makes people feel great, as it affects the part of the brain that rewards people for doing things needed for human survival. <br /> <br />Now that you understand the who, what and why, it's important that every citizen learns how this drug is invading our country, being made in city apartments, small towns and abandoned farms or cabins.  <br /> <br />The author, a senior writer and Chicago Bureau Chief for Newsweek, discusses mom and pop labs; women and meth; meth in the gay community; and young faces of meth. Prisons are bursting with meth users. Imagine being a child of meth users who don't sleep or eat for days while acting bizarre, and certainly not taking care of the children in their home. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: If you are a parent, get smart about meth so you know more than your teen does. If you are a citizen, understand the emotional and financial disaster that meth is bringing into your town. Johnson's stories will blow your mind and break your heart. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

It is not, however, a landmark novel.  I think it has more in common with Judy Blume than J.D. Salinger. Holden Caufield, Salinger's protagonist, hated phonies, and the novel was an indictment of pretension and modernism.  Mastbaum's protagonist, Sam, and the object of his affection, Clay, are both exactly the type of shallow phonies that Caufield hated.  I liked this novel; just not as much as I hoped to.	2005-10-10

Montaigne was a humanist and a skeptic in his philosophical approach, and essentially looked at his own experience as the first topic for examination always.<br /><br />The book of Essays was one he worked on periodically throughout his life, issuing different editions, the first of which appeared in 1580. Montaigne's style of writing is sometimes stream-of-consciousness, sometimes structured in more formal styles.<br /><br />Montaigne's stated task in his preface to the reader is for self-examination, but it becomes very clear that Montaigne sees himself as an 'everyman' character. He strives for full-disclosure; indeed, he writes that were he another culture 'which are said to live still in the sweet freedom of nature's first laws', then he might have appeared naked.<br /><br />This is a complete set of the Essays, together with a helpful introduction and notes for reading.  As Montaigne added to his essays periodically, they are not necessarily in the order he wrote them, but this collection has preserved their order according to his standards.<br /><br />Montaigne's essays show a pessimism and skepticism, perhaps based on the kinds of conflicts between Catholics and Protestants going on, in France and elsewhere, as well as the periodic flare of plague. He was a humanist who saw cultures as having value internal to themselves and preferred to not universalise morals, laws and other ideas.<br /><br />Montaigne was sometimes conventional in thought (seeing marriage as necessary for children, and distrusting the idea of romantic love), but other times he was very much a free thinker (particularly when it came to religious dogma or absolutist kinds of philosophical paradigms). Montaigne had respect for those who followed religious codes and ways of life, but distrusted those who tried to impose such ideas upon others.<br /><br />Montaigne added to his essays twice in major ways, but did not strive for consistency or systematic ways of thinking - he declined to remove previous essays if they contradicted new writings.<br /><br />Montaigne is perhaps the most important French philosopher prior to the Enlightenment. His essays remain popular because they have a sense of the modern and the current about them.ied to impose such ideas upon others.  <br /> <br />Montaigne added to his essays twice in major ways, but did not strive for consistency or systematic ways of thinking - he declined to remove previous essays if they contradicted new writings.  <br /> <br />Montaigne is perhaps the most important French philosopher prior to the Enlightenment.

No, despite being a product of Terry Pratchett's imagination, I didn't 'love' this one, but it worked well on several levels.<br /><br />As a kid's book:  Taking this one up against a tough audience, a remarkably intelligent and precocious 4-yr old girl, it did very well.  She was able to follow the idea of a dad reading a book to his child as the theme of the book, and clearly understood that Dad (in the book) was taking liberties with the text.  And that Mom caught Dad taking liberties with the book went over very well (the girl involved laughed so hard she nearly threw up).  The illustrations were a big hit with the young lady, and she was particularly taken with the pet dragons.<br /><br />As an addendum to \\"Thud!\\", by the same author.  It works, but not quite as well.  There is a new artist illustrating \\"Where's My Cow?\\", and this artist's style doesn't (I feel) work as well for DiscWorld characters.  \\"Where's My Cow\\" is fairly central to \\"Thud\\", so to see the book it self was somewhat rewarding, but a strict rendition of \\"Where's my Cow\\" would have been fairly lame.  So liberties were taken to make it more appealing to a general audience and for parents to read to children.<br /><br />As a father reading this book to my kid: It works well.  Any parent can see how well DiscWorld holds up the mirror to life in how Sam Vimes plays with his son as he reads this book.  Any parent has suffered through the sixtieth reading of a book written on a two year old level, and many of us have succumb to the desire to make those dreadful children's books a little more interesting.  Many of us have also been intensely browbeaten by our wives for this.  (Informal research indicates that the desire to take liberties with kids' books is a dad thing, hence the gender specific language).  To see this as the theme of a kids' book is a hoot.  Also, the way this book is written, it invites using different voices for different aspects of the book, a great source of entertainment for the munchkins.<br /><br />In all, I would only read it once for myself, maybe twice for the illustrations, but don't mind reading it numerous times for the young'un (and the young'un is just fine with this).for the munchkins. <br /> <br />In all, I would only read it once for myself, maybe twice for the illustrations, but don't mind reading it numerous times for the young'un (and the young'un is just fine with this).	2005-10-10

This book on Kahn is essentially a \\"sequel\\" to McCarter's incredible book on Wright. McCarter traces the details of Kahn's projects and often uncovers little-known but important works. Like the book on Wright, this book focuses on the unfolding of Kahn's architectural philosphy through his career via a study of his built and unbuilt works. This discussion is immersed in the details of each project. <br /> <br />An unfair review of McCarer's previous book overlooked the fact that the lush descriptions and details are essential to grasping the architectual ideas and philosophy. I doubt the reviewer had the patience to work through the entire book. Often you need to study a floor-plan, then return to McCarter's text, then study it again to really understand McCarter is telling you. Thus this book is interactive; you must engage it as thoroughly as it engages you. <br /> <br />Yay, the floor plans are larger! My only criticism is that McCarter should have kept the layout the same as the Wright book. Pages lacking page numbers, references to photos far from the photos themselves, sideways text (???) on chapter headings, image subtitles far from the images themselves, and \\"backtracking\\" to give overviews of a project all create confusion. Therefore I disagree with the amazon reviewer, I find the content to be wonderful, but the layout poor, unlike Kahn's works. <br /> <br />I see many mentions of Le Corbusier. Perhaps another project for McCarter? I would buy it in a second.	2005-10-10

The Ottomans reached great heights of civilization and remained a substantial threat to Europe until at least the second siege of Vienna in 1683. But, from the 1700's onward, the Ottoman Empire began to stagnate and fall behind the West. Meanwhile, Europe was reaching new levels of scientific advancement and political freedom.<br /><br />The book compares and contrasts the Islamic and Western worlds through its various chapters focusing on specific topics such as military power, economic wealth and differing notions about social restrictions and cultural barriers. The general theme is that the Muslim world thrived during its period of greatest tolerance and openess to new ideas. But then began to lose ground as the West charged forward into the techonological, political and social revolutions that modernized the world.<br /><br />Lewis maintains a remarkable degree of objectivity and historical perspective. He celebrates the great accomplishments of Islamic history while also showing how the Muslim world's increasing arrogance and xenophobia caused it to become a closed society that was unwilling to accept and adapt the important new ideas and innovations of the non-Muslim West. An excellent example of this is how the Muslim world failed to begin use of the printing press on a large scale for over 300 years, partially because it was seen as a potential desecration of the sacred Arabic script in which the Qu'ran was written.<br /><br />This outstanding book is primarily historical in content. But it is very easy to see its examples depicted in the contemporary world.

It is also one of the only books that addresses the issue of people and talent development as a strategic need.  It provides a rationale for talent development and an updated review of how the field of training has evolved into Workplace Learning and Performance.

My daughter is not a particularily poor reader, but I realise that she is a little confused and often guesses at words (she seems very much to be someone who is trying to memorise words by sight). <br />It is a simple to use method, with VERY clear instructions, I find them a little too authoritarian and have to guiltily admit I sometimesadapt them slightly.  However, following the course closely has highlighted problems I did not suspect before.  For example; I discovered that the idea of \\"magic e\\" which the Mc Guinesses frown on, has confused my son, so that he doesn't fully understand that the letters \\"g\\" and \\"r\\" in grow, have to be adjacent. <br />The course does take time and organisation, but the analysis of sounds is the most thorough I've come across.

The author uses security generically, blending physical security and information security. Most people do not do that, but I think Patterson is simply a year or two ahead of his time. <br /> <br />The first 1/3 of the book was a bit of a waste for me, sort of a know thyself without little exercises. Then you hit the good stuff. <br /> <br />All Americans should read page 105 at least twice. This is also where the value of this book becomes apparent, I will read this section at least one more time. I don't know how much credence I would put in the Mapping Security Index (MSI), where the author tries to quantify the ROSI of doing business in a particular part of the world or another, but the annecdotal bits are great. I have a much better understanding of why my own company has had such an odd experience doing business in Europe.  <br /> <br />If you are an American and you have an IT security position with a company doing business in the wider world ( and who doesn't) then I recommend this book.  I also recommend a movie called the Coca Cola Kid.  It is a bit off color, but it can really help explain why we make the mistakes we make.	2005-10-10

It's completely up to date on a subject that very much needs to be up to date.  The second thing to notice is the tag line on the cover: \\"500+ entries for parents and professionals.\\"  This is a good book for counselors, parents, grandparents, ministers and other people who are not specialists but who find themselves called upon to help people with concerns about autism.<br /><br />The third thing to notice is the long list of contributors, that is, the professionals who wrote the entries.  Professor Emeritus John Neisworth and Associate Professor Pamela S. Wolfe of The Pennsylvania State University are the editors of the book and the authors of many of the entries.  However there are (I counted them) 123 other professionals who penned the mini essays that make up the bulk of the book.  They come from all over the world and from a number of relevant disciplines.  They are doctors, academics, therapists, teachers, heads of institutions, etc.  Clearly this is an authoritative work.<br /><br />Each entry is focused on how it relates to autism.  For example the entry for \\"depression,\\" signed by Britta Saltonstall, allows that \\"Study has demonstrated the co-occurrence of depression and autism.\\"  Note the careful terminology: \\"co-occurrence\\" instead of any other sort of linkage.  However in their entry on the \\"Premack principle,\\" Neisworth and Wolfe don't relate \\"Grandma's Law\\" (to do the less agreeable activity before the more agreeable one) directly to autism, noting only that therapists in general might want to require it of their clients.<br /><br />Some of the language is technical and some of it is highly technical, and almost all of it is carefully hedged and qualified.  The influence of mainstream psychology, including behaviorism and cognitive psychology is evident.  I wish that, in addition, interpretations from evolutionary psychology were more in evidence.  I don't think we can hope to understand disorders like autism outside of an evolutionary perspective.<br /><br />In this context it is strange to read that \\"natural environment\\" refers to home and community and everyday activities like eating and shopping.  It's hard to argue with this, but the implication seems to be that other environments might be seen as \\"contrived.\\"  When I think about it, this perspective might be a hint about the cause of the recent dramatic increase in the instance of autism: green fields and forest lands, river beds and ocean beaches, savanna and woodland, may indeed be, for today's people, \\"contrived\\" rather than natural environments.  And the \\"natural environment\\" of concrete streets and homes constructed with manmade materials and artificially made foods is what we are stuck with.  Personally I think some types of autism may be better understood as alternative strategies for coping with the world; however, the more severe manifestations are clearly disorders, some of them disabling.<br /><br />Also apparent in the book is how autism is viewed today.  Once thought to be a disease caused by \\"refrigerator mothers\\" (Bruno Bettelheim)--women of cold affect who emotionally and mentally isolated their children--autism is now seen as a \\"spectrum of disorders\\" whose etiology \\"is not clear, but accumulating evidence suggests a neurological basis that may relate to inheritable factors\\" with \\"environmental stressors\\" also \\"implicated.\\"  Under \\"autism spectrum disorder (ASD)\\" we find that the terminology is synonymous with \\"pervasive developmental disorder\\" (PDD) which includes Rhett syndrome, Asperger syndrome and others.  There is a \\"catch all\\" category called \\"pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified\\" (PDD-NOS).<br /><br />The book has 22 pages of references including ones from all four editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (an evolving compendium).  Even Bruno Bettelheim's now infamous The Empty Fortress: Infantile Autism and the Birth of the Self is referenced.  However nothing appears by Temple Grandin, who is probably the world's most famous, and one of its most accomplished, autistics.  By contrast, in another book on autism, Autism Spectrum Disorders (2004) by Chantal Sicile-Kira, there are eight references to Grandin's work.  So, even though this book is copyrighted in 2005, it may not be as entirely up to date as might be expected.<br /><br />There are two excellent appendices, one on \\"Screening and Assessment Tools and Curricula\\" and another on research, therapeutic, and informational organizations.  Each entry in these appendices is annotated and explained.  Addresses, both snail and email, and sometimes phone numbers are included.tress: Infantile Autism and the Birth of the Self is referenced.

There are a lot of bad fantasy books coming out these days. Some almost mirror the work of Tolkien and his popular descendants such as Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan. Some of them lack character and subjective points of view so much that it's unbearable. This, however, is not one of those books. True, it shares somewhat of an average fantasy plot, but it's absolutely worth reading.  <br />Despite the mildly normal plot, Eldest is FAST. There's always some riveting event that only makes you want to keep turning the pages more and more until you've run out of them. The world the author has created is also quite fascinating. I think I could almost imagine myself living there, whereas while reading other fantasy books I think \\"Jeez, what would I do here if there wasn't a war going on?\\" <br />Also, Paolini does an excellent job balancing out the flaws in each race, which is unusual for a fantasy for the age group he's writing for and even for fantasy books in general. For instance, the elves, although they are powerful and wise, are sometimes contemptful towards the other races and think themselves too powerful to intervene. The Dwarves have many, many customs that vary from tribe to tribe, and very many conflicting opinions as well. One thing a Dwarf of one tribe may do can easily insult one of another. The Humans, of course, are much too ambitious, at times, and the Urgals are so dramatically different from the other races that they are hard to cope with. <br />Another thing Paolini does that is very unusual for a fantasy author is question the evil of the enemy. He doesn't do this to the point which Eragon goes to the other side, that would ruin the story, but it does a little bit. For instance, when Eragon is training with Oromis, Oromis says something along the lines of \\"Tell me Eragon, are Urgals evil?\\" Eragon says.\\"Yes.\\" Oromis says \\"Why?\\" Eragon is confused. He says,\\"I've seen them kill thousands of humans without thought. It's obvious they don't care for us.\\" Oromis replies\\"Perhaps they have reason not to.\\" Sure enough, some Urgals come up later who are willing to fight against Galbatorix. <br />Why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5 then? Well, although he shows great potential, Paolini is nevertheless an author who's writing needs to mature. For one, he really needs to improve on is dialogue. Eragon, a boy who grew up in a poor village in the mountains where he probably didn't get a whole lot of an education is constantly saying things like \\"Are all of your steeds as noble as these?\\" Sorry Mr. Paolini, but no. As well as this, there are some points when he sort of takes stuff right out of Lord of the Ring(they don't happen too much, but sometimes). For instance, he has the elves ride horses without saddles and speak to them in elvish to say where they want them to go. That's also a bit irritating. But even so, I encourage you all to read it.	2005-10-10

During the time of the first Princess Mio the land Hikami had been overrun by chaos and war. Of the two clans warring were the Hi and the Yu. The spirit of the great King Haku was sealed and many warriors perished in the battle. 500 years later the greatest of the warriors were reborn into 6 new bodies to continue the struggle of their former lives.<br /><br />Princess Mio the eleventh has been murdered by a clansman of Gessho Kuki named Goki, and a man named Mitsufusa Kamurogi steps up to fill her place much to everyone's anger. Mizuki, one of the six reincarnated warriors, points out to his stepfather (Mitsufusu) that Princess Mio the first has been reincarnated into Akira, and by all rights she should be the reigning leader. This is agreed upon by all, but it may not be in enough time as war breaks out fresh between the two clans.<br /><br />As far as manga went, this was a bit too confusing for my tastes. There was a lot of immediate action that left me befuddled, and the sheer number of characters introduced are all hard to keep straight. Yes, there are the six initial warriors, but then there are all these other people that keep getting thrown into the mix and it's just too confusing. Which side are these people on, what is there meaning in the grand scheme of things, etc. etc. Perhaps this is one of those series that I would benefit reading further into, but I don't know that I care about it enough to do so. The art is ok, but not as clean as I like it, and that combined with the aforementioned  flaws makes me think that I will not be picking up the next volume, if it ever were to be released.	2005-10-10

I promptly picked up a copy and sat down to read it. It soon became clear what the premise of the story was, nevertheless I kept reading, hoping that the story would close with some redeeming message. I was wrong. This book is a pathetic example of the book market for teenage girls today. I know because I am one. The whole premise stated that, sure, it's okay to go behind your parent's back to have sex with your boyfriend. It's okay to lose your virginity to someone you've known for 6 months. Better yet, it's not even okay, it's ideal! (Odd that my name is Virginia, isn't it?) <br />While nothing in the book was explicitly sexual, it was heavily sprinkled with innuendo--and obviously the entire premise was sexual. I was very disappointed with what Miss Cabot chose to write. What can I do? Nothing except to pretend that the series ended with the first book.	2005-10-10

Standing tall next to my fellow classmates, we spoke the words that ostensibly represented our country of America.  Year after year this salute became ingrained in my head - not as a poem that reminded me of my patronage, but as a boring and irrelevant chore that I never thought to question. Today the Pledge of Allegiance is no longer mandated in schools, but it continues to be a controversial debate in politics.  This topic is the subject of Richard Ellis' To the Flag: The Unlikely History of the Pledge of Allegiance. <br />At first glance, you might assume that this novel is solely a political scientist's objective articulation of history, and after reading the first five or six chapters, of facts regarding the Pledge.  However, as Ellis begins to dive into the controversy surrounding the Pledge, he uncovers the significance of its success as a symbol of American identity, the changes it went through and why, and what it represents for citizens today.  His historical style effectively traces the original Pledge, written in 1892 by Francis Bellamy, to the 2004 Supreme Court decision that made the thirty-one word oath unconstitutional. <br />For over a century, especially in the aftermath of mass immigration, World War II, the Cold War, and 9/11, the Pledge of Allegiance has played an important role in defining the American identity.  The natural tendency of citizens is to unify against the current conflict, forcing them to justify their Americanness and allegiance to their country.  Those who seem less patriotic are perceived as traitors.  At these crucial times in history, nothing seemed to express more gratitude and respect than the salute to the flag while reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.    <br />Before the turn of the 20th century, there was a deep feeling of anxiety as America experienced an influx of foreigners immigrating into the schools, the work force, and the social communities.  This sparked a movement to \\"Americanize\\" the immigrant children, and \\"create a `new man' from the mixture of different nationalities (pg 38).\\"  The first step in Americanizing immigrants begins with the understanding of the American identity.  The United States has no distinct religion, race, culture, or heritage, and this diversity is what truly represents America.  Ellis posits, \\"For most peoples, national identity is the product of a long process of historical evolution involving common ancestors, common experiences, and common ethnic backgrounds (pg 213).\\"  Therefore, the American identity is a myth that our nation has persistently attempted to construct.  There was a strong effort made to subdue the anxiety of immigration by federally funding the placement of the American flag in schools, and requiring the Pledge of Allegiance to be recited everyday.  Soon the Pledge became the prime symbol of American patriotism, and with its success came resistance and disapproval.  Many worried that \\"the flag salute, the singing, the national self-glorification will result in a nation of swashbucklers, not of patriots (pg.82).\\"  Students who protested or refused to recite the Pledge were suspended from school, whipped by teachers, arrested, and in some cases imprisoned.  Furthermore, some students who opposed the Pledge refrained from protesting, simply to avoid the embarrassment of being ostracized in front of their peers.  <br />Those who opposed the Pledge faced even more insurmountable hurdles as the Cold War initiated a \\"fight against a common enemy: atheistic Communism (pg 130).\\"  During this religious revival, many supported the movement to add the words `Under God' in the Pledge - further emphasizing the nation's religious identity of the time.  Ellis states that \\"the strength of the United States, in the view of many, was its religious faith.  And it was faith in God that distinguished the United States from the godless Communists (pg 127).\\"  The addition of these two words may have distinguished our country from the Communists, but it excluded many people that either believed in more than one God or none at all.  Moreover, it overrides the Constitutional Principles of the separation of church and state.  Former President George H.W. Bush makes it clear in his response regarding atheists: \\"I don't know that Atheists should be considered citizens, nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under God (pg 218).\\"   <br />It is obvious that the Pledge had good intentions when it was first written in 1892.  Aside from being a nation under God, the words represent what our nation as a whole strives to symbolize.  To the Flag clarifies the irony of the rhetoric in the Pledge, `a nation under God, indivisible, with liberty, and justice for all.'  In schools, our youth have been forced to recite the Pledge, and ironically this mocked the liberties they pledged.  The notion that we live in a nation of indivisibility is completely false.  Issues of class, race, gender, and religion have divided this nation for hundreds of years and continue to smear the image of equality.  The Pledge does not represent the American identity; it simplifies and distorts the reality of our society and excludes so many individuals who constitute our nation.  Ellis says it best when he reveals the true paradox of the Pledge: \\"backers of the Pledge are often cast as true patriots, but it is arguably those who would dispense a daily Pledge who harbor the greatest faith in the enduring power and strength of American institutions and American ideals (pg 222).\\" Ellis subtly reveals this important paradox to allow advocates of the Pledge to measure their own true spirit as Americans.  Through this realization, they may begin to understand the reality of our nation, with or without a God, striving for indivisibility, liberty, and justice for all.  <br />	2005-10-10

The new intros and \\"director's cut\\" footnotes may not quite justify the $25 hardcover purchase price (off the rack, anyway), but most of the columns are plenty entertaining on multiple readings and there's nothing wrong with giving the Sports Guy incentive to come out with another book (perhaps with more new material, as another reviewer wrote). <br /> <br />The only real problem with the book is the shockingly high level of misspellings and printing errors (a half-sentence in italics that shouldn't be, a footnote that isn't in bold superscript, a sentence that was accidentally written twice in a row, etc.).  I expect the occasional gaffe from Simmons' online columns, but didn't someone look this over before sending it to be bound?  Hopefully these errors will be corrected for future editions.  (I know this may seem like nitpicking, but believe me, it takes you right out of a book when things like this keep jumping out at you.)	2005-10-10

And, honestly, when's the last time there was a quick and interesting read about economics?<br /><br />The book could use both more length and depth, but hopefully that will come in the form of a sequel.<br /><br />Recommended for those looking for a fun and interesting quickie read. Not so recommended for those hoping this is a profound work that will somehow change their life.	2005-10-10

It opens the reader up to new horizons and forces him to dwell upon things that the average person would never normally experience. Pi's messages on religion and his insight about survival really engage the reader and give another outlook on life. It caused me to appreciate the life that I have. I agree with Pi's comment on the fact that everyone's mission is just to love God. In other words, what particular religion you belong to is not what is important. In my opinion, this was one of the main messages of the book, and I think that it is significant for everyone in all religions to realize this concept. However, I found Pi's constant struggle for survival to be quite repetitive after awhile, and at some times I became sick to my stomach. I also think that the two solutions offered in the ending, which the entire second part of the book led up to, caused the reader to lose trust in Pi's honesty. I don't think it matched up to the rest of the book, which is so good. That is what caused me to have mixed feelings about the book. But in general, I would recommend the book to anyone, because it is truly a remarkable adventure for Pi and a dramatic learning experience for the reader.	2005-10-10
US	52970727	R3P41GBTZE81RM	0970027419	348742785	Noah	Books	3	3	10	N	N	Interesting read, but based on contorted reading of Genesis	Although this book is an interesting read, it is all based on a contorted reading of Genesis 6:2: \\"The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of  all which they chose.\\"<br /><br />According to this author the sons of God are actually fallen angels. So for devils we can now read \\"sons of God\\". And the main reason the earth had to be destroyed is that these devils had intercourse with descendants of Adam. The genetic profile was being destroyed.<br /><br />That is a reading that is not supported by any other verse in the Bible, and the verses before and after this verse will cause any honest reader to reject this hypothesis.<br /><br />Verse one for example says: \\"And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born<br /><br />unto them\\". Even Ellen Gunderson Taylor has to take the word \\"men\\" here as \\"descendents from Adam\\", else she could not write a book where the intercourse between the \\"descendents of Adam\\" and devils is the reason given for the flood. And in verse three the word \\"men\\" also must mean \\"descendents of Adam\\". Verse three: \\"And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also [is] flesh.\\" Clearly angelic beings are not flesh, are they? Verse six is the final nail in the coffin of this interpretation: \\"And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth\\". Angels, even devils, cannot be said to be \\"made man on the earth.\\"<br /><br />According to this author these devils and their descendants had te ability of split and join the atom. Technologically mankind before the flood was even more advanced then we are know. This is clearly a myth, but not as indefensible as her interpretation of Genesis. But if these people were so advanced, it would be quite unlikely that they would view the sun as the ultimate being, because the sun is just a big fusion reactor. And if they had fission and fusion, wouldn't it be easy for them to survive the flood? Our nuclear submarines can stay below the sea for the duration of the flood, so why couldn't they?<br /><br />I still give the book three stars, because it is reasonably well written. And the author doesn't shy away from discussing other scientific issues raised by the flood like \\"where their rainbows before the flood?\\" and \\"how could all these animals fit in the ark?\\"e the flood?

My concern is that enough people will surpise the proponents and buy enough used and black market goods that the revenue will dwindle and the income tax will return. <br /> <br />\\"Replace today's indecipherable tax code with one simple sales tax.\\" <br />HR 25's mere 130-something pages will be RIPE for 'deciphering,' as lobbyists and tax lawyers plow through it and increase its text from year to year to year... <br /> <br />\\"Protect lower-income Americans by covering the tax on basic necessities.\\" <br />This alludes to the 'prebate,' that everyone has to apply for every single year. It smacks of an administrative nightmare on a scale BIGGER than the rushes seen on April 15th... <br /> <br />\\"Eliminate billions of dollars in embedded taxes we don't even know we're paying.\\"  <br />If taxes are eliminated, who 'takes up the slack?' I don't understand why stockholders can't pay taxes on their holdings, and why private corporations can't pay taxes on their private profits. <br /> <br />\\"Bring offshore corporate dollars back into the U.S. economy.\\"  <br />Actually, HR 25 will send billions of dollars OFF-SHORE, as wealthy Americans buy their cars, planes, yachts, and new vacation homes somewhere else, where they are all 1/3-less expensive! <br />	2005-10-10

This is a strange book. Despite the giant word \\"WEB\\" on the cover, it's difficult to see this as \\"best practices for web-based software.\\" Instead, it reads like a guide for designers who've only built desktop software and are being forced against their will to deliver a web-based product.<br /><br />It's far too long at 658 pages; there are needless sections on general suggestions for designing for the web that are far better written about elsewhere. I understand the authors' desire for completeness, but there's just too much basic HTML here padding out some sections.<br /><br />And the final *seven* chapters deal with the design of data reports, charts, graphs, and even maps. Now, these are important topics, but they are not such significant parts of most web applications to deserve more than half this book's length. And have these authors never read Edward Tufte? It's hard to imagine a collection of uglier, more garishly colored, visually heavy maps and diagrams than what's presented here.<br /><br />It's a little annoying, too, that most of the diagram images come from *desktop* applications like Excel or Crystal Reports, not web applications. There's a good reason for that: these kinds of data-intense diagrams tend to be for specialist users committed to spending long hours in an application. In most cases, that's a situation that calls for the more powerful capabilities of a desktop application. When's the last time you looked at a scatter plot on a web site?<br /><br />But between the dull basics of the first chapters and the mind-bending statistical overkill of the last seven, there are some good and useful sections. For example, there are good rules of thumb for form layouts, handling input validation gracefully, and search filtering. There's nothing adventerous or innovative here, of course. Advice tends toward the conservative and reliable list view-to-object view model (the way your email program works), with a few breaks for product comparison interfaces. As in so many of these kinds of books, the authors also include examples of utterly pointless novelty interfaces (zooming lenses, radial tree navigation schemes, photo \\"data mountains\\") that are notable for their near-total absence outside the HCI lab.<br /><br />The strange thing about this book, and others like it, is the almost willful blindness of what *actually* works in web application design, and what *actual* users vote with their clicks to make successful. Innovative, popular, and usable web applications like Amazon.com, Flickr, Craigslist, eBay, Google's Gmail, or the applications built by 37Signals are nowhere to be found. These applications are successful because they embrace the constraints imposed by the web and HTML (and their strengths), and find ways to support users' tasks that make sense in that environment..

It's not every <br />day to find a treatment of sexual identity in what I initially thought <br />of as \\"comics\\". I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />While the plot is simple in theory, and it does seem to be bald-faced <br />in volume one, the author  compensates by throwing the reader into the <br />middle of dynamic situations from the first page, leaving you <br />scrambling momentarily to figure out just where you are. You'll have <br />to look carefully to catch all the subtle reactions flickering across <br />the character's faces, the passing looks of annoyance or <br />embarrassment. It's surprisingly easy to find yourself carried along <br />with the text and miss some of the graphic element. <br /> <br />I liked the body styles and exaggerations. It was almost like being in <br />the characters head, while still standing as a viewer outside the <br />frame. While some readers may prefer a constant outside viewpoint, <br />reading through \\"Steady Beat\\" a third time still carries layers of <br />communication between the character and the reader (and character to <br />character) that reaches beyond the sometimes extreme contortions of <br />shock the main character finds herself in. <br /> <br />There's an obvious element to Rivkah's personality that transcends her <br />art, evident in tiny asides throughout Steady Beat, visual metaphors <br />and analogies, and unabashed vision. While this first effort from the <br />writer/artist does show opportunities for growth, the fact is this is <br />the beginning of a story that's sure to be riveting. There's soul <br />here, real art. It's definitely earned a place on my shelf <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

The cd that you get with it is very useful, as you can begin writing and testing programs right away.  <br /> <br />The main disadvantage of this book is that it does not contain any information on the Standard Template Library. However, I think that it is a very good idea for a beginner to start using the STL from early on instead of treating it as an \\"advanced\\" subject and leaving it for later. It is a very important part of the language and provides you with tools that make your coding life much easier. I believe that an early introduction to it would surely help you approach this relatively difficult programming language with greater optimism. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this tutorial is good, but don't expect to combine it with a reference book and cover all your C++ needs - you will need an STL tutorial as well...	2005-10-09

There are so many dynamics going on in the show (such as short term goals, i.e. winning the assignment; relating to team members; and of course dealing with The Donald, and his side kicks George and Carolyn), that makes it compelling viewing all around. Don't underestimate the Donald's factor. For proof, check the oh-so-lame new Martha Stewart Apprentice show.... boring!!!<br /><br />\\"Lessons from the Apprentice: Secrets to Success from the Boardroom to the Business World\\" (176 pages) is a high-end, glossy page book that takes you back to the first 3 seasons of \\"The Apprentice\\". While the book is structured to offer \\"lessons\\", it really is a fun look back of what worked and what went horribly wrong in the teams various assignments. With 20-20 vision, many of the mistakes that the losing teams made were so obvious (Ivana dropping her pants to \\"sell\\" chocolate bars? Danny's \\"Triple Play\\" act to get people into Burger King? etc.). There are plenty of pictures and quotes from the Donald, George and Carolyn, but also from the various business executives whose company products were on the line, and in that sense, yes, the book offers lessons.<br /><br />In the end, though, this is an irreverent look back at the first three seasons of \\"The Apprentice\\", and a good one at that.

Deceptive in its simplicity, it is a story built around a flawed human being and a teetering socio-economic system, as well as one that is layered with profound themes. The cadence of the author's writing is also of note, as it rhythmically lends itself to the telling of the story, giving it a very distinct voice. No doubt the author's writing style was influenced by her own immersion in Chinese culture, as she grew up and lived in China, the daughter of missionaries.<br /><br />This is the story of the cyclical nature of life, of the passions and desires that motivate a human being, of good and evil, and of the desire to survive and thrive against great odds. It begins with the story of an illiterate, poor, peasant farmer, Wang Lung, who ventures from the rural countryside and goes to town to the great house of Hwang to obtain a bride from those among the rank of slave. There, he is given the slave O-lan as his bride.<br /><br />Selfless, hardworking, and a bearer of sons, the plain-faced O-lan supports Wang Lung's veneration of the land and his desire to acquire more land. She stays with him through thick and thin, through famine and very lean times, working alongside him on the land, making great sacrifices, and raising his children. As a family, they weather the tumultuousness of pre-revolutionary China in the 1920s, only to find themselves the recipient of riches beyond their dreams. At the first opportunity, they buy land from the great house of Hwang, whose expenses appear to be exceeding their income.<br /><br />With the passing of time, Wang Lung buys more and more land from the house of Hwang, until he owns it all, as his veneration of the land is always paramount. With O-lan at this side, his family continues to prosper. His life becomes more complicated, however, the richer he gets. Wang Lung then commits a life-changing act that pierces O-lan's heart in the most profoundly heartbreaking way.<br /><br />As the years pass, his sons become educated and literate, and the family continues to prosper. With the great house of Hwang on the skids, an opportunity to buy their house, the very same house from where he had fetched O-lan many years ago, becomes available. Pressed upon to buy that house by his sons, who do not share Wang Lung's veneration for the land and rural life, he buys the house. The country mice now have become city mice.<br /><br />This is a potent, thematically complex story, brimming with irony, yet simply told against a framework of mounting social change. It is a story that stands as a parable in many ways and is one that certainly should be read. It illustrates the timeless dichotomy between the young and the old, the old and the new, and the rich and the poor. It is no wonder that this beautifully written book won a Pulitzer Prize and is considered a classic masterpiece.

Hi there,    If your thinking of buying this book, please stop and think again as this book has been written with the backing and influence from the current Chinese Communist Party or CCP.      Please ask yourself why would a Communist Run Government like the the one in China would sponsor such a book?    We all know and are aware of what any Communist regeime is all about?  We know and history also supports this that past and present Communist Parties are all about holding power at all costs.  They'll do anything to hold power by surpressing those who can dethrone them, like a country's population, the people.      The CCP is the last strong hold of communism in the world today. Like other former Communist parties that has existed, ie) the former Soviet Union, they will do anything to hold power.      Josif Stalin's gulags incarcerated 12 or so million of Soviet citizens at the time simply because they had a different view from Stalin and the Soviet Communist Party.      Currently in North Korea, their population is starving with a shortage of food but that doesnt stop the North Korean Communist Party from spending million's on the millitary & the Chinese Communist Party is no different.      Please ask yourself how would you feel if your Federal Government conducted themselves in this fashion?      The CCP is no different and have what called the Laogai or Force Labour Camp Network systems whom they use as a tool to persecute those who oppose Chinese Communist Party.  Falun Gong is one practice that is currently being persecuted, Christianity is another one, democractic followers and beleivers are also persecuted in China by the CCP.    I would consider reading the \\"The Nine Commentaries of the Chinese Communist Party\\".  This book is very well written and will provide you with not only a good understanding of CCP policies and practices but provides the truth of CCP history since Chairman Mao came into charge.  Never has a book been available to the public revealing such information and is really worth the read.    [...]    To provide you with a breif; Falun Gong has 5 different meditation excercises as its excercise base and a moral code of being \\"truth, kind and tolerant\\".  In my mind, this can only be a good thing for society.      I wish you well.	2005-10-09

I found it impressive because the concepts is based on using body language to tell when girls are interested as well as when they are ready to go home with you. <br /> <br />Morever, I like the book because it showed me how to complete avoid rejection when approaching, talking to, and closing on girls.   <br /> <br />I bought the book about three weeks ago and I took home a hot girl last night.  I almost gave up after a couple weeks of trying to identify 'A' girls with eye contact.

Not for lack of trying but this is just not one of my strong points.  I read some other books and took a class but it just didn't work for me. <br /> <br />We're having dinner later so I can't wait to see if I'll be able to get her in bed again tonight.  I can't recommend this book enough for guys who have trouble getting girls to have sex with them.  It certainly works for me. <br />	2005-10-09

Tales of cannibalism and other kinds of deprivation make the rest of us grateful to be living in the modern era.  Lewis Keseberg has Sioux burial robes.  He is told by George Donner to give them back.  It is feared the Indians will demand retribution.  Keseberg has imperiled the safety of everyone.   <br /> <br />Jim Reed does not remember Ireland at all, but he remembers crossing the Atlantic.  Jim and his wife read about California and it sounded too good to be true.  Game is scarcer the higher the party climbs.  Tempers are tested.  Reed kills Snyder and suffers banishment from the group.  Reed is given a young man as a companion to cross the desert.   <br /> <br />Fort Laramie is a sort of outpost of civilization.  Where Laramie Creek spills into the Platte it looks like a park.  Half way across the Rockies the Donner Party takes the southern route.  Near the Humboldt Sink the Reed draft animals give way to exhaustion.  The Reed provisions are loaded into the Graves family wagons.   <br /> <br />Except for berries and wild onions, Jim Reed and his companion, Walter, are out of food when they set out from Truckee Meadows.  Walter wants to shoot a horse.  (Snyder was killed because Reed was furious with him for abusing animals.)  Charlie Stanton and  McCutcheon find them.  Walter is too sick to travel.  He is taken in by an Illinois family.  Jim goes off with two traveling men.  It has been ten weeks since Jim left Fort Bridger.   <br /> <br />Coming overland the Johnson cabin is the first stop.  Land costs less than a penny an acre.  Jim arrives at Captain John Sutter's place.  He explains that his wife and children are suffering in the mountains.  Supplies have run low.  McCutcheon arives.   <br /> <br />The Donner Party, traveling, is isolated.  The party has turned into a scattering of wagons and there is the snow.  The Summit Trail is too deep in snow for the oxen.  Jim and others start out on a rescue mission.  They have to turn back.  Sutter is moved by the gall and the plight of the two men, Reed and McCutcheon, the husbands.  McCutcheon sets out for Sonoma to seek the help of ranchers there.  It is known in the area that the Donner Party was the last group to set out that year.   <br /> <br />The Donner Party reached the Summit Trail twenty four hours too late.  People in the party moved into cabins.  When snow went up to the roofs there was not more hunting and there was no more game to eat.  There was no leader because George Donner was five miles back.  A snowshoed party of fourteen people left Donner Lake to try to get through the pass.  Hunger has no boundaries.  The Reed party at the lake suffered hunger.   <br /> <br />Belatedly four rescue teams arrived at the behest of Jim Reed and Bill McCutcheon.  The Reed family survived the ordeal entire, an unusual result.  This is a good retelling of the Donner Party tragedy.	2005-10-09

There are blank spots on pages 24 and 29 of the paperback edition. There is also a slight ink stain on page 398. I checked another copy of this same book (ICC Ephesians paperback) and found those defects on the same exact pages. I suspect that the masterfilm was defected. The hardcover edition that I loaned from a library did not have those defects (It was a beautiful book to hold and read). I also have bought other ICC paperbacks (all three vols of Matt. and also the Pastoral Epistles) and I don't find any defects in those volumes. On the whole, I think the quality of the paperback editions of ICC Ephesians is sadly way too far below the quality of the writer of this otherwise excellent commentary (I'd gladly rate this book 5 stars, but for the reasons stated above). You should check your copy.	2005-10-09

Frederick Douglass is the complete ressurection of the saying, \\"Knowledge is Power.\\"  With the more information he aquired as a slave the more he lusted for freedom.  He also provides an excellent example of what black people in this country could do for themselves, interms of their economical status. Looking further, Douglass loved to think and imagine the endless possiblities, while he was still in bondage physically.  When he began to read and understand the \\"Hypocrasy\\" that this country was based on, using christianity as it main tool, and what every human should be allowed by right, this released his psychological enslavement.  If blacks throughout this country could read and understand there were blacks that went through worse situatians and overcame them, and the current situation that destroy the black communities were created for them to fail, just like slavery, many would wake up and take on the mask of Douglass.  The mask that says, \\"regardless of class, race, or creed, this world was created for everyone to enjoy including me.\\"	2005-10-09

The story is told through the eyes of a child, and just as the narrator's innocence and sense of wonder are lost forever as he comes to understand the violent nature of all that is happening around him, so it goes with the city as a whole, which also loses something irrevocable as it is wrenched from its sleepy, timeless existence into the chaotic modern world. <br /> <br />     The choice to use a child narrator heightens the sense of immense change that the city is undergoing, for this child sees the city's buildings, streets, and bridges as living entities which shift and move and change their mood from day to day, one day seeming to offer firm comfort and shelter, and the next seeming menacing and hazardous, depending on the weather, the attitude of the people around him, the relative brutality of the occupying army, and the intensity and closeness of the bombing campaign.  In the stone facades, steep winding streets, and rain-streaked rooftops of the city, the narrator personifies the desires and sufferings of his people, but he does so unselfconsciously, for he is merely reporting what he sees and feels, because for him the city really is alive.   <br /> <br />     As a child, he is also able to report what he sees with a peculiar mix of detachment and awe that would not be possible from an adult.  When the city is bombed, the emotion he feels above any other is pride in the fact that his house, as one of the biggest and strongest in his neighborhood, is chosen as a bomb shelter.  For him, the bombings, as well as the occupation of the city by the Italian army, are simply facts of life - just the way things are and always have been for him - and he doesn't always understand the anger and bitterness of the adults around him. <br /> <br />     There are many things to admire in this novel, but what I admire most, I think, is the way Kadare unfolds the story and conveys the grand scale of the tragedy but manages to do so in a way that is very personal and easy to connect to.  He conveys character very effectively and economically-- with a few sentences of dialog, he gives us a very clear picture of the family and neighbors of the narrator, their individual quirks of personality and beliefs, as well as what the narrator thinks of them.  He also disperses throughout the narrative brief fragments of a chronicle of the city, as written by one of its eccentric residents, and this interwoven chronicle lends a greater sense of the historical context of the events as they unfold.  As the chronicle gradually becomes less and less coherent, we become aware of the effects of the chaotic violence on the mind of the chronicler, and by extension, the minds and hearts of everyone in the city.   <br /> <br />     By the end of the narrative, the child has seen many horrific things, but has also known many small joys and wonders.  This story reminds us of the incredible brutality that humans are capable of, as well as the openness and compassion to which we should aspire.	2005-10-09

I started out reading the Dakotah Treasures series a couple of years ago.  It started with Ruby, then Pearl.  I really liked the first 2 books.  I liked following sisters Ruby and Opal as they tried to make a decent life in a less than decent environment.  When they thought they had inherited a hotel and found out it was a house for \\"soiled doves\\" it was really fun and interesting to watch the antics of trying to make the Dove House into a decent establishment.  Belle added a lot of trouble for Ruby by her influence on little Opal.  I even like when Pearl came on the scene.  However, with the 3rd book, Opal, it was all downhill from there.  Opal's book was totally boring and could have been added as a couple of chapters to the final book, Amethyst.  There wasn't anything really new or useful in it.  Opal's age didn't really progress that much either.  It started creeping me out when the minister was interested in her --  she was only 14 years old!  I think the minister was in his mid-twenties.  In the final book, Amethyst, the minister is still after Opal and I just couldn't get past the age thing.  I know back in the 1800's it was acceptable, maybe?  But it just kept creeping me out!  Amethyst's character was very boring and had nothing new to add to the series.  I think this series went about 2 books too long.  The author should have brought Belle back to spice things up again.  At least she finally let Opal marry the minister - at barely age 16.  I would not recommend this book.  I only read it because I had read the first 3 and had to follow it through.  The first two books in the series were the best.  I'd recommend them, but then stop.  The other two weren't really that enlightening or exciting.	2005-10-09

His writing is a fresh approach to the fantasy genre, artfully blending the backdrop of a mythical and magical world with characters that have modern day foibles, short comings, and strengths.  His very readable style makes the books hard to put down.  My only complaint is that they are so good, that I burn through his books faster than I can afford to buy them.  He is a real treat for anyone who likes a tongue-in-cheek approach to fantasy.	2005-10-09

I am an avid reader and looked forward to THE EZEKIEL OPTION, having read Mr. Rosenberg's other two novels.  However, this one is very different and not written in the same vein as the other two, even though this is a continuation. <br />The overtly pentecostal Christian overtones were a bit much for me [ and yes I am a practicing Christian].  Mr. Rosenberg has changed publishers with this one - now using the same one as the LEFT BEHIND series.

Passionate Dialogues is a book well worth reading even though Mel Gibson's film came out some time ago. The articles in this book highlight many reasons why we, Christians and Jews, should not let the flurry of conversations and opinions and feeling that the movie sparked die out. The editors did a great job of pulling together a rich array of perspectives that dig deeply into everything from film making to the war on terror and Biblical scholarship. <br /> <br />These are my comments, section by section: <br /> <br />Historical perspecitives: <br />Denova's article is a trove of clear and concise information culled from extra-Biblical sources. She uses this scholarship to help inform us of Gibson' manipulation of the Passion Narrative. She shows us that his primary focus on who was responsible for Christ's death overshadows the very real tragedy of Jesus' betrayal by all. She makes a compelling argument that Gibson's film is unfortunate because its portrayal of Jesus' death as atoning sacrifice continues what J. D. Crossan calls the \\"largest lie\\" in Christianity. <br /> <br />Richard Miller's article continues on with the atonement. His quite original work compares Gibson's traditional portrayal as Jesus as victim - an atoning, universal sacrifice for sin, with an older tradition culled from 2 and 4 Maccabees and other Hellenistic sources. His argument that Jesus, following a strong theological and historical precedent for martyrdom in his own time, determined to attain martrydom to foment a radical change, is meticulous and compelling. <br /> <br />Anne Brannen's article points to a place that I identified with strongly as I watched the movie - there was no point of contact for me to implicate myself into Christ's passion as a perpetrator. She describes a medieval resource that Gibson overlooked in his medieval treatment of the story: The York play \\"Crucifixtion.\\" Using the perspective present in this play, people would have been drawn into the realization of their own sin and redemption, much like a modern day David Mamet play can do for an audience today. <br /> <br />In \\"From Stage to Screen,\\" Ziva Piltch discusses quite well the translation of the somewhat parallel tradition of medieval Passion Plays to the genre of film Her analysis is very thought provoking. I found myself fascinated by her revelations about how film direction, editing and photography moves us in ways that are more limiting than the techniques of the medieval playwrights. Her insights into anti-semitism in Gibson's film are key and exacting. <br /> <br />Dorothy Chansky's easily accessible article is a great look at the more homespun modern passion plays in North America. I appreciate her bias completely. Especially good are her observations that when these plays are \\"preaching to the choir\\" their underlying purpose of conversion, like Gibson's film, marginalizes anyone from outside the community. She makes the point that theater can be used to critique and reinvent stereotypes such as the evil Jews or a Caucasian Jesus. Gibson wasted this opportunity. <br /> <br />Literary perspectives: <br />Ray Keck's literary analysis is inventive and powerful. He sees a certain awful beauty in the violent portrayal of the sacrifice of Christ in Gibson's movie. Mentioning several Spanish authors and works - Lorca and Miro - he identifies the Passion of Christ as a modern day metonymy for the state of our world today. Much as \\"the bottle\\" has become a metonym for the disease of alcholism - Christ's passion has become a metonym for our reality. <br /> <br />In a dialogue with the writings of Flannery O'Connor, Williams does a beautiful job of upholding Gibson's portrayal of Satan and the ongoing battle between him and Jesus. Using the vehicle of transubstantiation, he makes a case for placing Gibson's vision on par with great literature. This disturbs me because he fails to see, I think, Gibson's failed attempt to \\"present violence s a vehicle to understanding the world.\\" (p. 120) I wonder if Gibson's personified Satan does anything except place our own hands on the mallet and nails (as Gibson claims.) <br /> <br />In the article \\"What Gibson Really Meant\\", Wilhelm Wurzer seems to echo things that preachers, probably even including Jesus, have long known: \\"the real spirit of Gibson's film is not limited to ... the various incidents... on screen.\\" (p. 137). I think what \\"Wurzer really meant\\", but never says, is that the Holy Spirit can be relied upon to allow a picture of Jesus that is alive and in the world, inspite of Gibson's alternative purposes. This unlimited quality, along with the masterful cinematography and score lead Wurzer to dub the movie a \\"work of art.\\" <br /> <br />Sarah Haeglin examines Gibson's cinematic decisons and declares that his intense scrutiny and portrayal of the scourging of Jesus is an ethical failure. She argues convincingly that his flashback technique - cutting violence with loving moments with the women - subverts the message of Christ and the mystery of salvation by shifting the historic theology of the cross to the theology of the whip. <br /> <br />Psychoanalytic perspectives: <br />Don Carveth take on Gibson's film claiming that its violent picture of Jesus' death supports a less evolved understanding of the atonement - limiting it to the substitutionary model. He recognizes a more \\"advanced\\" understanding of the atonement (that I like except for the hiearchy he attributes to it.) This is one that allows good and evil to be experienced and held in tension with one another. He, therefore, judges Gibson's film to be narrow and primitive by supporting a view of Christianity that denies many of its central truths and paradoxes. <br /> <br />Philip Gundersn sees Gibson's film as another voice in the \\"language of sacrifice\\" (p. 180) that has taken over in neo-conservative rhetoric since 9/11. He argues rather brilliantly that the old Freudian model of psycho-sexual development, wherein we sacrificepleasure for delayed gratification at some stage in our lives, is played out in extreme in this film. This same CHOICE for sacrifice is being called for in the war on terror by the power that be today. <br /> <br />Britton Johnston's argument that Gibson portrays Jesus as the ultimate Lethal Weapon is compelling. Using the anthropological/literary work of Rene Girard, Johnston shows that Gibson's work totally reverses and undoes the hopeful message of the whole Bible - that humanity can say NO to its ancient and mythic patterns of scape-goating as opposed to grace and mercy. <br /> <br />Interfaith Perspective: <br />David Shtulman write a very well balanced article on how Gibson's film provides a teachable moment for Jewish/Christian relationships. He highlights the progress of this reconciliation starting with Vatican II. And, while not ignoring the anti-Semitic aspects of the film, he cautions Jews not to over react or expect to tell Christians how to tell their own story. <br /> <br />Daniel Burston finishes the collection with an article that takes us back to the beginning articles. He cautions Christians to deepen their understanding of why Jews don't necessarily appreciate the universalism of humanity's culpability for the death of Jesus. He feels that Gibson's movie is an anachronism that has reversed the ideal of a vibrant and humane religious pluralism\\" (p. 239) He also outlines, with brave honesty, what he sees as a \\"Faustian bargain\\" that exists between Evangelicals and Israeli Jews and also between more mainline factions of both faiths as we band together against the Muslims. His discussion of original sin was eye-opening. <br />	2005-10-09

I say from Hef because he's listed as the author, though \\"and Bill Zehme\\" presumably did most of the writing, organizing, interviewing, and editing. <br /> <br />However, given its parameters, the book works surprisingly well.  Zehme did a similar book - a better one, though - on Sinatra a few years back, and its organization by subject/theme, its adoring fifties-style prose and please-pass-on-your-wisdom-o-master tone which strangely enough worked very well on the Sinatra piece is used again here.  It's sort of effective.  The book is a mixture of Zehme's narrative in the above voice, quotes from Hefner mixed in, and dozens of excellent photos of all types. <br /> <br />Hef passes on pearls of wisdom regarding women, romance, enjoying life and games, business, sex and the like.  The Bed is covered in detail, with blueprints and everything.  Much of it is not especially deep or new or earthshattering.  I don't know that it really touches on what makes Hef such a fascinating figure or so important a man in 20th century life.  But it's not uninteresting to Hefner aficionados. <br /> <br />What is in fact the goods on Hef is that he managed to first define the upscale male fantasy life, and then proceeded to insert himself into the picture and live it, for fifty nonstop years of uncompromising hedonism.  In doing so he became a living symbol of the sexual revolution, and in the magazine's Playboy Philosophy he defended and explained his thinking brilliantly.  It could not have worked without tremendous charm, business acumen (including the knowledge of when to step down from day-to-day operating control and let more capable managers take over), and self-control exercised over himself, and he surely kept very good people watching his back.   <br /> <br />This book doesn't tell that story.  If interested, there are many out there that do; I particularily like Russell Miller's Bunny, from back in the troublesome 80s.  But this book does have fantastic and rarely seen photos from the 50s, 60s and 70s which make up for a lot, and one does get a faint glimpse of an unusual man.	2005-10-09

I found this book sandwiched between Vogue and Cosmo while I was getting my nails manicured in Georgetown.  What an beautiful discovery in a most unlikely setting!  I left a large tip and took the book with me.      Shan Sa's short novel explores love through characters who defy politics, gender roles, and even traditional love stories.   Many books written about Manchuria during the time of japanese expansionism seek to reveal the tragedy of the times by villifying the japanese invaders or victimizing the chinese invadees.  This book does neither; rather it portrays the pain and desperation of humans trying to be human in an inhuman setting of war and nationalism.      I imagine that Sa's book is breathtaking in its French original, but even as a translation I thought it was delicate and poetic.	2005-10-09

Well, my skepticism was destroyed after about 15 minutes of reading this book. Not only is the author a veteran of the war, his style is SO engrossing I didn't stop reading until I finished the entire book! <br /> <br />The amount of details that are in the narritive can only come from someone who participated in the historical events that are narrated. Zola's characters are easy to identify with, and anyone can pick one character and say \\"yeah, that's me\\" as they read the story.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in the F/P War or French/European culture/life of the Second Empire.

Everything begins when Billy's breathe sets of the sprinklers in the men's room. That night when he gets home he is told his dad is a dragon in human form. Billy is pretty floored at this news but gets little chance to react because then he meets a girl who's mother was a dragon. Then the two of them find out about the black knights who are bent on wiping out all dragons, and there is one of them nearby.<br /><br />This is a pretty good book; I don't usually read Christian fiction mostly because of the lack of good stuff. This book was very good and I am very glad I found it. This book was very original, well written, the characters were good and 3D. It was, in that way, pretty much like a better average fantasy. But there were many things that made it above average, it was quite deep, the characters were good Christians.  But however be warned, this book refers to Merlin as a great prophet, now in old manuscripts Merlin is referred to as many different things, one of witch, a prophet. I think Davis's use of that in his story was creative, but I would think a Christian would not do something like that. God speaks strongly against false prophets so a prophet, even in a fantasy book, should not be taken lightly. I really think that prophets and prophesies should not be used in fiction; however that is just my personal conviction. One thing lots of people complain about is the language, I did not find it overly fancy but some of the things the bully at school says are a little fancy. The language is defiantly not a problem and I must point out that not all teens use slang and bad grammar.<br /><br />I would probably recommend this book, but I would say, because it is Christian fiction, be wary as you are reading it, for you would not want to be led astray by anything false that might be in it.	2005-10-09

The title and cover caught my attention, but the first chapter proved that Melanie Wells could deliver.  Dylan comes face to face with a strange, pale, scarred man; her mother's engagement ring reappears from the grave; and the story takes off from there.<br /><br />Throughout this chilling tale, Wells lightens the mood through her character's wry humor.  I'd love to meet Dylan Thomas again in a sequel.  She's strong and independent, yet susceptible to a bit of romance and spiritual wrestling.  She's not religious, but she believes in a personal God.  The biblical ideas presented here are clear and sound, without being too preachy.  Some reviewers seemed to want more direct answers at the conclusion, while I appreciated the author's decision to leave some things for interpretation.  Life isn't always black and white, easily defined, nicely wrapped in a box.<br /><br />If you like Dean Koontz or Frank Peretti, you'll find a lot to like here.  Yet this book stands on its own two feet, original, with a female perspective, and perfectly paced.  I hope Melanie Wells is working on the next one, because \\"When the Day of Evil Comes\\" ranks as one of my favorite thrillers this year--and one of the best Christian thrillers ever.<br /><br />***With some of the shady things I've seen in reviews recently, I must add: I've never met, communicated with, or received any compensation from this author.	2005-10-09

I think the reason many people found Graham's writing so clear is that in comparison to many business texts, it doesn't use fluffy business speak that's just too common.  However, the writing is on the same level as reading an obscure manual on repairing televisions.  It assumes a certain type of audience.<br /><br />Undeniably, Graham's original examples are harder to relate to, because the mentioned companies don't have as much ring to them as say Zweig's examples.  It's argued that the examples are timeless, so being outdated shouldn't matter.  However, it's harder to see the timelessness if the reader can't relate to the companies.  Zweig's commentary is very useful, because it takes an interpretive approach to modern examples helping to illustrate Graham's principles.<br /><br />Despite my criticisms, I still have high respect for this book.  Mr. Market, Margin of Safety, Intrinsic Value, Portfolio Allocation, and much more are lessons every reader should acquire from the book.  Afterwards, the knowledge from such a text should help the reader develop a stronger investment strategy/philosophy.	2005-10-09

That was more than twenty years ago. I then paid more attention to the things themselves through rigorous analysis rather than relying intuitively on fanciful images that have a vague, questionable, kinship with these things.<br /><br />In evolving so, I increasingly showed a typical prejudice of the Western, rational mind. I turned my back on all manner of mythological narratives where intuition and imagination share the same bed and beget strange, perplexing mental creations, open to a multitude of interpretations. Admittedly, this prejudice is warranted to the extent that purely rational or factual accounts that relate clear, if limited, realities with words directly appropriate to these realities are more intelligible and reliable. Having said this, it can become a serious impediment in the study of so-called primitive cultures. Their wisdom is an indiscriminate blend of profound truths, rooted in experience (sometimes expanded by psychoactive agents found in certain plants), and quirky anthropomorphic projections or poetic assimilations.<br /><br />Open-mindedness here implies a renewed tolerance toward fanciful myths to rediscover the truth hidden in them, as that of ancient mythologies.<br /><br />The Cosmic Serpent by Jeremy Narby - a brilliantly written and solidly documented book that is a pleasant read into the bargain - is an invitation to reunite with our intuitive, imaginative self and conciliate it with our Western, rational mind.<br /><br />Likewise, in my own intellectual journey, I have finally chosen to be not a philosopher (fond of the scientific method) instead of a poet, in the name of reason and clarity, but both a philosopher and a poet. Reality is indeed best apprehended by means of all our mental faculties: mnemonic, associative, intuitive, imaginative, conceptive or other.<br /><br />Having said this, Jeremy Narby in the Cosmic Serpent goes further than other anthropologists who strive to salvage the old myths by showing their secret relevancy to the real world. In establishing a connection between intertwined cosmic serpents as the universal principle of life (which is a foundational element of the so-called primitive knowledge) and the DNA double helix (which is the prized discovery of our scientific age), he opens a door that some may never have imagined even existed. Is the world truly animistic, where everything down to the smallest thing has a spirit? Thanks to some special training or special psychoactive agents, can humans, who are preeminently spiritual beings, communicate with the spirits of such large molecules as DNA molecules and through this process learn from and about them? Shamans apparently do. This would account for their knowledge of these molecules, represented metaphorically by intertwined cosmic serpents (or such like imagery as a cosmic ladder), outside the arena of science.<br /><br />Let me conclude with a recommendation: read this book.

Even though I haven't read the English translation, I can say that the original is one of the best books I've read... and, being a Comparative Literature major, I've read quite a few. <br /> <br />Like me, I'm sure you'll find yourself immersed in the story of this novel, and become part of the seemingly real narrative lives of its characters.  Vita and Diamante, the novel's protagonists, are two of the countless Italian immigrant children who are sent to New York at the turn of the 20th century in search of a better life in America.  Their story is one of courage, love, betrayal, of loss and dissapointemnt, but it's a story with which all immigrants will identify on some level.  Each of us can identify with the break from the past in search for something better and the many losses experienced along the way.    <br /> <br />At times Mazzucco interrupts the flow of her story  by recounting her own experiences as she researched the history of her family - the subject of the novel.  By doing so, she is able to create a link between her life and the life of her characters, between historical facts and the author's fictitious renditions of them and, most importantly, between past and present.   <br /> <br />VITA is the story of an amazingly courageous woman, the story of her LIFE and of the continuous struggle that is LIFE.  A great story is one which forces us to look deeper into our own lives and contemplate our past experiences, and 'Vita' does just that.	2005-10-09

They meet for the first time when Jim is ten years old and Antonia is fourteen. Recently orphaned, Jim has moved to the Great Prairie to live with his grandparents in Nebraska. Antonia, on the other hand, has been wrenched from her homeland in Bohemia, emigrating with her parents to the United States and finding herself in Nebraska. Jim and Antonia's chance encounter on a train sets the stage for the forging of a friendship and unconditional love that time will not diminish.<br /><br />The book relates the harshness of immigrant life through the eyes of Jim, who narrates the events contained in the book. There is a relentless stoicism about the book, which is written in spare, clear prose. With intense imagery and descriptive exactitude, late nineteenth century Nebraska comes to life. It also relates the paths that each of the characters choose to follow, as well as the vicissitudes of life that mold and shape them in ways that no one would have imagined.<br /><br />The focus of the book, which is also a coming of age tale, seems to be on the female characters and their strengths. All the women in it seem to be survivors, despite the hardships that they encounter. This is, without a doubt, a life affirming book, wrought with great feeling and a decided sense of time and place. Yet, despite its poignancy, the book is surprisingly unsentimental and straightforward. It is a testament to the author's literary talent that this book has emerged as a timeless classic. Bravo!t this book has emerged as a timeless classic. Bravo!	2005-10-09

In Robert Greer's latest novel, bail bondsman CJ Floyd journeys down \\"Memory Lane\\" to revisit the atrocities of the Viet Nam conflict.  CJ is retained by a recently engaged Amerasian, to locate her father, Langston Blue, who has sequestered himself in the remote hills of West Virginia after his discharge from the Army nearly 35 years before. Coincidentally, a botched assassination attempt on Blue's life forces him to Denver to attempt to locate his long-lost daughter at around the same time that the city mourns the recent murder of a popular congressman.<br /><br />Floyd quickly discovers that the dead congressman is Blue's former squad leader from his old Army unit.  The plot thickens when the police connect Blue to the murder.  Floyd's role turns defensive as he searches for clues to prove Blue's innocence and discovers evidence of political corruption, covert military death squads, shady journalism, and suspicions of ethnic cleansing.  The plot is further complicated by conflicts in Floyd's romantic relationship with long-time girlfriend, Mavis, his desire to retire, and a vengeful ex-convict who blames Floyd for her brother's death and is out to exact her revenge on Floyd and his loved ones.<br /><br />This was my first time reading a CJ Floyd mystery and I found the story to be engaging and suspenseful; albeit a bit lengthy and heavy on dialogue.  Nonetheless, I think fans of the series will be delighted with this offering.<br /><br />(...)	2005-10-09

A technology for male-female communication and seduction?  Yes, indeed it IS true, as I will verify later.  The details of that technology are NOT the subject for Strauss's (aka Style's) book but any intelligent person with a set of testicles can fill in many of the blanks.  Nevertheless, pickup and seduction technology are definitely NOT the subject of the book.  Strauss is giving the reader just what the title implies a panoramic and at times excruciatingly detailed look at \\"The Game\\" while profoundly penetrating the heretofore secret society of PUAs (pick-up artists).  Style (Strauss' psuedonym as a revered member of the society)is not only a good writer but also an excellent student and fairly rapidly goes from being wimpusdeluxus #1 on the planet to being voted #1 PUA by the members of the loosely-held together secret society of PUA's not just once but in two consecutive years.  But Style's intelligence and compassion and knack for revealing the agonizing blemishes in his own life propel this expose` to the highest place on the shelf.  The last third of the book must have been difficult for him to live through and were tough on the reader's emotions as well.  After documenting the power of PUA skills to bring vast pervasive benefit to all areas of a man's life . . . we are shown a brutal critique of the destructive power of obsession to bring any man or group, however well-intentioned, to the abyss.  Great work!  Oh, my son is one of the PUAs for Real Social Dynamics mentioned in the book about six times and he gets both the thumbs up and the thumbs down from Style, and all events within the book jive 100% with reality.	2005-10-09

US	50230169	RHEIK2HKOGII9	0060390077	155016639	America in Search of Itself: The Making of the President, 1956-1980	Books	4	13	13	N	N	A Classic's Last Round	Where is this generation's Theodore H. White? Where is the person who can write the history of a fresh presidential election cycle without alienating nearly half those who care enough to read it? Where is the scribe who can lead an anxious electorate back to its golden mean, to contemplate dispassionately on lessons learned, rather than battles lost and won?<br /><br />There's been a huge hole in the writing of contemporaneous political history since White's heyday, when his four \\"Making Of The President\\" books taking in the quadrennial election years 1960 through 1972 could be found on middle-class bookshelves across America without giving away the political leanings of the homeowner. But the hole is not quite as wide as I once thought, after discovering this book in the library. Of a piece with the \\"Making Of\\" series, the title suggests a condensing of 24 years in presidential politics, but really focuses on three elections White didn't cover in his previous histories, in brief those of 1956 and 1976, then, in greater detail, that of 1980.<br /><br />So what you really get here is a \\"Making Of The President 1980\\" with some opening observations on other campaigns. The book doesn't really tie up the whole of White's reporting with a \\"here's-what-I-learned\\" bow, and in that way the title's misleading, though he does offer some wisdom near the end accumulated from his experiences. One that sticks out: \\"Critical elections are not fixed in history by election night returns; they depend on what the victor does with his victory.\\"<br /><br />It was still an open question in early 1982, when this book was published, what Ronald Reagan would do with his 1980 victory. It was a bad spring for the economy, with high unemployment, a nasty recession, and popular unrest at home and abroad over the nuclear buildup Reagan was championing.<br /><br />But one gets a sense of White's sympathies being with Reagan all the same. He may not have understood conservatives, and writes of the anti-abortion movement particularly with deep scorn, but you sense reading White's observations about the 1970s and the election of Jimmy Carter that White's faith in liberalism, so clear in his \\"Making Of The President 1960\\" hagiography of John F. Kennedy, had not just been challenged but routed by the failure of the Great Society, the war in Vietnam, and the culture of complaint that became rooted around the Democratic party.<br /><br />\\"They had set out to free everyone and had created a nation of dependents instead,\\" White writes. Add to that a brittle president (Jimmy Carter) unable to make tough, effective decisions, and you have a clear recipe for change.<br /><br />It wasn't that White was a liberal or a conservative, or even a moderate. It was that he was able to take in all political viewpoints, weigh their respective merits and minuses, and offer in the end something deep and penetrating about what was going on with the nation at the time of any particular election. He had a deep vocabulary, an ear for the telling quote, an eye for vivid detail, but his greatest strength was his open mind.<br /><br />White writes especially well of Carter, his colorful Democratic challengers in 1980, and gets a penetrating interview with Reagan near Election Day where the exhausted candidate can't let go of his Carter attacks. \\"I wonder whether he's confusing some of his own statements with having come from God,\\" Reagan offers. White is more cutting here than in his earlier books, but he takes pains to present all his portraits in sympathetic context, and frankly, his acerbic takes on Carter are very entertaining.<br /><br />It's not a full-blooded \\"Making Of\\" book, and White does test your patience with a lengthy examination of the 1980 census, but given the resounding importance of the 1980 election, it's nice to have White's voice offering commentary one last time, and sad to reflect upon how it has been missed.rly with deep scorn, but you sense reading White's observations about the 1970s and the election of Jimmy Carter that White's faith in liberalism, so clear in his \\"Making Of The President 1960\\" hagiography of John F.

Hitchens is a fine journalist and he compiles some interesting information on Orwell's experiences in Spain, India, and elsewhere, but he rarely provides in-depth political/literary analysis of the man, preferring instead to subject the reader to mildly interesting anecdotes involving various luminaries in the literary/political world. Why Orwell Matters is a minor work, it may interest curious readers who've read 1984 and Animal Farm and would like to know more, but it's far from a serious study.	2005-10-09

It is very straightforward, with directions that seem easy to follow, and many diagrams & photographs to help guide you to a finished product.  It has some beginner, intermediate, and advanced projects, so essentially there is something for anybody who wants to learn about the craft of handmade books.  I wouldn't recommend this for a young crafter -- it's definitely written for a person with at least a small knowledge of paper craft who is looking to expand, and the directions would be too difficult, I think, for anyone younger than high school age.	2005-10-09
