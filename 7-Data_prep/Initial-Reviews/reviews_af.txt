Each chapter was a short story relating Auntie Mame's uncultivated adventure. Auntie Mame was a character that possessed great aptitude of playing totally different parts. She could be sophisticated or downright rude, mawkish or absolutely stern, malicious or wholesomely demure, depending on the situation at hand. The book doesn't need to be read from start to finish. One could pick a chapter to enjoy and would certainly get the gist of Auntie Mame's eccentricity. To read the entire volume is to take pleasure in Patrick Dennis' buoyant creativity.

I am not a virtual assistant, but a graphic artist who has long wanted to work from home. I have heard wonderful things about the authors of The 2-Second Commute and thought that perhaps their book might shed some light on the area of virtual work even if my area of expertise did not (I thought) fall squarely into the \\"traditional\\" virtual assistance model. <br /> <br />As an artist, I am easily bored by business books and most matters of business generally, so I am not what you would call an easy audience. My husband was in shock when he tried to get my attention while I was reading this book and found me holding up my index finger to indicate he should give me \\"just a second\\" before I could reply. Usually, any interruption from a business book would be a welcome diversion! <br /> <br />The authors' style was so comfortable that I felt at once that I was meeting them in person and enjoying a meaningful, yet fun conversation. <br /> <br />I learned so much from this book. About myself, my family, my priorities, my values, and my own best path to self-employment with a business that can embrace and enhance all of these.  <br /> <br />I now have a strategic marketing plan, a target (niche) market, and loads of fabulous marketing advice to help me as I venture into my own virtual career. As the authors advise, I will not quite my day job just yet, but I am so inspired by this book that I know I can accomplish great things! <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to take their \\"job\\" home.  <br /> <br />Judith Polzin	2005-10-11

This book is the first in a series that contain the \\"Black Dagger Brotherhood\\", and let me say that these 'brothers' make fine reading.

I found Part I extremly boring and disappointing. Part I did not strike a bit of intrest in me. Honestly I didn't want to hear about his desire to combined three different religions. I found that irrelevant to Part II and III of the book. Yes there was some relevance but not as much as there should have been, especially since the first Part was about him and his religion. Part II was a hook I found it extremly interesting. Many of the fantasical events in Part II changed my feelings towards the book completly. Pi's story was just amazing. The idea of someone being stuck on a boat for 200 something days with a bengal tiger is fantastic. Survivg in a life boat for that long is incrediable. Who wouldn't want to read about such an amazing story of survival. After Part II I was confident that this book was one of the best I had ever read, then the book eneded terribly. At the very end of the book you are lead to believe that the whole book was a lie. Pi gives you two different stories; the one with suriving on the boat with a tiger and the other one was about him surviving completly on his own, after the murder of three other surviors. I absolutely hated the ending it makes the book almost worthless to read. The ending was so disappointing and it ended leaving you wondering which story was true. The ending allows you to make the story what you want to make it and I honestly hate that. So I give this book a two because of the terrible beginning and ending.	2005-10-11

I guess that singers/songwriters carry over their writing skills to the pages, because I know Gloria writes some of her own music and it's another form of story telling.  Therefore this book is great and being a mother herself, I guess she knew exactly the kind of stories young children love to hear.  I have read this to a little cousin of mine and he was enthralled the whole way through.  Noelle is a cute little character (that is actually one of her real dogs) and it tells a story of all these things that happen to her very interestingly.  The real message is really about the dog having a hard time fitting in and it's a metaphor for kids feeling left out and not included and different.  My cousin also loved all the colors and pictures.  This is a great book that I really recommend parents to read to their kids (and enjoy yourself too).	2005-10-11

Mainly, they blow stuff up and wreck machines, but they have a fun time doing it.<br />In \\"Hayduke Lives!,\\" the sequel to that book, Edward Abbey returns to those characters and tries to stir them up to action once again, this time with the threat of a giant bulldozer about to destroy a beautiful canyon.<br />Yeah....<br />First of all, do not read this until you've read \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\" first.  And even then, think about it carefully before reading this half-formed, rambling, disappointing sequel.<br />I loved \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\"--I've read it multiple times--and so the first fifty pages or so of this were just a lot fun to me, being reunited with the characters from that book.<br />But then, the story never really goes anywhere.  The novel constantly digresses to describe sex scenes or Earth First! rallies, and it's not until page 270(!) of a 307-page novel that the four original members of the Monkey Wrench Gang finally reunite.<br />The book rambles on in an unfocused way that damages the characters that were so nicely formed in the first book, constantly digresses, and ultimately, unfortunately, becomes much more violent than \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang\\" ever did.<br />The writing is occassionally good--sometimes even great--and some of the scenes are exciting, but none of it ever goes anywhere.  There are too many characters and not enough character development, and the whole thing with the bulldozer comes across as lame and cheesy, especially when the first book set up their next goal to be something much bigger and more exciting--the destruction of Glen Canyon Dam.<br />Read this only if you absolutely LOVED \\"The Monkey Wrench Gang,\\" but even then, be warned that this might dampen your enthusiasm even for that book.  It's pretty disappointing, especially coming from an author that we all know was capable of much, much better.le of much, much better.	2005-10-11

I got the book a couple of weeks ago and, except for some skimming through some of the mechanics, have read the entire thing twice and returned to several sections. I kept trying to NOT compare it with the previous incarnation, Mage:The Ascension, but that's impossible. They share the same name, same company, and same ideas, so comparison is inevitable. Something about the whole game and setting bugged me, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Then I read the above review from G. Jensen \\"Belarius\\" that threw the whole thing into focus. <br /> <br />Things I don't like: <br /> <br />- The magickal societies. They're just not interesting or compelling to me at all. The original Mage had nine main societies (the Traditions), five branches of the Technocracy, the Marauders, the Nephandi, and a collection of unaligned groups (Crafts). They were all very diverse culturally, geographically, and magickally, with distinct histories. The new version attempts to cram all the different worldviews of magick into five arbitrary and contrived Orders that all originated in Atlantis and, as mentioned in the above review, all have the exact same \\"post-17th century\\" European occult feel to them. It's as if they made an entire game system based on the Order of Hermes. Only the Mysterium sparked any interest in me, because I like the idea of \\"exploring the dark corners of the Earth\\" and hunting lost lore and artifacts, like a wizardly Indiana Jones. (My favorite Traditions from the old system, btw, were the Cult of Ecstasy, Euthanatos, and Order of Hermes). <br /> <br />- The Order-specific variations on spells (or \\"rotes\\"). They seem to be an unnecessary waste of printing space to me. So what if Silver Ladder mages roll, for example, Wits+Occult+Spirit instead of Perception+Occult+Spirit for a certain rote? Whoop-de-do. I know it was done for flavor, but it tastes pretty bland. <br /> <br />- The symbols of the Arcana (\\"Spheres\\" in the old system). It's a minor point, but the old symbols were much more distinctive, being actual alchemical symbols. The new ones are forgettable. <br /> <br />- The pale gold ink and cursive font used for the rote names, among other things. It's very hard to read. <br /> <br />Things I do like: <br /> <br />- The splitting of the Entropy Sphere of the old system into the Death and Fate Arcana of the new. They were kind of lumped together in old Mage to maintain numerological consistency (9 Traditions, 9 Spheres), but they're different enough to warrant their own categories and magickal effects. <br /> <br />- The Fate Arcanum. A very good treatment of magick that affects luck, destiny, and chance, with a lot more variety than I thought possible from this type of magick. Very interesting read with a lot of gameplay uses. <br /> <br />- Prime, Mana, Tass, and Hallows. One of the most confusing things about the old system for me was the method for regaining Quintessence (now Mana) using Prime magick, Tass, and Nodes (now Hallows). Even after several revisions it still seemed kludgy and unclear. In the new system it all makes sense at last. (Sidenote for anyone who has ever been to Overton Square in Memphis: does this place not feel like a Hallow?) <br /> <br />- Foci. No more need for a different focus for every Sphere, and penalties for not using them. Now it's just a bonus if you DO use one. <br /> <br />I could add lots of things to both lists, but those are the ones that stand out to me the most right now. <br /> <br />I wanted to like the new Mage. I tried to MAKE myself like it, because it's obvious that White Wolf put a lot of effort into this and, well, it's Mage. The production values are great, the mechanics are well thought out and clearer than in the old system, and the whole setting is very cohesive and self-consistent, hence the 3-star review. Unfortunately it's a cohesive, self-consistent setting that leaves me cold, and I find I have no desire to actually even play it. Maybe some homemade fusion of elements from the old setting with the new mechanics would entice me, but the game as written just doesn't.	2005-10-11

Definitely a must-have book for the advanced Japanese learner who needs to learn the Kanji, in addition to just the vocabulary translation.  I often refer to this book just to find out what the kanji for a word is. Not meant to be a pocket dictionary, but a REFERENCE dictionary.    For example, the word raspberry shows in katakana, \\"ki-i-chi-go\\", plus the kanji with the furigana above, plus the common katakana pronunciation \\"ra-zu-be-ri\\".  Therefore, you'll know how to read it in romaji, katakana English, AND kanji with the proper historical Japanese way. PLUS, for many words, especially those with multiple or varied meanings, it will give examples (even full sentences too) in both English and Japanese, with kanji and furigana. Very helpful and INDEPTH meanings for the serious learner!!    The only negative about this book, is that the Japanese to English section is in hiragana (as opposed to romaji).  So to look up a Japanese word, it may be very difficult for beginners to use, unless you already have the hiragana a-i-u-e-o ka-ki-ku-ke-ko down already, plus knowing how to read the hiragana.  For quick look-up (and laziness) I would prefer to look up a Japanese word by the abc alphabet way.    I would say that this is only for the serious Japanese learner with intermediate/advanced capabilities.  If you are simply studying for a Japanese class for a few semesters and are not totally serious, you don't need such in-depth explanations, I would recommend something cheaper and easier to read.  At a regular price of $60, there are much cheaper and much simpler books.	2005-10-11

It also showed me how to attack early in the game.<br /><br />I think it would be of great value to any chess player ranked below USCF 1800.<br /><br />I suspect that the people who gave this book such a terrible rating assume that it's trying to teach people to \\"win quickly.\\" Generally, there is no way to \\"win quickly\\" against a good opponent. So why bother to study these \\"tricks\\" that you will probably never get to use?<br /><br />Well, actually, there is much value in studying them, but you are not studying \\"tricks\\" but learning tactical patterns that can be widely used if your opponent should happen to make an opening mistake.<br /><br />Whenever there is a winning combination available, anywhere in the game, it means that your opponent has made a mistake. Studying tactics is the way to learn to identify the winning combination when a mistake has been made.<br /><br />I think many people study openings hoping to get an advantage over their opponent early in the game. However, studying chess opening \\"lines\\" is just not of much value to someone rated under 2000.<br /><br />Frankly, I think it would be wiser to study and re-study books like this one (or Pandolfini's other opening books called Traps and Zaps and Traps and Zaps 2). As I have already stated, you want to learn how to punish someone if they should happen to make an error, but that doesn't mean you memorize the opening \\"line\\" and hope your opponent makes it. Instead, you learn the PATTERN, so that you will recognize it if an opponent should ever make it.<br /><br />Of course, this is exactly what should be done when studying  tactics in general. We don't try to wait for the identical postition to arise. We just learn the pattern, and then practice identifying it in many different positions.<br /><br />If a player is ranked below USCF 2000, he should spend the bulk of his study time practicing tactics, and this book is one of the best.	2005-10-11

Because of Leo Carey's wry, admiring, melancholy essay in THE NEW YORKER, I grabbed this novel, its prequel, and its sequel when I found them at a local used bookstore, and oh, how I wanted to like them more than I ended up doing. But they're just not as good as the hype. They drift all over the place [to be fair, Carey admitted that devotees of mysteries would find these books too undisciplined], and the narrator's aggressively amoral personality -- imagine P. G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster crossed with Jonathan Gash's Lovejoy -- can wear on one after a while. The plots are made of Swiss cheese, at best, and these books are also sadly dated in their views of women. Maybe it's because I read the Lovejoy books before these -- if I had come to them without knowing about Lovejoy, I would have enjoyed them more.	2005-10-11

The reviewer is a member of the Northern Virginia Ethical Society, a religious Humanist congregation.   <br /> <br />There are so many problems with the book they would be difficult to list.  The bibliography shows the author made unfortunate choices for sources, such as books by fellow evangelicals and conservatives for information about Humanism rather than primary sources or more scholarly texts.  The book has an amazingly incoherent organizational structure.  No scholar himself, Howse stumbles from the introduction, where is mis-defines Humanism, and quickly proceeds downhill from there. <br /> <br />The first chapter scattershots at several minor issues, but the aim point is the claim that America was founded as a Christian nation, and that Liberals and Humanists kicked God out of schools and the public square.  Howse appears not to have understood why our constitution called for secular governance.  This reviewer recommends \\"The Godless Constitution\\" by Isaac Kramnick and R. Laurence Moore to those readers interested in this issue. <br /> <br />The second chapter claims that separation of Church and State is a \\"liberal lie\\" and a modern creation.  Howse claims that states may institute official state religions notwithstanding the Fourteenth Amendment, apparently not considering that possibility that Utah, a Mormon majority state could, under his arguement, mandate all voters to be LDS members.  Howse also seems to believe that Liberals and Humanists initiated most cases involving prayer in schools.  In fact, it has always been religious minorities-Catholics, Jews, Mormons and other devout people who started the cases, and in whose behalf the government has correctly sided.  I direct readers who are interested in this topic to \\"Between Church and State,\\" by James W. Fraser. <br /> <br />The nadir of the book is the next two chapters dealing with Humanism and Liberalism. Howse makes sometimes bizarre assertions, including: true Republicans must be Christians fundamentalists and that Liberals are anti-Christian.  Like many  conspiratorialists, Howse props up both John Dewey and the NEA for exposure as Humanists and Socialists aiming to brainwash children.  These claims are terribly out of date considering the Department of Education and many local school boards are under control of Christian conservatives.   <br /> <br />Then there is a chapter on Evolution, a chapter claiming secular humanism is the state religion, and so on. Edited in a cut-and-paste manner, the sections are oftimes wrong and oftimes not relevant to the topic.    <br /> <br />Howse doesn't know the histories or definitions of Humanism, Liberalism, Marxism, Secularism or any other \\"ism\\" he uses, and therefore conflates one with the other.  All things that are not approved by his evangelical worldview are liberal, or socialistic or secular or humanistic (which he believes are all the same).  Never one to seek out new and better sources, he relies upon Tim LaHaye for much of his history of Humanism.  This is equivalent to using a Wahhabist to explain Judaism. <br /> <br />Howse makes much of the assertion that Humanism is a religion, but like LaHaye, he doesn't understand that there are diverse views on this point even within the Humanist community.  I'm a religious Humanist, part of the Ethical Culture movement that has been recognized as a religion for over one hundred years.  Paul Kurtz is a Secular Humanist. Some Secular Humanists reject the religious connotation, believing religion has only furthered discord, bigotry and prejudice.  Howse has provided more evidence to support their view.  Indeed, it is almost impossible to see how someone who claims to follow the Prince of Peace could have written a book so filled with error and venom.   <br /> <br />If you are an evangelical Christian or a conservative, I do not recommend this book.  It is filled with falsehoods and omissions.  Aside from the books cited in the review, I would recommend \\"The Humanist Way\\" by Edward L. Ericson, or visits to the American Humanist Association website ([...]) and American Ethical Union ([...]  But better yet, find a local Ethical Society or secular humanist group to visit, and talk with its members.  You will not agree with our views, but you will also find people completely different from those depicted in these pages.  We are not your enemies; we are your fellow citizens. <br /> <br />The book contains no photographs, endnotes but no bibliography, four appendices (non useful to the reader and containing errors) and no index.	2005-10-11

Now that I know what chords go together and why, it all makes sense.

I read one review where the guy said it was all hype and that you could buy a book cheaper.  True, cheaper books out there, but they only show chords with nothing about theory, capo placement or experienced guitar tricks.  Too bad that he missed the point.

As you get further into this sick novel you realize that Patrick Bateman is more than just a character, he is a representation, a reflection of all that is wrong with America, all of our national obsessions and hangups: he is materialistic, obsessesed with his looks, and clothes, with his money, he is voilent and sadistic, he is mesmerized by talk shows, fancy restuarants, hot girls, and himself.  <br /> Patrick Bateman represents everything that lurks above and below the surface in American Life. On the surface he is rich, handsome, well educated, successful, fun loving. But underneath he is a madman who engages in every type of sadistic behavior,--rape, torture, animal cruelty, murder, mutliple homicide, cop killing, robbery, cannabalism, ect. <br /> This novel is long and sometimes longwinded but it is redeemed by its powerful statement about our society and culture and Ellis's ability to find humor in even the darkest and sickest parts of the book [ like when Patrick Batement walks around with a decapited head swinging from on his erection after killing and decapitating some poor young woman.) The reader can get bored with all the meticulous description of clothing but you have to realize this was an amazing exercise in writing on the part of Brett Easton Ellis, who is trying to show the shallowness and pretentousness of the narrator and our culture. <br /> All throughout the book Batement tries to tell people that he is a murder but everyone else in the book is just as self centered and self absorbed as he is ---and they either ignore him or misinterpret what he says. Over dinner one night a girl asks him \\"What do you do?\\" and he says \\"Im into murders and executions.\\" which she interprets as \\"Mergers and Acquisitions.\\" <br /> There were scenes in this book so brutal that I had to put it down and quit reading it for the day. And I am not easily shocked. <br /> In my opinion this is a very good and important book, definitely worth the money you will spend on it. This is one of the most important American fictions books of the late twentieth century by one of America's most important novelists. It is  a book that could only be written in America. Brett Easton Ellis is an American Novelist.	2005-10-11

The aspect that is most compelling is the way Carole shows the importance of friendship.      Anthony Radziwill, (JFK Jr.'s cousin) and his close relationship with John Jr. carried him through the toughest of times in his battle with cancer.  John affectionately referred to Anthony as \\"TonyPro,\\" and just when everyone, including the reader thinks Anthony will die, John takes him to a sacred time and place by humming a song that Jackie O. sang to them as children.  Anthony, barely concious, hums the tune back with a faint smile.  We know he will live a little bit longer.    However, the friendship that is most touching is that of Carole Radziwill (Anthony's wife and author of this book) and Carolyn Bisette Kennedy.  What the public never saw about Carolyn was that she is the friend everyone longs to have.  She is fun, thoughtful, reliable, and hysterically funny.  She calls Carole \\"lamb\\" and rubs Anthony's feet when he is lying in the hospital with cancer.  Carolyn gives away her possesions because she thinks they will look good on her friends.  She says funny things like \\"Lamb you must get rid of those tapered jeans, or I'll have to ban you from the house! \\"  Carolyn makes everything fun, including taking a trip to get tulips and eating spaghetti-O's right out of the can.  Through Carole and Anthony's denial that he will die, Carolyn is the only one who notices exactly what Carole is going through.  She is a devoted friend and she steps in to help Carole when she is needs it most.    When Carolyn was alive, she was portrayed poorly in the media because she did not like the publicity that marrying the man she loved brought to her life.  This book shows the person that Carolyn really was, and it made me cry because she was lost too soon.      I admire Carole Radziwill for everything she endured.  She is a beautiful person and author.  I hope she has found comfort and is able to move on now that she has captured the partof her life she holds sacred so wonderfully.  Carole wrote this book because she was worried that some of the memories were starting to fade.  Now she can never forget the details and moments that were the best of her life.    If you value friendships, then this book will show how to value them even more.  \\"What Remains\\" will also teach you through tradgedy that life really does happen in the moments and details that happen quickly, but mean so much.	2005-10-11

Another title for this review could have been \\"Risky business\\".  It is the intriguing tale of a woman who has lived on the edge for most of her life, and who has experienced things you and I would never want to imagine.<br /><br />In a life story that the National Enquirer would have been proud to scoop, a headstrong and determined young woman named Yvonne Shilkin went against the tide, first carving a niche for herself as a singer, (a white, Australian Aretha Franklin), giving up that dream by refusing to compromise on her principles, marrying the man her mother warned her about, enduring a divorce from hell, witnessing the murder of her fianc&eacute;, and then finding love with a wonderful man, only to be kidnapped for eleven horrible days in Russia as a result of the couple's very lucrative but risky business ventures as barter/trade agents.<br /><br />Unknowingly and perhaps naively putting their eggs in the same basket with criminals and thugs, the couple's ordeal only came to a relatively happy ending thanks to a series of fortunate events, some dependable friends, a brilliant and well connected Russian lawyer and a sympathetic, ambitious and competent Russian Colonel.<br /><br />I say relatively happy, because the ordeal has had lasting effects on the author, leading to divorce, fear of victimization from the largely unpunished perpetrators, and financial ruin.<br /><br />On the other hand, the fat lady hasn't sung, and the story hasn't ended.  The author has since pulled herself together financially, found happiness with the soul mate she waited over forty years to find, and is now living with her extended family in the United States.<br /><br />This true story is simply told, and although the most brutal parts are not graphically described, what we are told is more than enough to understand the meaning of Primo Levi's words, \\"I am constantly amazed by man's inhumanity to man.\\"<br /><br />Rated 4.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 11, 20052005 <br />	2005-10-11

Given that the book is 398 pages total, according to my abacus that's 8.2% floggers, 4% Turk's Heads, and 35.4% other projects; and the first third of the book covers all the techniques you might possibly need to build everything (and then some).  I've no idea what more Mr. Edmundson was looking for, and suspect that Demonia, LeatherMan, Eros Boutique, Il Bolero, and NorthBound Leather wouldn't know either, but perhaps he just wants help remodelling his kitchen. :-) <br /> <br />Personally, I thought the book was fantastic.  As mentioned above, it's encyclopedic, and coming from a toy conoisseur like me, that's saying something.  About the only criticism I can think of is that there's SO much stuff in there that, despite a reasonably clear layout, it feels a bit overwhelming.  If you have any interest in bondage toys, though, and (like me) covet BDSM gearbeyond what your wallet can keep up with, you should definitely try this book.	2005-10-11

Jim Edgar, Bad Cat (Workman, 2004)<br /><br />By now, I don't think there's anyone who has an Internet connection who hasn't heard of mycathatesyou. But there are still some remote places on the planet where there are no Internet connections, much less broadband (for example, Missouri). For those poor, unfortunate souls, Jim Edgar, the supreme guru of mycathatesyou, has distilled two hundred forty-four of the site's most wanted, given them captions, and turned them into this small, hilarious book.<br /><br />Pictures of cats who look like they want to kill you are relatively commonplace, and have been ever since someone decided that trying to photograph a cat was a good idea. Edgar, however, has a knack of putting captions with the pictures that induce laughter. (As in, out-loud, make-people-on-the-street-look-at-you-funny laughter.) The captions are what turn this from a work of unbearable cuteness into the greatness it is. Love cats, hate cats, cower in fear from them because they bring on asthma attacks, you will love this. ****	2005-10-11

I must admit, I've not touched this book in quite some time... in fact, I decided instead to listen to Martin's own reading of it on the unabridged CD set.  Martin proves, once again, just-how-talented and versatile he is within the performing arts -- having moved from comedian to actor and now to a fiction writer, he's simply a pleasure to read (and to hear) as he so expertly portrays a young, depressed woman in her almost desperate search for the wrong kind of love.  As depressing a story as this may be overall, it's simply great to see the talent and words from source an almost unexpected source... definitely a recommendation, I'd encourage those with the time to pursue Martin's own unabridged reading on CD, as I can imagine it only further adds to a very good story.	2005-10-11

I've known several people who have done this program and when they follow it, they lose weight, they look good. But no one I know, including myself, has ever been able to stay on this program. And don't kid yourself, it's a program that involves intensive(though brief periods of)excersize. There is nothing wrong with excersize, I do it, I enjoy it and it's good for you. But realistically you have to eat right (good fats) to not have cravings and hunger, having cravings is a sure-fire way way to NOT follow a diet. I would not recommend this to anyone simply because it's not a program people stick with. This author is also a big promoter of \\"his\\" weight-loss and protein products, which are expensive and can be bought in other forms much cheaply.

It will tax all existing wealth producing goods at a confiscatory 23%; the Fair Tax taxes the assets of everyone at 23%! <br /> <br />The economists who did research for the Fair Tax know this, but Americans for Fair Taxation continues to lie: <br /> <br />Fair Tax economist George Zodrow:  <br />\\"Specifically, the introduction of a consumption tax tends to result in a one-time windfall loss to the owners of existing capital, especially relatively wealthy elderly generations, which effectively redistributes money to younger and future generations through the mechanism of a lower future tax rate.\\" <br /> <br />Fair Tax economist Laurence Kotlikoff: (Link) <br />\\"Were the well-established businessmen who advocate the Fair Tax to proclaim that their reform (1) levies a tax on the holdings of wealth, (2) provides a highly progressive tax rebate, and (3) implies an increase in Social Security benefits and, most likely, transfers to the poor, they would probably be viewed as members of a vast left-wing conspiracy. Yet, this is precisely what they are recommending. <br /> <br />I predict that, at some point, the redistributionists who favor the sales tax will admit their tax is a tax on wealth. When they do, the sales tax redistributionists will try to convince us this tax on wealth is necessary and good. We can have a clean consumption tax with the flat income tax and simple transition policies. The sales tax proponents are the same tax and spenders we have fought against all along. <br />	2005-10-11

Despite the fact that this worthy artists medium was first commissioned by none less than Pablo Picasso, it has remained at most despised by 'serious' artists, as a tool for students or the kindergarten or regarded as a means for sketching or preliminary working of ideas. <br />John Elliot demonstrates with unbridled enthusiasm that oil pastel is not only an exciting form of expression but perhaps the medium of the future standing along-side oil, soft pastel and the usurper, acrylic as a real option for artistic expression. <br />The book is a joy to own and J. Elliot leaves no doubt as to the power and flexibility of this medium. <br />Everything is covered clearly and the illustrations again demonstrate the full versitality of oil pastel, both wax and the new water-soluble media. Instructions are clear and concise drawing from years of experience. <br />This book is perhaps the 'Bible' of the oil pastel. <br />At last oil pastel gets the recognition it desesrves.	2005-10-11

This exhaustively researched book tells the story of each ship that was there from the 136 gun 'Nuestra Senora de Santisima Trinidad' to to the 30 (maybe 35) men on board the Armed Schooner 'Pickle.' (The 'Pickle' was smart enough to stay out of the way of the big boys and watch the battle. Afterward she went in to rescue sailors from sinking ships.)<br /><br />Each ship is described in detail, many with drawings made by the author for this publication. The history of each ship is given along with a description of what she did at Travalgar. Along with the history of each ship, there is a good bit of summary information about the three fleets. Carrying some 47,000 men these ships were the visible evidence of the most complex things yet devised by man.<br /><br />This is a beautiful book, and includes several pages of full color illustrations from paintings of the period, modern photographs of models of some of the ships, and current photographs of the preserved flagship 'Victory.'	2005-10-11

A fascinating insight into Jeffersonian politics and time when the North African states of Tripoli, Tunis, Morocco and Algiers were practicing the piracy and slavery trade.  Their piracy would include the capture, enslavement and ransom requirement of the ships crews.  A time when some European countries would pay tributes to the rulers of these states rather than engaging in a all out war. <br /> <br />This book reveals William Eaton as a flawed but honest and patriotic to a fault.  His covert mission to overthrow the ruler of Tripoli and the subsequent freeing of the American sailors captured after the incompetent Captain Bainbridge surrendered the USS Philadelphia while it was grounded on a reef. <br /> <br />You will appreciate the insight into people like Tobias Lear, friend of George Washington who trips up Eaton's goals and sets Jefferson up to pay for the release of the captured sailors.  You will read just how low people and politics will sink with Lear. <br /> <br />Learn the true story behind the Marine Corps Hymn words \\"to the shores or Tripoli\\". <br /> <br />Thomas Jefferson, a multi-faceted politician shows us a few more cuts on his personality and thought processes. <br /> <br />If you think you are confused with current events and geopolitical events now?  This insight into the Barbary Coast will show you that are forefathers have been at this practice a long time. <br /> <br />You will feel William Eaton's frustration, Tobias Lear's cowardice and need for money and Jefferson's indifference and triumphs.  <br />A very good read. <br />	2005-10-11

The Angevins, beginning with Henry II, had an almost equally great impact and their control continued more or less strongly for several centuries. In the earlier period, a century before the Conquest, the counts of Anjou were every bit the equals of the dukes of Normandy, eventually establishing an empire that stretched from  Scotland to the Pyrenees, and which encompassed both England and Aquitaine in addition to Anjou itself. The story really begins with Fulk Nerra, who built the Angevin state, both physically and politically, and laid the essential groundwork for Henry's later conquests. Of course, Fulk's efforts were based on those of his own predecessors, back into the early 9th century, and Bachrach spends a fair amount of time discussing this ancestral power and its roots in the old Roman civitates. Bachrach is perhaps the leading present authority on the Angevins and his theories are worth paying attention to. There's also an excellent, lengthy bibliography.	2005-10-11

Although the book reviewers have been less than kind to her, I think of that as more an endorsement than anything.

Should have been titled: \\"The God Particle - Pg. 366-376\\"  The book speaks very little about the Higgs boson for which it is named after.  Instead Lederman focusses on the idea of the unsplittable 'a-tom'.  Lederman goes through 'a-tom' history from the early Greek philosophers to the year 1993.   <br /> <br />Here are some quick thoughts on the book itself:   <br />(1) As to be expected, the book is a tad bit outdated.   Since 1993 the top quark has been found and the SSC has been cancelled (which is unfortunate since he had so much hope for it throughout the book, oops!).   <br />(2) The book has its humor but I would not call it side-splitting.  I found it somewhat irritating that he often jumped to a side-story just to tell a joke.   <br />(3) An earlier reviewer said it contained \\"dense math\\" though the only few equations that are in the book are to show what people put on t-shirts or to show that the symbol 'M' is different from 'm' which he explains anyway.  Any particle decay 'equations' are to be taken as givens for the reader. <br />(4) The history is decent. <br /> <br />The book was worth reading, though I am not sure who it was written for.  On one hand, people looking for information on the Higgs would not wish to read the majority of this book's content.  On the other hand, people looking for history on the idea of an 'a-tom' would not pick a book called \\"The God Particle\\".	2005-10-11

Kurt Vonnegut may be old (yes, it looks like he's wearing some sort of wig, and he has emphysema from all those Pall Malls), but he hasn't lost it. Besides, history shows us that good health is no prerequisite for writers (just look at F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"Last Tycoon,\\" written when he could barely even walk up a flight of stairs)--nor is it a prerequisite for American presidents (compare FDR's health to GWB's). Still, if you want a younger, healthier dose of misanthropic comedy, try Russell David Harper's absurd, understated novel \\"Bald\\" (and look for the Vonnegut-inspired hairpiece graphic on page 181).	2005-10-11

I read this book because, as a future math/science teacher, I was asked to write an essay on whether or not creationism & intelligent design should be taught in biology classes.  My intitial reaction was yes, they should be taught, so that students are aware of the alternative arguments and the counter-arguments. <br /> <br />After reading this book, I am a cautious supporter of ID.  I do not know, nor does Behe, who the designer(s) might be.  But I must admit that I am appalled by the simplistic attacks on this book by so many other contributors to this site.  Guys, grow up and open your minds.  Evolution is a historical fact, as Behe agrees.  This was known before Darwin.  Darwin is famous because he came up with a mechanism - natural selection working on random variation - to explain evolution.  Behe has demonstrated the inadaquacy of this mechanism to explain systems that appear to be irriducibly complex.  If Darwinism is to be more than an ideology, then Behe's arguments should be dealt with rationally.  So leave the emotional diatribes in the sandbox, and try to think outside of it.	2005-10-11

She nailed a legacy from a female relative, she nailed my house purchase, she nailed the week in which to settle for a mortgage (I got a historically low rate, which lasted for exactly one week, and has never been seen again), she nailed a huge (HUGE) pay rise and she just nailed a payout from an insurance company.

Well those pompous would-be-critics need to realize that Laura Resnick, despite being the author of a dozen romantic novels and other short stories, is just making a first attempt at writing epic fantasy. She did a very good job for a first time author and has plenty of time to grow better at her craft.       As for the story, in it Tansen, an exiled native of the island realm of Sileria, returns after having fled nine years before to escape a contract put on his life by a powerful elemental wizard called a waterlord. He returns home, now a master swordsman and experienced mercenary, and causes a near riot when he resists being arrested by the Outlooker soldiers of the occupying Valdani empire. He is taken and coerced by the local garrison commander into assasinating Josarian, a local outlaw and Robin Hood type.       He agrees to this with no intention of carrying out the murder but instead befriends Josarian and joins him in inciting rebellion against the Valdani overlords. Together, along with a fire mage named Mirabar, they unite the peasant class of Sileria with the nobility, waterlords, and fire mages in making an all out guerilla war against their opressers.     Laura Resnick provides a very rich culture and exotic Mediterranean-like island for the setting. The action is first rate and engrossing with a healthy but not distracting amount of romance. First rate debut by any author just starting in the genre.	2005-10-11

Eric Jerome Dickey, ever since Sister Sister, has raised and kept the bar elevated for popular fiction.  His writing is superior, his subtle humor laugh-out-loud inspiring, and his sex scenes flat out raw.  He's definitely royalty in the game.<br /><br />In regard to this particular book, it starts off with a spicy hook that grabs you.  The story, however, doesn't go quite where you thought it would take you, however.  The twist is that it is more of a story more about the narrator's wife than it is about the affair he has with her sister, which is cool, just not quite what's anticipated based on the setup.  Just keep the title in mind and you'll breeze through the story without anticipating the wrong things.<br /><br />Also, it might be kind of hard to swallow, to even imagine, this journey of a husband's easy betrayal with his wife's very SISTER as presented in this tale, but keep reading and stay curious because the narrator is so honest that this book can also be considered part cautionary tale. In an unexpected way, it is rewarding to get inside such an everyman's thoughts.  I suppose that's why Dickey left the protagonist unnamed, perhaps?<br /><br />Dickey's style is so clever and so fun that even in this story's darkest moments you'll love the way you get to gasp out loud and flip through pages.<br /><br />Genevieve is yet another example of why Eric Jerome Dickey (and his books) reign literary supreme.  Dickey does not disappoint, nor does he ever.  I definitely recommend.	2005-10-11

This is exactly the science I have been interested in learning -- a mix of cold reading, plus the study of social dynamics, body language, kinesthology, Neuro Linguistic Programming, eye movements (did you know that the eye goes to one of seven positions when a person is thinking, and each position means something different?), and pretty much everything else you could study that would allow you to read people's minds and control their behavior -- for the power of good, I swear! For good!<br /><br />This non-fiction account of a group of PUAs (as guys who devote themselves to \\"the study of seduction\\" call themselves) was fascinating to me on so many levels: the bizarre friendships and competitions between these weird, desperate guys; the reverse psychology (if I pretend to dislike you, you will want me) that many women find irresistible, the fact that Courtney Love shows up in the middle of this PUA pad called Project Hollywood, moves in, and starts hammering at stuff with her Prada shoe at 2 in the morning. Am I doing this thing justice? It really is one of the funnest, wackiest things I've read in a long while -- I bought it to take on the honeymoon with me, and finished it twenty four hours later.<br /><br />But possibly the best thing about this book is the conversation I had with the girl at the register when I bought it. She looked at it and said, \\"You would not believe how many guys are buying this book.\\" And then she shuddered. \\"Like, middle aged men. So scary.\\"<br /><br />I don't quite know yet whether I should be telling all the single male friends I have to buy it, or warning women.	2005-10-11

They are best friends `til the end, living, loving and sometimes losing in the land where no one walks.  Their love lives seem to be moving forward in a positive fashion and yet, both of them get little hints that not all that glitters is gold.  Eric paints a true-to-life picture of women trying to understand the men in their lives.  From love-to-hate characters like Deja's hard-on-the-outside-but-kinda-soft on-the-inside brother, Theron, who breezes in and out of her life like the wind; Isrie's ex-boyfriend Ryan a record producer, who is prettier than most women are and unfortunately knows it; and her new man Michael who seems too good to be true and probably is; to Ivan the model, who just wants a regular girl like Deja (or so it seems); as well as parents who stay on Isrie's case about finding a man and settling down.  Twisted makes you immediately feel like you know these people.   <br /> <br />The sex was raw and brazen with a touch of humor, as it should be.  The language was, at times, fresh, foul, and funny all at once, and the characters were appealing, irritating, and real, as they should be.  All these ingredients are vintage Eric Pete, but what sets Twisted apart is how Eric captured the sheer essence of real black women as they interact in their daily lives.  He has done much to counter the myth of the strong black woman and showed how sensitive, vulnerable, feminine and pure we really are.  Eric touched on the little things that women notice, like the way a man's goatee curls when he smiles.  Or how we can size up a woman and know when a man has been intimate with her.  He also sensitively deals with issues like body image, date rape, and domestic abuse, things women deal with on the regular.    <br /> <br />It feels odd saying these things about a man writing from a woman's perspective, but truth be told, Eric simply gets it.   Moreover, he captured our passion, our humor, and lust for life and a few other things as well!  After getting to know these engaging characters, the story almost didn't matter because I can always depend on Eric to give me a good story with lots of twists and turns and Twisted didn't disappoint me, believe that!  Nevertheless, what truly blew me away was the fact that I was left with the feeling that there is at least one man out there who knows the heart of black women, a comforting thought indeed.  Well done, Eric! <br />	2005-10-11

Brian kinda lost me on the \\"I LIKE MYSELF\\" affirmations. To me it was just a little too touchy-feely. Thankfully I just recently listened through the rest of the tapes and am very pleased with the overall content. I am definitely planning to listen to it again. And next time I will take notes during the program. <br /> <br />The set covers everything from child/adolescent development issues, parenting, work, frienship, relationships in general, work, life, happiness, spirituality, etc. It is amazing how many different areas are covered with these (6 or 8?) tapes. <br /> <br />What I found most helpful with the tape series is there is a section on goal-setting. Specifically how to figure out what you want. And with me I always have a harder time figuring out *what* goals I want, not with achieving them. Brian shows a framework and method of figuring out what your goals should be, then describes tools to pursue them. I have gone through many many courses, seminars, tapes, books, and his method is the most cohesive I've run across. <br /> <br />All in all this is a very worthwhile tape series. There is something there for everyone. And it's arranged in a progressive manner, which helps lay out the thinking, planning, etc. Although for me, some parts were a little too touch-feely. Still highly recommended.	2005-10-11

I must confess that after reading the debut novel in this series, \\"If Angels Burn,\\" I was more intrigued by the plot summary for the next book (\\"Dark Need\\") than for this one.  I knew I would snap up a copy of \\"Private Demon\\", but I admit I didn't think I would enjoy this installment nearly as much as I did.  Lynn Viehl has single-handedly created the most exciting new paranormal series I've read in the last couple years with the Darkyn novels.  <br /> <br />\\"Private Demon\\", I think, is a much more character-based installment than \\"If Angels Burn\\" -- opening the door wide on people we'd only previously been given a glimpse of, as well as deepening the already rich detail on players central to the story in the first book.  The Darkyn universe is a fascinating place with multiple layers of conflict and intrigue and emotion and struggle.  The various relationships are vividly drawn and incredibly compelling.  Damaged as they are, Thierry Durand and Jema Shaw manage to find each other in this story, and their connection as it evolves under Viehl's skillful guidance is both moving and romantic -- and intensely erotic to boot. <br /> <br />Interestingly, PD also managed to resolve many of the issues I'd had with the debut novel, by bringing back Michael and Alexandra from IAB and carrying them forward, while also clarifying some of the more convoluted twists surrounding the Durand family's connection with the evil Darkyn-hunting Brethren.   <br /> <br />Anyway...the Darkyn series is shaping up into a fantastic storyline. Better and more sophisticated and timely than a lot of other current offerings in the genre. The \\"Dark Need\\" excerpt at the end only makes the waiting worse.  I absolutely cannot wait to read more. Here's hoping that Lynn Viehl has many more novels planned for this excellent series.	2005-10-11

At the time there was little or no understanding of earthquakes other than their being acts of God. It wasn't until 1968 that the concept of plate tectonics began to be developed that explained not only this earthquake but the 'ring of fire' that circles the Pacific Ocean.   <br /> <br />Mr. Winchester is an Oxford trained geologist who approaches this writing with the knowledge of an expert and the eye of a novelist. This book is a story of how the San Francisco earthquake was the first to be a major media event. He starts with the story of San Francisco and the earthquake. He recreates the story through the experiences of selected witnesses -- scientists, laborers, businesmen and more famous people such as Enrique Caruso and Ansel Adams.   <br /> <br />Beyond the story of this particular earthquake, this really began the study of earthquakes and eventually to the development of theories explaining how they happened.	2005-10-11

This book looks at why democratic societies must respond to things like cloning, genetic engineering and nanotechnology, instead of pretending that they don't exist. <br /> <br />What the author calls \\"bio-Luddites\\" are opposed to such new technologies, because they feel that mankind should be happy with its 70 (or so) years of life, characterized by increasing bodily disfunction in its later stages. Another reason for opposition is the vague, but always there, possibility of a disaster unleashing some new plague on the world. Some people say that taboos and gut feelings are the path to wisdom. If a new technology feels spooky, ban it immediately. The Catholic Church opposes such things because they are supposedly offensive to God. <br /> <br />On the other hand, if a person is found to be a carrier for, or genetically susceptible to, Disease X, don't they have the right to fix their DNA (assuming a safe and reliable method can be found to do so)? Those who call themselves transhumanists (based on humanism) believe that people should have the right to modify their bodies, whether the quest is for greater intelligence, longevity or a happier outlook on life. They are the first to assert that there must be adequate discussion beforehand, and adequate safeguards after the introduction of a new technology. Such things must also be available to all people, through some sort of universal health insurance, not just to the rich. Transhumanists have no desire to take over the world, but one of the subjects for social consideration has to be how to extinguish potential schisms between humans and posthumans. To those who think that some new regulatory agency is needed, the author does not agree. Agencies like the FDA and EPA will be able to do the job, if they ever get the funding and authority needed. Don't forget that 25 years ago, in vitro fertilization wasconsidered an abomination; now it is practically mainstream. <br /> <br />This is a pretty specialized book, but it shouldn't be. Like it or not, the new technologies described in this book are coming in the near future. It is better to start discussing, now, how to deal with them, instead of just saying No. The reader may not agree with everything in this book, but it is an excellent place to begin that discussion. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

All darkness is bypassed by the light of the love in his life.  The torment alluded to in \\"Pleasurable Frustration\\" is delightfully desirous...    You delve into me deeply  Discovering facets I didn't fathom  Making me yearn for innocent folly  And wish for blasphemous rhythm  ~pg. 48    It is the edge drawn in delicate hues that leads the reader to believe that the man gives in to the bite of passion despite the all-consuming love for his mate, and that nibble leads way to her melting into \\"them\\".    The lines:     She is the enigma  I strain to explain  yet in her eyes  I fathom infinity  ~pg. 22    drawing \\"I Fathom Infinity\\" to a close, prove case in point.  The unexplainable is given definition within the knowing that she is what makes him what he needs to be forever.  As in \\"Perfectly Said\\":    She is light and tender grace  and the world is joy around me..  ~pg. 11    there is no better way to explain all that leaves him at a loss for words in her presence.  Their forays into a sensual place are couched in natural metaphors that bring an appreciation for God's creations even as your breath catches and you chew your nail to the quick.    To balance his equator in rhyme and time, Brian forays into deep questions with a grand attempt to answer them as he ponders \\"Answers to Everlasting Strands\\".  Yet his sadly sweet dedication to Polly Klaas in \\"Polly's High Firefly Season\\" leaves us feeling her loss with each winking glimpse of a firefly dance.  These brief and subtle glimpses into another shade of Brian's heartening character, in my humble opinion, are summed up in the last four lines of this book..    Meaning is found in many different places  Each of us different in how we choose to live  It could be a church, garden, or newborn faces  The real meaning, is how we love and give  ~pg.86    A healthy respect for the reader's sensibilities glosses over any intrusion of the world's perception of the art of poetry.  An exquisitely written book, offered in such a beguiling form is well worth the read and the time spent to read his words over and over again.  A gem to be cherished and not left to gather dust on a far reaching shelf but to be thumbed, tic'd, dog-eared and worn to a condition of scotch- taped glory.  This poet, as a person and a writer, is proof positive that sometimes God breaks the mold when he creates a \\"Master\\" without bowing to the stereotype of a man.    It has been my pleasure to make the acquaintance of Brian Douthit and to be included in his \\"Eyes of the Poet\\" project.  Sharing the vision of contributing to the survival of poetry, my only hope is that we, as part of the Poetry in Motion movement, are successful in resurrecting poetry as a renewed art form.    ~Diane Anjoue,   Author of Collection de Jolie-Laide, wanting to be lost within...

Some of the stories are obviously complete fiction, made up to pad this collection out to book-size. (Sometimes one of the problems with sequels is lack of material.)  As the author puts it in his introduction, \\"Whether you choose to believe any of these tales is essentially immaterial.\\"<br /><br />Some of the stories are framed as eye-witness accounts, e.g. \\"The Lighthouse\\" which was supposedly given to the author by \\"a sailor of long experience.\\"  These tales tend to be cheerfully supernatural:  \\"...we grabbed a couple of beers from the reefer and went ashore in the rubber dingy...[to investigate the haunted lighthouse],\\" and the author certainly seems to have his nautical terminology down pat. (Were sailing ships really called 'wind wagons'?)<br /><br />Instead of a fog-bound hellpit of drowned sailors, the book reminds me of a nautically-themed carnival sideshow, where like the amazing mermaid with the stitched-on fish tail, the supernatural is stitched onto a bit of local history:<br /><br />* Read about the general store that is haunted by the sound of squeaky bedsprings!<br /><br />* Read about the St. Ignace Island Lighthouse of Doom!<br /><br />* Read about the clock that was thrown into a swamp and reappeared in its familiar spot on the wall two days later!<br /><br />* Read about the Crawling Ghost of Calvary Cemetery!<br /><br />If you like your ghost stories funky, eccentric, and cheerful--rather like a Benny Hill episode with ghosts, \\"Haunted Lakes II\\" is a fun book to read.	2005-10-11

This one has action, and plenty of it.  This was the first book in the series that I read, and it sparked my interest enough to buy all the other books.  The character development of the terrorists in this one is top notch.  In very few pages, Rapp is able to paint the picture of what is driving these guys.  This book, like most of his others, starts out fast with a raid on a terrorist compound.  The action doesn't stop from there.  The buildup of intensity is incredible as a nuke is set to go off in the States, there are many possibilities and tracks to follow, and there is only one man for the job.  This book made Rapp the exciting character I needed, and it led me to read all the books with his character.  Can't miss for fans of stories on terrorism and heroism.  If you like these types of books, go get it...you will not regret it.	2005-10-11

I don't think there are any stories that are intriguing after not only the first, but the second and third, read. This is one of the few. The level of detail is descriptive without being wordy or drawn out. The characters are well developed and allow the reader to connect on a personal level. Everyone can find a little of themselves in at least one character. I would recommend this book to just about anyone. If you offend easily, this may not be for you because it contains scenes that are a little explicit and language that is a little harsh. If you can get past that, the storyline is well worth it.	2005-10-11

Photoshop skills were taught primarily in the context professional training and education. With the maturing of digital photography, and its wide acceptance, the need for powerful image manipulation software is obvious, and users have gravitated to the standard, Adobe Photoshop. Photoshop is a complex and powerful program, and it has the reputation of being difficult to learn.  So it is a welcome development to find a book such as Deke McClelland's Adobe Photoshop CS2: One-on-One on the shelves.  <br /> <br />One glance at this book and you'll see that this book is a bargain. It is visually stunning. As you browse through the sample images and the carefully crafted instructions for creating such images yourself, you'll be inspired to run out and get Photoshop CS2 if you don't have it, or fire it up with your latest digital camera images if you do.  <br /> <br />McClelland walks the reader through the most important features of Photoshop and provides step by step instructions for their use. For example, there's a very compelling treatment of unsharp mask, and its successor function in this version of Photoshop, SmartSharpen filter. As McClelland notes, almost every image requires some sharpening, and in eight easy to understand steps, you are guided through this function in such a way that you will be able to use it again and again.  <br /> <br />The book comes with a very well-produced DVD with over two hours of video lessons. These complement the book nicely. If you own a digital camera, you will want to own this book.	2005-10-11

The book also provides possible sibiling names and alternative spellings for names that are featured in it.  Be advised that some of the names that appear in the categorized lists do not appear in the main part of the book. <br /> <br />Despite its numerous categories and lists, the book fails to provide a wide range of names that appeal to various tastes and styles.

Like the way he presented his mother, Amos Oz is a born story teller and a great painter with words.  There is not a place, a person or an activity but that he presents it in such detail that you can actually SEE them.  But I must say that often I found the detail excessive.  He seems to have total recall, which is often rewarding but can at other times be a bit of a bore. He tells you the number of steps leading up into a house; he describes the smallest objects in a room without asking himself whether they are truly necessary to establish the room's atmosphere; he is inordinately fond of lists.  Here, for instance, is a sentence describing his mother working silently and efficiently in the house:  &#34;She cooked, baked, did the washing, put the shopping away, ironed, cleaned, tidied, washed the dishes, sliced vegetables, kneaded dough.&#34; His aunts, who tell him about the family's life in Poland, also seem to have had total recall: that life is richly reconstructed, but again for my taste the pudding is often over-egged. Then he describes in minute detail and several times exactly which streets he or his mother would take from one location in Jerusalem to another.  That might possibly be evocative for Jerusalemites who know the city; but if they know the city, do they need such a guide?  These tiresome excesses are most in evidence when he describes his earliest years, until he is about eight years old; but those chapters take up  about 2/3rds of this massive book (though his tale is never entirely chronological).  Then, when he is eight, the War of Independence happens (excellent description of Jerusalem under siege), to be followed by the establishment of the State of Israel, and now the narrative becomes rather more concentrated and  with fewer of the mannerisms of the earlier part.  There is a magnificent description how, at the age of 15,  this pale, immensely precocious cerebral but romantic youth escapes from the stifling intellectual world  represented by his father and his father's friends, to live among the bronzed young gods on a kibbutz.  He will stay on that kibbutz for the next 31 years, but his story ends with his adolescent admiration of the goddess who will become his wife five or six years later.  And that is where, chronologically, his story ends (though throughout the book there are brief references to events in his later life).<br /><br />This is a totally inadequate account of the book, and does not even  touch on the thread that runs throughout: his relationship with his parents and their relationship with each other.  Despite the irritations I sometimes felt, I was never tempted to put the book aside: it is far too interesting and well-written for that.sely precocious cerebral but romantic youth escapes from the stifling intellectual world  represented by his father and his father's friends, to live among the bronzed young gods on a kibbutz.

To me, it would have been better off ending up as a two page People magazine article. <br /> <br />I would have liked to have known more about Paul Lynde and what made him tick beyond his only being a mean drunk.  There just isn't any substance to this book.  It never goes into much detail on his friends or short term lovers, only touches on his career moves, and basically leaves you wondering what this man was really all about.  The quotes from Cloris Leachman, Charlotte Rae and the others are usually one liners and it seems as if they were obtained through a 30 second phone call.  There are a couple of teasers like the spat with Jonathan Winters, yet it never discloses why the spat progressed or even what it was about.  You're just left with this empty feeling of \\"Why am I reading this?\\"  <br /> <br />Paul Lynde was never an A-List star, and this book sure isn't an A-List biography.  I finished it, but it wasn't easy.  I maybe chuckled twice during my reads, and then you remember that Paul Lynde didn't even write his own answers on Hollywood Squares.

The average laymen doesn't understand canon law and I feel the author cited them not even in their full contexts. The good Lord doesn't expect for us to be canon lawyers in order to know our faith, but one would reply \\"that's why we have the church government and the Pope to interpret the law.\\" True but that's in very complex circumstances. The good Lord wanted the Catholic Faith to be understandable to all, even the dullest intelligence. <br /> <br />Second this book makes it seem as the Pope can NEVER error, as if by his title he is protected from error at every moment. This is false! The pope is given assistance by the Holy Ghost when he calls upon Him and is given extra graces for his position (as pope). Due to his human nature, however, the pope can reject this guidance or these extra graces.  It would therefore be possible for him to error in many things! <br /> <br />I was raised a Catholic and noticed many errors and changes in the church so I felt the best way to find the truths were to talk to both priests from the local diocese as well as some \\"traditonal priests\\". As one might have guessed, each defended their positions, but the traditional priests made much more sense of the problems in the church and seemed much holier. I decided to research for myself by diving into past church councils and papal writtings to find the truth.  Everything led to \\"Traditional Catholicism\\", they consistantly matched with what the church had always done, the \\"diocesan churches\\" made many, many changes and departed from the faith. <br /> <br />If you're serious about learning the truths please look at both sides of the coin, read some of these books I read available on Amazon that show the other side: Priest where is thy Mass, Mass where is thy Priest by Angelus Press. Schism or Not! A much easier book to understand which also looks at church law.  This book is also by the Angelus press. Lastly, Archbishop Lefebvre and the Vatican. This book shows all the dialogue leading up to the consecrations of the 4 bishops. It shows how Rome was never going to allow the Archbishop consecrate a bishop in the hopes that he would pass away before he could! <br /> <br />In the words of Pope St. Pius X, \\"True friends of the people are neither innovators or revolutionaries, but men of TRADITION.\\"	2005-10-11

Books	5	14	15	N	N	Cleopatra Comes To Life Again, After 2000 Years	This book, I would say, is the best book I have read, (and that's a lot) on the Ptolemaic Period and Egypt's last and fateful Macedonian Queen, who died for her ambition, and desire to restore her country as major power. She was brave enough to challenge the enslaving and powerful force of Rome, and dreamed of an independant Egyptian Empire. But her attempt to achieve her goal cost her her life, and her country. <br />After her death, the Romans destroyed most representations of her. They overlooked, however, the many exquisite Egyptian-style statues of the queen, however, and instead destroyed what would have been the many classical depictions of her, which are lost to the Romans wrath. But fortunately, the Egyptian art survived the centuries, and with these gorgeous and mysterious representations of the living goddess herself, Susan Walker, with the help of the British Museum, has pieced together an accurate and enthralling portrait of her eventful life. <br />The sections, on subjects such as Alexandria, The Ptolemies, and Cleopatra and Rome, this book contains dozens of well-written and powerful essays on the monarch's life and relationship, and also Egypt at the time. Lavishly illustrated with hundreds of full color images of Egyptian style artwork depicting the queen, and also many statues of the people that influenced her life such as her lovers Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, and her nemesis, the enigma Octavian, later to be Augustus, the first emperor of Rome.  <br />I recommend very strongly this book to anyone at all interested in Egyptian, Greek, or Roman history, and art. An unearthly account of the last years of Egyptian power.	2005-10-11

Taking a leaf out of the Billy James school of how not to write a biography (have you read the Michael Bruce book or Zoot Horn Rolo's?-i rest my case)I was looking forward to a good read about possibly my favourite genre of music-southern rock. Firstly it's not comprehensive. No point blank,mama's pride or raging slab for starters and i maintain that Black Oak are southern (they released the single 'hey y'all' for goodness sake)but what really irritates me is the way the author WILL NOT slag any band off! He sucks up to them all. No southern band every made a bad album in his opinion. There is good in all of them (no one can convince me that the latter Marshall Tucker without Toy Cadwell are any good or that 38 special issued some radio friendly dross) believe me i brought every southern rock album i could get my hands on (still do) and some went straight to the second hand shop they were so awful. This isn't conscrutive journalism, all this book is is a poorly written, badly edited book with some incredible trivia which i don't care about and frankly a waste of time. Please someone write a decent overview of this great music. Oh some other points the Allman brothers did NOT play the isle of Wight festival in 1970. The first time they played U.K was the 'wipe the windows' line up. Paul Kossoff was the guitarist in Free and Paul Rogers is the singer and thirdly as great as the Allmans 'filmore album' i'm sick of the John Coltrane comparisons in their jamming. even the most ardent Brothers fan must admit that there is absolutely no similarities!	2005-10-11

This is just what Fireside books are meant to be - collections of memories, anecdotes, puzzles, lists and other trivia (and not so trivial) bits about chess.  This is of interest to those who have a deep abiding passion for chess, as well as for those who only dabble in it occasionally.  Both editors have written other books on chess; both Irving Chernev and Fred Reinfeld have written some of the better books on learning chess separately, and together they also collaborated on a book showing strategy and skills development toward winning at chess.<br /><br />This book is divided into three main sections.  The first section contains stories and articles, collected from various publications such as the New Yorker and other newspapers and magazines. Included are also comics from the New Yorker, the Saturday Review of Literature, the New York Herald and other sources.  Here are fake histories of the game, tongue-in-cheek stories, poignant memories and more.  From the 'Capsule History of the Game' by Chielamangus, we get this snippet:<br /><br />'The next great figure was Wilhelm Steinitz; a very deep player - also wide, though short.  He held the world's championship for twenty-six years, and was therefore considered by his rivals to be very obstinate and pig-headed.  Dr. Lasker then held the championship for another twenty-six years.  Critics explained that this was because he made weak moves.  This was psychology.  Lasker thus became known as the apostle of common sense.'<br /><br />The second section is entitled 'The Magic of Chess'.  The entry 'Odd But True' includes a feast of trivia items. How can a game be won (or lost) in two moves?  Was there really a master-level game that concluded in four moves?  What was the longest master-level game, in number of moves?  Many people through history have played through correspondence; given the amount of time permitted between moves, one would not expect too many mistakes, but the shortest of these types of games concluded in a mere six moves.  There was also a book published once in Germany with the title, 'Advice to Spectators at Chess Tournaments'.  All the pages were blank save one, which had but two words on it - 'Halt Maul!'<br /><br />The third section is a collection of classic games and strategies, which includes a lot games more interesting for the circumstances surrounding them as much as for the play that takes place.  These include miniatures (short games), blindfolded games, and even 'the perfect game'.  This has a strange quality about it in chess - according to Chernev and Reinfeld, the perfect game is not one in which all the moves are 'perfect':  'A game in which neither side has made a mistake does not add up to perfection; in such games we find only a sterile dullness which lacks every memorable feature.'<br /><br />Chernev and Reinfeld had the reputation for being able to speak for hours on end about chess without notes or books, much in the way many people will talk about sports, movies, politics or other areas.  They write with wit and skill (much like the way they play the game), and have the hope that through their writing their love of the game is contagious.  Judging from this book, one of my earliest books on chess, they are indeed.h correspondence; given the amount of time permitted between moves, one would not expect too many mistakes, but the shortest of these types of games concluded in a mere six moves.

Tables were piled high with books, many signed by their authors, men and women who had donated them to a good cause.  Many were in Asian languages I couldn't even read, but one or two of these I bought for Asian friends.  This book, GUNGA DIN HIGHWAY, proved a delightful surprise.  In a way, the book it reminds me most of is an oldie, the BIG ROCK CANDY MOUNTAIN from the 1950s, by Wallace Stegner, with its multi-generational narrative and its expansive, troubling vision of the USA.  In other ways it has some of the zany hippie humor you find in something like Tom Robbins' JITTERBUG PERFUME or EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES.  Either way, it's a winner.  And especially if you have an interest in cultural issues, for Frank Chin, the author, is a topnotch commentator with a waspish wit who absolutely hates the Charlie Chan movies.<br /><br />Our hero is the Number Four Son, that is, he once upon a time played the eager son of the great Chinese detective Charlie Chan, at a time when (the fictional) white actor, Anlauf Loraine, played Chan, the fourth white actor to do so.  Oddly, our hero Longman Senior has an intense relationship with his peers, the other Asian American actors who didn't get to play the father, but were always relegated to playing the son, including the real-life stars Victor Sen Yung, Benson Fong and Keye Luke, all of whom are dissed in context of the character.  Longman and his wife, Hyacinth, name their first born American son, Ulysses, after the famous banned modernist novel by James Joyce, and thus it's no wonder that Ulysses grows up to be, well, as one of his girlfriends puts it, \\"oversexed.\\"<br /><br />Through the 1950s and 1960s, the novel shows us a panoramic view of the sexual and cultural awakenings of several families whose lives intertwine in New York, Oakland, Seattle, Honolulu, Portland and Frisco.  Pandora Toy is an alluring, freshly conceived and brilliant young writer, who hooks up with Ulysses, which distances him somewhat from his kinship with his \\"blood brother,\\" the actor Ben Mo.  Chin's pictures of bohemian living, young people too poor to buy a house, and almost too poor to sign a lease, yet thriving in big city energy, might have come out of the musical RENT.  It's a long book, but no longer than, say, THE GRAPES OF WRATH or THE MAN WITHOUT QUALITIES, two other 20th century novels that came to mind while I flipped through the pages of GUNGA DIN HIGHWAY.  You should be able to read it over and over again, for such is its quality, that no sooner are you done with the final chapter, then you'll be wanting to start it from the beginning, like some kind of Mobius strip of Asian American experience.eattle, Honolulu, Portland and Frisco.

It does a good job of providing a general overview of a wide number of techniques with an emphasis on  practical considerations, such as the appropriateness and accuracy of the various techniques for a given type of problem, and the potential pitfalls that must be avoided. It does a great job of explaining the jargon and technical nomenclature, which would otherwise stump new-comers to the field, including short descriptions of the various levels of theory (Semi-empirical Methods, HF, DFT Methods, Perturbation theory, CI, CC, etc...), Basis Sets (STO-3G, 6-31G, CBS, LANL2DZ, etc...), calculation types (geometry optimization, frequency calculations, population analysis), and so on.  In addition it has a very useful appendix containing short reviews of about 30 different software packages used in the field.<br /><br />While the book is a useful practical guide, the potential buyer should recognize that it is not intended to be a textbook on Quantum Chemistry.  It provides a general overview of the various theories, indicating some of the major assumptions, but does not delve into any details of how the theories actually work or are implemented.  It contains very little math and doesn't even attempt to explain how to solve the few equations it does have (the obvious assumption being that the computer will solve them).  All of this is fine for the stated goal of the book, but the reader should realize that if he really wants to learn Quantum Chemistry, rather than just run a software program that uses it, he should at least find another book to read in conjunction with this one.<br /><br />On the practical side, this book does a good job of pointing out the weaknesses and strengths of the many computational chemistry techniques.  It also provides instructions for setting up calculations and, more importantly, recommendations for what to do when the calculations fail.  On the downside, because the book  covers such a wide range of topics and does not focus on a single software package or type of calculation, the advice or recommendations are sometimes too general to be of much use.  Nevertheless, armed with this book, one of the many available computational chemistry software packages, and its corresponding user's manual any competent chemist or chemical engineer should quickly be able to start running useful calculations.mmendations for what to do when the calculations fail.

It is a tragedy; no matter if the bull succeeds in killing the matador, and all the picadors and bandierros for that matter, he will still be executed after the fight. This is pure art, and nothing more. I can't explain why to you, but Hemingway says that it is very Spanish, and to understand it you must understand the Spaniards.  <br /> <br />This is just a general overview of bullfighting. The book is very descriptive and very much more worth your time. You will find that there is something of the bullfight and the muleta in all of us. <br />  <br />The three steps of the bullfight are clear and showcase the bull. (It is worth mentioning that these are not just any bulls: they are finely bred fighting bulls that are too agressive to be good for anything else.)  <br /> <br />One: the bull shows his strength and bravery in the killing of the horses in the first stage with the picador. The picador pierced the muscle on his shoulder, therefore showing the bravery of the bull if he continues through the pain to gore the horse. After this stage, the dead horses are covered and the bandierros enter the ring.  <br /> <br />Two: The bandierros use small spears with hooks on them so they stay in the bull's hide. They are 'set' in pairs in the large hump of agrivated muscle over the withers. These are used to raise the neck of the bull and therefore weakening it so the matador can do his work. In this stage the bull is confused: he cannot (if the man knows his work and is not unlucky) catch the man as he did in the last stage. His courage is useless.  <br /> <br />Three: The matador enters the arena (or barrera, I believe...it's been a while) to finish the bull. At this stage, the bull is tired and his head is beginning to droop. His shoulders are covered in blood but he stands there arrogant. The matador cannot rise over the horns of the bull to kill in his origional condition; therefore, he must tire him over the course of the three stages. The matador does his part with the muleta (cape) and then kills the bull by stabbing him with a sword to his heart. It is here, Hemingway will tell you, that the bull is either said to be killed or assasinated. If the matador is competent, his body will come over the top of the horn. If the bull lifts his head, the matador is gored. Thus, in a proper kill, the bull in the end had a chance to kill again. If the matador pulls back at the last second and just stabs the animal without the threat, he is said to \\"assasinate.\\" <br /> <br />This is excellent. Your friends might look at you a little funny for reading about \\"killing bulls\\" and not understand that it is...well, an ART. This is just plain wonderful. Hemingway again does a terriffic job, showing more of his journalistic side than in For Whom the Bell Tolls.  <br /> <br />Excellent read, but not for everyone. Get it from the library and read the first few chapters. If you still feel sorry for the bulls after that, you're on your own.	2005-10-11

It suggests a varied diet that includes carbs, but only the complex ones, not the refined ones or simple sugars.  On the one hand, it says you have to eat bread, but upon reading it, you see that you can make exchanges, such as tortillas, oatmeal, and other grains for your daily bread. <br /> <br />One reason this diet may work (but be hard to follow) is that it suggests very little saturated fat, a limited selection of meats, and no sugar.  Also lots of fluids.  You are basically restricting yourself to a small range of choices.  The author says too many choices create a cafeteria style of eating where you eat too much because you sample it all. <br /> <br />Overall, I liked the book and found it easy to understand. It is basic nutrition advice that you can find a lot of places now. I found it a bit confusing to follow exactly what you are supposed to eat and when.  I think this material would have been better presented as an article with a food choice chart. <br /> <br />That said, it was a quick read and good reinforcement of simple nutrition principles.

Paid to observe and get just the facts before writing up her stories for the New Haven Herald, Annie finds herself drawn to the story of an Ivy League sophomore whose secret moonlighting led to her violent murder. But after Annie links the girl's to a network of vice and fraud buried deep in the city's shadows, the cynical reporter is shocked to discover her own mother is involed.

I picked it up, not honestly expecting <br />much but it turned out to be well thought out.  Plus along the <br />way of telling a good story it touches on some real problems the human <br />species faces.  As a young man I recall spending quite a bit of time <br />thinking and worrying about the possible, soon-to-be, new synthetic <br />intelligences and what the likely final consequences of that will be. <br /> <br />For some reason the issue rarely crosses my mind any more -- not <br />because I don't think it's a problem but more because it seems <br />far away, insolveable, and, mostly, because I'm tired of thinking <br />about it.  Still it's refreshing to see the question taken seriously. <br /> <br />I also very much liked the way the authors take a typical stellar <br />system, at least what looks like may be typical based on the limited <br />data we have so far, and imagined a way in which people just might <br />be able to live there.	2005-10-11

Let me get the bad stuff out of the way first: the writing of this book is a little clumsy in places, and many of the key points are repeated over and over to the point of irritation. <br /> <br />Once you get past these issues, the book is a compelling read. The main books points can be divided into two broad categories.Firstly, the areas in which the intelligence community has failed to collate the available information and how the policies that have been followed have at best done nothing to improve our safety and in many cases have made the situation worse. <br /> <br />Secondly, the information that our leaders are providing to us about the nature of the threat that we face is castigated because it is deliberately false and prevents the development of a broad debate about our foreign policy, which is in large part responsible for provoking the wrath of the Muslim public. For instance we are not hated because we are free, we are hated because our policies support totallitarian regimes across the globe that opress Muslims.  <br /> <br />As such this book is readable by both concerned/interested citizens, as well as policy makers. It's hard to object to the book's points, in part because the research is so thorough (befitting an intelligence agent who has spent a 20 year career following Al Quada), in part because the arguments are clear and well made, but largely because the actionable points are so conservative in their nature: for instance, having detailed the extent to which our foreign policy has antagonized the entire Muslim world (not just a few fanatics) and how at odds our policy is to the core values our nation was founded on, the author does not recommend that we change policy, but merely that we have an informed debate about the costs and benefits of our current policies. It is hard to conclude that the outcome of such a debate would be anything other than demands for radical change in policy, but as an intelligence agent, the author stops short of telling us what to think, he simply provides the facts as he sees them, and then allows us to form our own opinions. <br /> <br />There may be a perception that this book is politically motivated. A reading of the book does not support this view. While the author is harsh in his assessment of the decisions and the decision making process of Bush and his cabinet, he describes Clinton's policies as politically correct cowardliness and describes Reagan as a \\"great man\\". If there was  any political bias in the book I didn't detect it.	2005-10-11

Well, Gordianus continues to be entirely implausible as far as actual Late Republican Rome was concerned. But then this novel manages to obtain an eerie athmosphere, as Gordianus enters old age in earnest in a setting of civil war, chaos and impending doom, the telling of the story revolves around a savvy counterpoint structure, and the mystery is actually satisfactory and not a pretext for displaying historical erudition. I look foward to reading the next novel - something \\"Last seem in Massilia\\" didn't quite manage to do.	2005-10-11

Review of The Heart of Whiteness<br /><br />For those who choose to take the trip, Professor Jensen has charted a course, in plain English, and with few pretensions, to fuller understanding of the depth of the scars that American racism has left on our humanity.  It has infected our individual and collective psyches with a disease that is difficult to overcome: the disease of color prejudice, white privilege, white supremacy, white superiority, and white racism.<br /><br />In the same vein as that of Lillian Smith's \\"Killing the Dream;\\" or Tim Wise's \\"White Like Me;\\" or indeed with the same skill and moving passion as the F. H. Griffith classic, \\"Black Like Me,\\" professor Jensen has used his own life experience, and his considerable intellectual skills to shake not just the white conscience, but the conscience of America.  And while he cannot be blamed for not solving all the problems he raised, we must all be grateful to him for having the courage to raise them, and for doing so in such a clear-minded, passionate and committed manner.<br /><br />In this short volume, the University of Texas at Austin Professor, Robert Jensen, has demonstrated that he has acquired the necessary self-knowledge (the escape velocity needed to propel himself beyond the orbit of \\"na√Øve white supremacy\\" into the orbit of \\"fully self-conscious white supremacy\\") to break away from the comforts of white privilege.  This is an important and necessary, but as he so eloquently noted, an insufficient step on the road to overcoming the disease of white privilege, and its larger manifestation, American style white racism.<br /><br />Jensen has let the cat out of the bag: White humanity is just short of a fraud built on the quicksand of propped up privileges, unfair advantages, unjust prerogatives, structural injustices, four-century-old myths, four centuries of violence and genocide, and lies, all insulated and protected by a system of soft tyranny and spatial Apartheid.  In short, if one understands Jensen correctly, America has sacrificed all of the little humanity it has, on the altar of skin color superiority.<br /><br />As Jensen has discovered, in this his much-needed second thrust -- re-entering the old orbit of white supremacy armed with self-knowledge -- is a much trickier step than being a content, \\"na√Øve white supremacist.\\"  For, as the author has discovered, the invisible power of systemic racial hegemony is the ultimate goal, and the real name of the game of white supremacy.<br /><br />Jensen makes clear a truism seldom recognized: that American racism is no longer personal.  It no longer matters how many committed anti-racists we can summon to a given cause; or who hates or does not hate blacks; or how many skinheads roam the streets, the anti-racists cannot acquire (nor will they ever constitute) a critical mass in American society.<br /><br />The consolidation and preservation of white privilege through systemic racist power is self-defining, self-promoting, and now all but a self-regulating and self-sustaining process.  There is no longer a need to consolidate white privilege, for there can be no better consolidation than having it built in to all the structures of American power.  Destroying white privilege, on the other hand, represents a \\"clear and present danger\\" to American Society as we know it.  Taking Jensen's arguments to their logical conclusions, white identity, the very basis of white self-esteem, and white humanity are all built on the sand castle of exaggerated heroics, violence and color myths -- enforced meanings that favor puffed up interpretations of white history, and the de-valuing and denigration of blacks and other non-white peoples contributions.<br /><br />As is implicit in this brief but deeply moving confessional, if one looks deeply enough, one will discover that systemic racism transcends and thus resists all attempts at re-adjustments designed to overcome its negative aspects.  It has evolved in such a manner that it now can be seen to operate on autopilot: The laws of American social physics and of American racist power mechanics are simple and virtually immutable.  They dictate that there can be no absolute black progress relative to whites; that is, that the racist system must remain in a virtual steady-state: Black progress must ALWAYS be compensated for with equal and offsetting amounts of white progress, otherwise whites become agitated and uncomfortable.<br /><br />It is consider bad sport to attempt to close the absolute distance between the races -- either socially, economically, or politically.  Power is the name of the game.  As Jensen makes clear, it hardly matters any more what individuals on either side of the racial divide do:  The script of the drama has been written, signed, and sealed through the interlocking mechanisms of racist power: lockstep, we all have learned to play out to the last letter, our respective ascribed roles.  No deviations are allowed.<br /><br />To step outside the racist norm as Dr. Jensen has done, is to be considered a \\"race traitor,\\" and to be brutally jerked back in line and reminded that America's benign and soft racist totalitarianism is neither benign, nor soft.  And, in the end, although everything is designed to look different on the surface, taking on different textures and colors, depending on the angle, the brutal fact remains that all power alignments are fixed, immutable and must stay exactly the same -- consolidated under the insulated and ever-protective umbrella of white supremacist hegemony.<br /><br />Put yet another way, in the end, and at a much deeper level, all moves on the American chessboard have been pre-determined to promote, enable, and consolidate the \\"ways of white power,\\" and the \\"ways of white supremacy.\\" Whether it be of the \\"na√Øve\\" or of the \\"profoundly self-conscious\\" white supremacist sort that Professor Jensen exhibits, is really of little or no consequence.<br /><br />As Jensen alludes to himself:by making a virtue out of emerging demographic and moral necessity, the white supremacists have used their favorite unconscious (conscious) tactic: that of redefining and renaming racial discrepancies - this time as multiculturalism  and racial and cultural diversity -- and realigning minority interests so that they look much like the chauvinistic white supremacist imperatives they are allowed to mimic.<br /><br />Once meaning has been drained, redefined, refilled and then realigned, white supremacy is then put firmly back on track; the challenge has been averted, successfully squashed: everything can then be returned to normal but with a different cosmetic look, made to look different (even positive) while at the same time remaining exactly the same.  This \\"co-optation through redefinition and re-incorporation\\" is the newest systemic way of deflecting all new challenges to racist hegemony.<br /><br />No matter what the moves are on the American chessboard, white supremacy remains the same old Black Hole that it always has been: a closed insular mean-spirited, evil, structurally violent system from which nothing enters or escapes that does not get altered to promote, consolidate, or enable \\"the ways of racism.\\"  In the end, we are all Condoleeza Rices and Clarence Thomas': closet white supremacists, pretending that we do not know how we are being used to advance the evils of a bankrupt system.<br /><br />Jensen makes clear that racism, as expressed through the insular world of white privilege, is the gravity that holds the whole stinking system of white supremacy together.  The idea that there may yet be an anti-racist world \\"out there\\" somewhere where whites will someday voluntarily give up their power and privileges is fanciful and a highly theoretical notion that may in the end be just another illusion, or mirage (like real multiculturalism is).<br /><br />No one has yet seen, inhabited, or can even describe the steps needed to get to such a world.  And while Professor Jensen has made a heroic effort to push us out of our comfort zones -- to the frontiers of a new kind of non-racist thinking and understanding -- in the end even he admits that this will not crack the nut at the center of this peculiar American disease.  Even self-conscious white supremacy is perhaps too little, too late.  He of course cannot be blamed for this.<br /><br />What then to do?<br /><br />Even though everyone seems to understand that systemic problems cannot be solved at non-systemic levels of analysis -- that is, beneath the system as a whole -- they nevertheless seem more comfortable attacking problems of racism at these lower inherently ineffectual levels (at the community and interpersonal levels, for instance) rather than at the national level.  I think this is a strategic as well as a systemic mistake.<br /><br />If we stopped only for a moment to think, we would realize that if any of the laws we have on the books regarding racism were ever to be enforced to the letter, without deviation, racism in America would soon wither away. And, there would be no need to have to re-enact the same ineffectual laws over and over again.  \\"Paper or legal equality\\" does not work because it is not worth the paper it is written on, and that includes the U.S. Constitution.  The failure to enforce a law, over time makes it a \\"dead letter,\\" an inert symbolic fraud, like the flawed white humanity that has been used to underwrite it.<br /><br />When will whites begin to understand, that it is not just a \\"lack of progress\\" to fail to enforce the Constitution, it is a sharp stab in the heart of American humanity; it renders the Constitution a \\"dead letter,\\" a paper fraud.<br /><br />Thus, the first step we need to take is to plug the holes between democratic theory and everyday American practice; between our stated ideals, which sit on pedestals to be lauded as they collect dust, and our everyday American practice.  If disincentives were built-in to discourage this kind of leakage, we could solve the problems of racism over night.  No need for Affirmative Action or grand theorizing or any other special programs.  The Constitution either has what is needed, and thus embodies the meaning it was intended to have; or it has been commandeered by racists for a different meaning, and for entirely different purposes. It cannot be both; whites cannot have their cake and eat it too.<br /><br />When black people have confidence that the playing field is fair, they come out of their shell of disgrace and self-destructive behavior to excel.  In fact, there is no evidence to the contrary.  Likewise, when whites see fairness over the horizon, they begin, almost instinctively and always unconsciously, to back up like crabs looking for a place to hide, ways to cut corners; in search of angles to play and advantages, privileges, prerogatives, and offsets to use to give themselves an edge.  Just as blacks seem to thrive in environments of fairness, whites seem to fear them.<br /><br />Enforcing laws TO THE TEE is a simple systemic ways of building the proper incentives into the system that promote and counteract these inherent tendencies.<br /><br />Professor Jensen sits at the top of my \\"must read\\" list.  Everything he writes is timely, incisive and worth at least five stars.	2005-10-11

Bronwyn Carlton, The Books of Faerie (DC Comics, 1998)<br /><br />Having made it roughly halfway through the Sandman series, I figured it was high time to start checking out the spinoffs, The Books of Magic and The Books of Faerie. Turned out to be a good idea, on both counts.<br /><br />The Books of Faerie, at least this volume, comprises two tales-- that of how Titania came to be Queen of Faerie, and another regarding a quest to go find Tim Hunter and bring him to Faerie originally published as Arcana Annual #1. While those who haven't yet picked up the Sandman or Books of Magic series are urged to read at least a way into those first, The Books of Faerie are quite a treat for those who have wandered off into the thick layers of mythology and symbolism Neil Gaiman imbued both series with.<br /><br />As with the whole extended series of graphic novels of which this is but a part, The Books of Faerie is a treat well worth savoring. *** ¬Ω	2005-10-11

I loved the first six books of this series, but with Pillars of Creation, Goodkind seemed to lose his way. It was an okay story, but the sudden shift away from Richard and Kahlan brought the series to standstill. I applaud Goodkind for trying something different, but the experiment was an unfortunate failure, in my opinion. Shifting away from main characters for an entire book is what you do when you're re-visiting a world you've created to tell us more about it, like Bujold is doing with her three (so far) stand-alone novels set in Chalion. It's not something you do mid-stream in a continuing series. <br /> <br />Now, with the two books since Pillars, Naked Empire and Chainfire, Goodkind has returned to his primary storyline, to a degree, but has picked up the annoying habit of starting the story after the pivotal action that sets everything in motion. This is fine in a stand-alone book, but not in a series (again, in my opinion). It might even be fine in a series if it were done well, but it's not. <br /> <br />I agree with many other reviewers that this series has become a tract for Objectivism. That this was Goodkind's philosophy in the first six books was obvious; it was even a bit refreshing, since it went against the grain of the majority of the fantasy fiction out there. The difference now is, those first six books were well written; these last three aren't. Or at least, not as well. Goodkind still has a way with words, when he's not preaching. But he preaches way too much in these last two books. Richard's not even likeable anymore; even when I agree with his point, I find myself thinking, \\"My God, you're a complete jerk. Shut up already.\\" <br /> <br />The worst thing, though, is that none of these last three books really advanced the story. If they had, I could put up with the other stuff. So, why did I give it three stars? Because, objectively, it's still a pretty good read. But it's not up to his earlier standards, and it's certainly not what anyone thinking about reading Goodkind should start with. Here's hoping the next book finally kicks things into gear.	2005-10-11

I continue to find this book an excellent resource for my own practice as a psychotherapist. It's importance derives from the clarity and sincerity of the author's approach to his own patients, which he shares with the reader. Through both expository writing and many case studies Levenkron explains the motivation for those who despair of help from others and turn their anger and sadness on themselves.<br /><br />I have used the theory in this book, combined with my own experience, to successfully help in the recovery of men and women of varied ages and situations. There is a down-to-earth quality in this book that makes it accessible to every reader. In fact three of my patients in the last year brought in their copies of Cutting, with highlit passages that they found helpful.<br /><br />Self-harm is very difficult to treat unless properly understood and many of my colleagues have declined to work with people who cut, burn, or otherwise harm themselves, feeling that this behavior is a sign of suicidal intention or incurable psychosis. My hope is that books like \\"Cutting\\" will build a broad base of therapists who feel familiar and enthusiastic about treating this disorder, which causes sufferers to feel so much pain and shame.<br /><br />I've noticed some very negative comments about this book. As a counselor, I hope these irresponsible and strangely personal \\"basher\\" reviews will not discourage those who can benefit from this and other books by Steven Levenkron.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Cutting\\" to anyone who suffers with this disorder, their families, and their therapists as an easy to read and thorough approach to this topic.	2005-10-11

The first features an adventure of \\"Big\\" Johnson Bone, founder of Boneville and ancestor of the three Bones from the original series.  Jeff Smith's artwork is up to its usual beautiful standards and Tom Sniegoski's writing gives Smith plenty of opportunity to exhibit his predilection for adorable baby animals and hare-brained adventure.  The story is a self-conscious \\"tall tale\\" depicting Big Johnson as a self-aggrandizing pioneer with a tendency to get in and out of dire situations.  The story is nothing new and lacks the depth (and length) of the original Bone, but that is to be expected.  No one can write rat creature dialogue quite like Smith, but the rats are still humorous.  Less funny and even annoying is the uptight talking monkey, Mr. Pip, who serves little purpose to the storyline and never quite lives up to his intended role of comic sidekick.<br /><br />The other story, \\"Riblet,\\" features the writing of Sniegoski and the art of Stan Sakai.  Related to Bone by the presence of talking animals and stupid rat creatures, the story follows the rats' unfortunate run-in with a sadistic baby boar.  The antics that ensue are reminiscent of Woody Woodpecker cartoons and, like Woody, may annoy readers who find inflicting injury on others less than funny.<br /><br />Bone fans hungry for more will likely enjoy Stupid, Stupid Rat-Tails, but the neophyte may walk away underwhelmed and not overly interested in pursuing Bone further.	2005-10-11

I just finished reading this wonderful new manga, and I'm already dying to read the next one.  Christie, the writer of a home-made manga comes to her first anime convention with her artist/boyfriend Derek, and two of his older friends who are supposed to be acting as chaperones.  After having Derek's supreme 'jerk-ness' rubbed in her face for a few hours, Christie runs off crying and runs headlong into Matt, a slightly shy cosplayer who never takes his sunglasses off.  Not understanding why, she instantly trusts this total stranger and pours out all her troubles to him.  With snyde remarks, good advice and a touch of sympathy, he comforts her and sends Christie on her way.  But that's not the end, not even close!  Derek gets worse, Christie attempts to grow a spine and stand up to the loser and Matt just keeps turning up in all the right places.  Saying any more would give it all away.   <br /> <br />The art is free-flowing and fun, without the wooden look that several new manga artists (Japanese and North American alike) tend to have.  It has just enough super-deformed moments to keep the laughter going, but the events between Matt and Christie are what really keep the plot moving.  Buy the book and be prepared for a great shojo ride through the ups and downs of an American Anime Convention -- where anything can happen, even true love.	2005-10-11

I've reluctantly come to the realization that it is unlikely that I am going to put aside several hours (days) to write a review that such a work really merits and am dropping by to note that off all the books that I've read, this one stands out in terms of explaining clearly how everything we see around us has come to be the way it is.  The zillion things that you thought had no explanation - actually do have an explanation and Mr. Dawkins explains those beautifully! <br />Among the hundreds of things discussed include: <br />Why do human beings look so different given that genetically they are so similar? <br />What causes new species to branch off from old ones? <br />How most of the time evolution is just going back and forth and zig-zagging <br />How with evolution, tremendous changes are possible in a short time - a scientists experiments with breeding jackals <br />Why are they genetically so similar? <br />How does one explain animal species with harems? <br />How everything has not evolved towards humans - that all animals are equally modern! <br />How did the world look a 100 million years ago - did you know that scientists have different names for those oceans? <br />How do we know / prove that Atlantic ocean is widening slowly? <br />.... <br /> <br />Without a doubt, if I were given the choice of naming only one book - this would be it.  If you are going to read only one book in the next 10 years, then let it be this book. Just read a few pages at a time and you will be amazed at all that you learn.  It is so full of interesting information, that many times I felt that Mr. Dawkins should have spent some more time on a given topic - that is amazing given that the book is over 500 pages long! <br /> <br />Having read some other books, I feel that Mr Dawkins writing style has improved and become more concise over time and this book is extremely readable - don't let the big size daunt you. <br /> <br />In summary, almost certainly the best book I have read (encompassing all subjects and genre - not just on Biology) - and other than his \\"The Selfish Gene\\", no other book seems to come even close.  Outstanding effort, Mr Dawkins - I can't wait for your next book. <br />	2005-10-11

Books	5	8	23	N	N	The "First Day Evidence" Is Rock-Solid .... And It All Points To One Killer Named Lee Harvey Oswald	\\"JFK First Day Evidence\\", a 1993 publication by Gary Savage, reveals the fact that more than enough evidence existed against Lee Harvey Oswald to convict him in a court of law for the two first-degree murders he was charged with in 1963.<br /><br />And the utterly far-fetched notion that a band of clever \\"We'll-never-get-caught-no-matter-how-stupid-this-plot-sounds\\" conspirators (numbering God-knows how many in total number of plotters) could have somehow faked and/or manipulated ALL of this wealth of \\"Oswald-Did-This-Alone\\" evidence is just too silly to be given serious consideration.<br /><br />For, if ALL of the \\"First Day Evidence\\" against Oswald was miraculously fabricated by evil conspirators (without a single non-plotter noticing a thing or spilling any beans), then those people who plotted JFK's assassination MUST have surely taken a lesson or two from the late Harry Houdini (or some other magnificently-talented magician or escape artist). Because any such contrived \\"plot\\" that has every single piece of credible evidence leading investigators (falsely!) straight to the conspirators' one and only innocent \\"Patsy\\" must certainly be labelled as \\"The Most Incredible Conspiracy Plot Ever Conceived\\".<br /><br />But, naturally, many \\"CTers\\" (Conspiracy Theorists) seem to hold the exact opposite opinion regarding a goodly amount of the first-day evidence which proves, beyond any doubt, that Oswald was guilty. A large percentage of conspiracy believers feel, instead, that much of the first-day evidence proves that Oswald was completely innocent of shooting and killing both President John F. Kennedy and Dallas policeman J.D. Tippit on November 22nd, 1963. When, in fact, the first-day evidence does no such exonerating of a double-murderer named Oswald in the slightest manner.<br /><br />CTers have the tendency of blowing up every tiny little mistake and erroneous piece of information (which have all been thoroughly explained in non-conspiratorial ways) to monumentally-important proportions in their quest to prove that some sort of conspiracy existed surrounding the deaths of President Kennedy and Officer Tippit.<br /><br />The Tippit killing, of course, is a murder that was so obviously committed by only Oswald that it's probably not a stretch of credibility to say that well over half of the evidence against him in the Tippit slaying could be tossed aside, and there would still be ample evidence remaining with which to arrive at a guilty verdict (had Oswald lived longer than two days following the murder in order to stand trial). But CTers still feel there's a need to make Oswald innocent of that murder too. Disgraceful.<br /><br />Let's have a logical look at some of the \\"First Day Evidence\\" that CTers like to bring up continuously as \\"proof of conspiracy\\".........<br /><br />THE TIPPIT MURDER MIX-UPS:<br /><br />The controversy re. the \\"Revolver vs. an Automatic\\" weapon was fully explained by the DPD's Gerald Hill. Since all of the shells/(casings) were found in a small, confined area, Hill (and other police officers) had initially jumped to the incorrect conclusion that Tippit's killer was carrying an automatic weapon (which expels its cartridges automatically).<br /><br />But Oswald had to physically open his gun's chamber and had to physically remove the shells himself in order to re-load (which he was seen doing by multiple witnesses at the corner of 10th Street and Patton Avenue, which is where all four shells were found, including one that was first picked up by one of the Davis women and taken inside her residence and then later recovered by police).<br /><br />The fact that Oswald was described as \\"shaking\\" the gun in order to extract the shells also is a nifty little key piece of testimony -- due to the fact that spent shells in Oswald's particular .38 revolver had a tendency to stick, and therefore extra physical effort (i.e. shaking) of the gun was required to remove the empty shells. Again, perfectly matching what both Davis women testified to later.<br /><br />Also -- Re. the \\"mixed\\" variety of shell casings that were recovered at 10th Street:<br /><br />Four bullet shells were recovered and four bullets were taken out of J.D. Tippit's body -- but it wasn't a perfect \\"match\\" of Remington-Peters shells/bullets to Winchester-Western shells/bullets.<br /><br />CTers feel this is concrete proof that Oswald's gun was not the gun used to kill Tippit (or at least they'll say not the ONLY gun used).<br /><br />And seeing as how the majority of CTers seem to feel that a \\"Frame The Patsy Named Oswald\\" conspiracy plot was in place prior to November 22nd, here's a question that I doubt any CTer can answer in a believable manner re. the pre-11/22 actions of these amazing \\"Patsy Planners\\" -- i.e.: WHY on Earth would they (those who were seeing to every little detail of Oswald's \\"Patsy-ism\\" and \\"framing\\") make a ridiculous error like that?<br /><br />In other words, WHY in the world wouldn't the \\"Dream Team Of Patsy Plotters\\" have seen to it that there was an exact MATCH of shells found on the ground to align properly with the bullets taken from Tippit?<br /><br />These guys are smart enough to actually get such a PERFECT-looking Oswald \\"imposter\\" (so as to fool over a dozen witnesses at the scene), and they're smart enough to actually have stolen (evidently) some spent bullet shells from Oswald's own gun prior to 11/22/63, and they're smart enough to have Oswald acting like a very guilty man in the EXACT area of the Tippit crime ---<br /><br />And yet they're stupid enough to pull a mismatch boner with the bullets and shell cartridges?<br /><br />Anybody buyin' this bill of pro-CT goods? I'm certainly not purchasing it.<br /><br />A much more logical scenario has Oswald firing a fifth shot which missed Tippit (a shot which earwitness Ted Callaway always claims he heard from his car lot nearby, having never once wavered in this \\"5th-Shot\\" belief). This 5th bullet was never recovered, although there is some evidence that a 5th bullet shell WAS recovered by Barbara Davis' father-in-law (with Mr. Davis keeping the shell as a \\"keepsake\\").<br /><br />It's advisable, however, to take that father-in-law story with a grain of salt, because it's never been confirmed, and said shell was \\"misplaced\\" after Mr. Davis' death. But BOTH Davis ladies have said that it was true that Mr. Davis had picked up a shell on 11-22-63 and it was later found by Barb Davis among Mr. Davis' effects.<br /><br />CTers also need to realize the fact that Oswald had an even division of Remington and Winchester bullets (unfired) in his gun when arrested (3 of each type precisely). And those were the EXACT types of bullets AND shells that were scattered through Tippit's body and on the ground at the murder scene.<br /><br />Anyone believing in Oswald's innocence in the Tippit murder is either completely ignorant of the wealth of evidence against him -- or that person has a large \\"CT Only\\" agenda. (Or, is just a flat-out, grade-A fool.)<br /><br />Take your pick.<br /><br />THE \\"MAUSER\\" VS. \\"CARCANO\\" CONTROVERSY:<br /><br />The same kind of \\"Why Did The Plotters Do It This Way?\\" questions could be asked concerning numerous other aspects of the JFK and Tippit murders as well.<br /><br />For instance:<br /><br />Conspiracy theorists love to fall back on the info that a \\"Mauser\\" rifle was supposedly found on the 6th Floor of the Texas School Book Depository after JFK's murder. CTers want to believe that the Dallas police discovered NOT Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5mm weapon -- but, instead, a German-made \\"7.65mm Mauser\\" rifle was found on the 6th Floor. This, of course, begs the natural follow-up inquiry of:<br /><br />WHY would these Patsy-framers (bent on having OSWALD'S OWN CARCANO DISCOVERED AND PROVEN TO BE THE ONLY MURDER WEAPON IN THE CASE) \\"plant\\" the WRONG TYPE OF GUN to be found on the 6th Floor?!<br /><br />How God-awful stupid is this piece of pre-assassination \\"framing\\" of their \\"Patsy\\"?<br /><br />Also -- Do CTers believe the plotters would plant a gun which has NO ties to the so-called \\"planted\\" CE399 bullet at Parkland? Nor would this \\"Mauser\\" have been linked to any of the bullet fragments found inside the limousine.<br /><br />Sheer idiocy.<br /><br />The same line of thought applies to the \\"revolver vs. automatic\\" discrepancy at the Tippit murder site. Why let the cops think it was an AUTOMATIC for even a second if the gun Oswald has on him is a REVOLVER? Just plain stupid on the plotters' part.<br /><br />Same with the three spent shells found on the 6th Floor of the TSBD. Some CTers think that at least one of these shells did NOT come from Oswald's 6.5mm rifle. But why? Why \\"plant\\" a different type of shell that is only going to PROVE A CONSPIRACY EXISTS?<br /><br />And, the biggie -- it's the same question that can be asked of the conspirators regarding the multi-gunmen \\"Patsy\\" plot so many CTers buy into -- I.E.: Why would we (the real killers/conspirators) even want to shoot John Kennedy from a variety of different locations when our ONE PATSY is located only in the Depository? It's just plain dumb!<br /><br />Plus: Why would we (the many non-Oswald assassins) want to fire so many bullets at the target so closely together, so that witnesses can later say: \\"I heard two shots really close together\\".<br /><br />Could these Patsy-framers have BEEN more reckless and silly if they had tried? If so, please inform me as to how they could have been more needlessly reckless with their plot.<br /><br />Common sense fails to enter the minds of CTers regarding these very simple questions, IMO. (And, I guess, no such common sense entered the heads of the \\"plotters\\" either re. these matters -- that is if you want to actually believe the CTers here, and believe that some goofball assassins PRE-PLANNED all these MISTAKES and silly errors for the police to find.)<br /><br />A much more logical explanation is just what Dallas police officials Boone, Hill, Curry, et al, have said from Day 1:<br /><br />The police aren't perfect machines. They're human. And make mistakes.<br /><br />The labelling of the rifle as a Mauser was a mistake. (Perfectly logical one too at the time, because both types of rifles look similar in nature at first glance.)<br /><br />The assumption of an \\"automatic\\" gun being used at the Tippit murder scene was perfectly logical, but it was, too, a mistake. Explained by Gerry Hill fully afterwards, but no CTer wishes to believe this officer's story.<br /><br />The mismatch of shells and bullets at the Tippit scene does NOT automatically indicate \\"conspiracy\\" or \\"two killers\\" or \\"two guns\\".<br /><br />Acceptable explanations for the \\"mismatch\\" are indeed plausible. But no CTer wishes to buy into the far more reasonable explanation of a shell that simply was not ever recovered from a fifth shot which missed Officer Tippit (a shot which was heard by at least one earwitness).<br /><br />Instead, the much more UNlikely pro-conspiracy-slanted scenarios burst through the ever-so-small crack of doubt surrounding JFK's murder (re. the divergent accounts of the evidence).<br /><br />(I omit any crack of doubt re. Tippit's murder; because even WITH the mismatch of shells, the OTHER evidence is just simply way too overwhelming to believe anything other than Oswald killing Tippit by himself.)<br /><br />A huge problem with the continuing belief in crazy conspiracies that just do not follow any common sense and logic is the failure of almost all CTers to evaluate separate aspects of the case (where discrepancies in the record do exist) in the reasoned light of good old common sense -- and the CTers' failure to ever look at things from a Pre-Assassination point-of-view. I've yet to encounter one conspiracy advocate who looks at things in the pre-11/22 manner in which I've detailed.<br /><br />Another very interesting piece of first-day evidence (which could actually be categorized as \\"First Minutes Evidence\\") that leads straight to the building where Lee Harvey Oswald was located during the President's murder is the fact that EVERY single newsman who initially reported the shooting to the rest of the world (via the wire services, TV, and radio) claimed -- within minutes of the last shot being heard -- that \\"three shots\\" were fired at JFK's motorcade in Dealey Plaza (with the majority of these three-shot witnesses also thinking the shots had come from behind the President's car, from the direction of the TSBD).<br /><br />If there had been many more than just three shots fired, as most CTers believe, it's utterly remarkable that all of the people who were in a direct position to tell what they saw and heard to the world within minutes of the event, via the media, heard precisely the same number of shots that it was later determined were fired from Oswald's rifle from the Book Depository (matching precisely the THREE spent bullet shells found on the 6th Floor too).<br /><br />How did the \\"plotters\\" manage to have all of these various news reporters (Merriman Smith, Jack Bell, Bob Clark, Robert MacNeil, Pierce Allman, Jay Watson, and Jerry Haynes, among still others) hear exactly the same number of shots, a number (3) that the conspirators NEEDED to have witnesses hear in order to bolster their \\"Patsy\\" plot against Lee Oswald?<br /><br />Pretty amazing indeed, if there had, in fact, been up to 8 or 10 gunshots resounding through Dealey Plaza that afternoon (as some CTers advocate).<br /><br />--------------<br /><br />The overall evidence surrounding the JFK assassination and the J.D. Tippit murder investigation (including both the \\"First Day\\" variety of evidence and otherwise) tells us, undeniably, that Lee Harvey Oswald was responsible for murdering two people on November 22, 1963.

Being a lover of Gerard Manley Hopkins and a Franciscan friar, I had sooner or later to go in search of John Duns Scotus. How many times could I come across references to haecceitas, and his teachings on the Incarnation, Immaculate Conception, and the Trinity, before I finally asked, \\"Who is this man?\\" I was fortunate to discover Dr. Ingham's book, singular in its clarity, at the very moment when I wanted to meet the Subtle Doctor. I was doubly fortunate in that it has only recently appeared.  <br />Scotus died too young to write the Summa which might have clarified his teachings, and few non-specialists have the time or energy to wade through his dense writings. When I asked older friars about him, they could cite no book, but only the classes they attended many years ago.  <br />Dr. Ingham simplifies our reading of the Subtle Doctor by clearly stating what John Duns Scotus taught, without his endless - and always respectful - expositions of those positions with which he disagreed. She especially demonstrates the Franciscan spirit of John Dun Scotus, his optimism, gratitude, reverence, love of beauty, and joy.  <br />Scotus was more than a thinker about God, he was a lover of God. When many Christians insist upon the righteousness of God; ignoring the Son of God's obedient humility and tender vulnerability; it is good to peer into the mind of John Duns Scotus. He looks at God through the human eyes of Jesus and says with Saint Francis, \\"You are Good, all Good, supreme Good...\\" His God is happy; always and endlessly happy; and endlessly pleased with Jesus who claims every man, woman and child as his own beloved. Given his daily practice of Franciscan prayer, Scotus cannot imagine a vengeful or spiteful God. No one can make God unhappy, not even Adam and Eve.  <br />Scotus and Dr. Ingham also demonstrate the desperate need we have for clear thinking about existence; that is, ontology. If the promises of science, technology, and the Enlightenment are unraveling under the impact of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim fundamentalism; if technologically sophisticated children are being taught how to solve problems rather than how to think about problems; we should return immediately to the classroom of this philosopher-theologian. We must learn again how to do both philosophy and theology.  <br />Too many people think science has replaced philosophy when science is only one type of philosophy. They cannot compare one system of thought with another, and think that thinkers of old were only primitive. Scotus speaks clearly to the thoughtful, reveals beauty to the troubled, and offers hope to those who suffer. He assures us of what the saints have always taught us, \\"All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of things shall be well.\\" (Julian of Norwich) <br />To study philosophy is to meet mano a mano with the greatest minds in human history. This book is for people who love to think. I am half-way through my first reading of it and looking forward to my second.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

After a less than stellar effort with Sunset Limited, James Lee Burke comes back strong with Purple Cane Road.  In fact, Purple Cane (book number 11) might just be his best Robicheaux  mystery yet.<br /><br />Letty Labiche, a twin from New Iberia, is on death row for murdering a man who was an executioner in Louisiana.  The rumor is that this man abused the twins as children, but they're not talking.  There isn't much sympathy for Letty, but Robicheaux wants to see her spared the death penalty and to see that justice is served.  At the same time, Robicheaux hears from an informant that he has information about the death of Robicheaux's mother.  Mae Guillory Robicheaux left Robicheaux and his alcoholic father years ago, and her past is very murky.  The informant tells the detective his mother was a prostitute and was murdered by three cops in a scam gone bad.  This is unsettling news to Robicheaux, who now leaves no stone unturned in a effort to discover the truth.  This process causes Robicheaux to deal with unresolved issues about his mothers abandonment and come to turns with her past.  But there are those who wish to keep the truth from Robicheaux, including the Louisiana district attorney and some well-placed cops.<br /><br />One of Burke's best characters is Johnny Remata.  Robicheaux ends up saving the life of this hit man, and Remata feels he owes Robicheaux.  Remata is a complex and very intelligent man who sometimes shows a sympathetic streak.  He starts killing off Robicheaux's enemies, but also starts marking overtures to Robicheaux's daughter, Alafair.  For the first time, we get to see Alafair as a moody and defiant teenager.<br /><br />In Purple Cane Road, Robicheaux has to deal with so many issues.  Was his mother really a prostitute and a scam artist and who murdered her?  How can he protect Alafair without driving her away?  And what demons are haunting Clete Purcel to the point of self-destruction?<br /><br />Purple Cane is packed with turmoil, angst, action, a great plot and incredible writing.  Unlike many Burke books, Purple Cane has a bit of a surprise ending.  It's very rare when an author writes so many books in a series and they just keep getting better.turmoil, angst, action, a great plot and incredible writing.

I had studied one book on the subject by the russian author, but knowing that photography in the US is much more developed and professional I was striving to get a book by a professional photographer.<br /><br />I was disappointed by the book \\"Photographic Composition\\" by Tom Grill for a number of reasons:<br /><br />1. It does not cover all important compositional elements, and those that it covers are not explained in full detail. It does not explain:<br /><br />- how elements with the similar shapes, similar sizes or similar tone interact with each other,<br /><br />- the reverse perspective effect and its uses,<br /><br />- why right and left sides of the photograph differ and why, how it can be used on practice,<br /><br />- how to balance \\"weight\\" of different elements of the photograph, it touches it briefly and furthermore provides an incorrect example,<br /><br />- difference between compositional center and the center of interest, how to balance them if they are in different parts of the photo (does not match each other)<br /><br />- all signs of perspective, it does not say anywhere that overlapping of objects is a clear sign of perspective (trivial as it may sound, it still should be marked in any complete work, especially when the author covers other three elements)<br /><br />- and much much more.<br /><br />2. It does not use photographs of the best masters to illustrate the topic, neither does it show how composition works in art, which I believe is very important.<br /><br />3. Most examples are in color, while most ideas on composition are best explained using B&W photographs.<br /><br />4. Last but not least, composition is about meaning, making a message, not just how to balance different elements within a frame. The book makes this statement, but in my opinion fails to provide poverful examples, while you can fully appreciate the power of composition only by studying powerful photos with good explanation why precisely this photo is good.<br /><br />OVERALL: I believe that if you want to study composition you want to know all important considerations, not just a few and briefly explained \\"how-to-quickly-improve-any-photo-you-take\\". This books fails to provide complete approach to composition and at times can be misleading.<br /><br />I'd be very grateful if you could recommend me (and other folks that look at our reviews) a more thorough book on composition, I'm sure there must be a good book in english on that subject. Thanks!<br /><br />P.S. For those who can read in russian I advise a book by A. Lapin \\"Fotografiya kak..\\", which compared to the book by Tom Grill explains composition in full.r of composition only by studying powerful photos with good explanation why precisely this photo is good. <br /> <br />OVERALL: I believe that if you want to study composition you want to know all important considerations, not just a few and briefly explained \\"how-to-quickly-improve-any-photo-you-take\\".

Nail Gaiman, The Books of Magic (DC Comics, 1993)<br /><br />Comic books, like television sitcoms, have spinoffs when they get popular. All in the Family spun off The Jeffersons. Cheers spun off Frasier. The Sandman spun off The Books of Magic (which in turn spun off The Books of Faerie, though that could also be seen as a Sandman spinoff... it gets complicated, you know?). And yet The Books of Magic takes a whole different direction, in its first book, than one would expect from a Sandman spinoff; Gaiman mines the world of horror comics (Roger Zelazny, in his introduction, seems to have an almost horrified fascination for the depth of Gaiman's knowledge about obscure comic characters) and comes up with a foursome, called \\"The Trenchcoat Brigade\\" by member John Constantine, who are to find a young British boy named Tim Hunter, who has the capacity to become our age's finest wizard, and present to him the choice of whether he wants to become a wizard at all or not. (Presaging, one might add, a certain movie regarding red pills and blue pills that a whole lot of people seem to be fond of.)<br /><br />I am not as knowledgeable about obscure comic book characters as Neil Gaiman, and so I only know one of the Trenchcoat Brigade, Constantine. (I do vaguely remember references to Doctor Occult in my preteen reading, but those days are lost in a lot of fog.) Gaiman retains the spirit of Constantine, but as with the many authors who have been a part of the Hellblazer series over the years, puts his own stamp on the character; he's recognizably Constantine, but not Garth Ennis' or Brian Azzarello's Constantine, he's Neil Gaiman's. Which is a little odd at first, but one gets used to it relatively quickly. (I assume the same can be said of the series' other borrowed characters, but don't quote me.) The interesting thing is how Gaiman's imagination of Constantine fits so well within this world; there's always a bit of jarring when a new team takes over a comic, but Gaiman's absorption of Constantine is flawless, as if he's always been a Gaiman character.<br /><br />Very odd, and very interesting, and definitely worth continuing with. ****absorption of Constantine is flawless, as if he's always been a Gaiman character. <br /> <br />Very odd, and very interesting, and definitely worth continuing with. ****	2005-10-11

Books	5	20	26	N	N	A concise book outlining what the West should do to resist the Islamicist threat	This book came to print just after the London bombings in their underground trains (The Tube), but soon Katrina and the destruction parts of New Orleans were all anyone was talking about.  In the short term this makes sense, but our long term well being depends more on what Mr. Blankley talks about in this concise and well written book.<br /><br />The author opens the book with a nightmare scenario of European capitulation to rising Muslim political power and granting their demand that they be subject to their own courts based on Muslim law, and the censoring of public art that Muslims find offensive.  America chooses in favor of rejecting similar demands in America despite the pandering of a Republican candidate who is rejected at the polls.  Lest you think this is all fantasy stuff, you not only have the bombings in London and Madrid and the murder of Theo Van Gogh, but you have German state schools being mandated to teach Muslims a Muslim specific curriculum.  Here is a quote from a letter a teacher in one such school received, \\"Germany is an Islamic country.  Islam is in the home, in schools.  Germans will be outnumbered.  We [Muslims] will say what we want.  We'll live how we want.  It's outrageous that Germans demand we speak their language.  Our children will have our language, our laws, our culture.\\"  This is not assimilation or working and playing well with others.<br /><br />However, Blankley does not see the real problem being Islam or even the Islamofacists (or whatever you want to call the extremists).  He faults the West for being weak enough to invite the problem and for failing to deal with it properly in the beginning.  He compares the way FDR and Churchill dealt with foreign threats in the Second World War versus what our hyper commitment to multi-culturalism and individual freedoms puts in greater jeopardy.  The history lesson is quite well done and is much more nuanced than the knee-jerk critics of this book would have you believe.<br /><br />I also appreciate the way the author notes the population problem that Europe's various welfare states have created for them and why the immigration programs were begun to pay for those programs with low-end workers.  However, the assimilation has not worked out as expected (note the letter quoted above), and the growing Muslim populations (now over 10% in France) do have real political impact on policies and foreign affairs.<br /><br />Blankley also faults President Bush for not declaring war properly.  He, the author feels, should have declared war on the Islamicists and put the country on a more serious wartime footing.  After giving us a solid 160-page foundation for his program, Blankley urges us to move forward with these steps:<br /><br />-Declare War<br />-Use Ethnic Profiling<br />-Secure Our Borders<br />-Adopt National Identification Cards<br />-Chart Progress<br />-Perform Fact Based Analysis (rather than using political sensibilities to measure)<br />-Take advantage of Globalization<br />-Strengthen our Alliance with Europe<br />-Win the European Culture War<br /><br />He then sums up with why we in the West must have a common defense and why the Islamicist threat is as serious as that Nazi threat was in 1939 - 45.  His postscript notes the sacrifice our country made of 30,000 lives to hold the Philippines in order to stall the Japanese advance for five months while we prepared elsewhere for the larger fight.  He notes that we are wasting time today and wonders what the costs will be in the future for such lost time.<br /><br />It is important to remember that Blankley writes this book more about the problems with the West and its current weakness than going after Islam, although he does note the responsibility of the moderates to remove the extremist elements.  His main point is that if the West were strong enough in its true cultural roots and history that the Islamicist movement would be largely irrelevant.<br /><br />I think this is a very interestingbook.  You can decide for yourself once you read it, and I hope you do.	2005-10-11

Schelling.  Schelling is professor of Economics at the University of Maryland and applied game theory to conflict.  His focus was on the weapons issues but his ideas have been applied to a host of business issues.<br /><br /> In this review, we will apply some of Shelling's concepts to how companies fire employees.<br /><br /> Schelling says \\"uncertain retaliation is more efficient than certain retaliation\\" when bargaining and \\"the capability to retaliate is more useful than the ability to defend.\\"  Now let's get practical.<br /><br />  GOODBYE SCENARIO<br /><br /> As a verb, \\"goodbye\\" is the act of parting.  It is also an acknowledgement of parting.  A goodbye scenario assumes that once employees physically leave the building, they will never be a factor for the company's future.  The relationship was transactional and the transaction is now over.<br /><br /> If the firm defines the termination as a goodbye scenario, the firm should be guided by a business model that says, \\"What's the least expensive way of terminating this relationship?\\"  And Board members should ask tough questions about paying too much.<br /><br />  AUWIEDERSEHEN SCENARIO<br /><br /> \\"Auwiedersehen\\" is German for \\"Until we meet again.\\"  It has a more open-ended quality than the English \\"goodbye.\\"  In an auwiedersehen scenario, the assumption is that once employees physically leave the building, they may continue to be a factor in the firm's future.  But it is unclear what that factor may be.<br /><br />After their non-compete contracts are over, they may join a smaller competitor and become potential allies or opponents in your firm's efforts to develop strategic alliances or acquire the firm.<br /><br />They may join firms that touch your industry and become potential referral sources of new business for you or a potential source of caution to others about using your company.<br /><br />They may attend alumni programs at their schools and encourage/discourage graduates from joining your firm.<br /><br />Each of these scenarios assumes capability of retaliation plus uncertainty of retaliation.<br /><br />The best practical defense in terminating employees under these conditions is \\"Treat  people with dignity on the way out because the assured costs of such positive treatment are less than the potential downside retaliatory risks.<br /><br />  AUWIEDERSEHEN VS IT'S NICE TO BE NICE<br /><br /> We work with companies that treat departing leaders with dignity<br />on the grounds that  \\"it is good public relations and good for morale if we help former employees achieve a `soft landing.'\\"  This positive rationale works only in cultures supportive of such a rationale.<br /><br /> The Schelling rationale does not depend on an organizion having a specific culture for treating people with dignity.<br /><br /> It develops a contingency approach to management based on a risk assessment.<br /><br />There may be times when a \\"goodbye\\" scenario does indeed make good sense.  There are other times when \\"auwiedersehen\\" makes better economic sense.<br /><br />In applying Professor Schelling's theories, management's failure to take defensive measures with those possessing abilities and options to retaliate is is just bad economics.  One sees it at work every day.<br /><br />(...)firm.    Each of these scenarios assumes capability of retaliation plus uncertainty of retaliation.       The best practical defense in terminating employees under these conditions is \\"Treat  people with dignity on the way out because the assured costs of such positive treatment are less than the potential downside retaliatory risks.      AUWIEDERSEHEN VS IT'S NICE TO BE NICE     We work with companies that treat departing leaders with dignity   on the grounds that  \\"it is good public relations and good for morale if we help former employees achieve a `soft landing.'\\"  This positive rationale works only in cultures supportive of such a rationale.

Richard Matheson is one of my favorite authors of all time, but I have to say that his last couple books and this one in particular were very disappointing. <br /> <br />I think he has gotten lazy.  Richard Matheson has forgotten how to write anything but dialogue and minimal descriptions of what is going on.  This is not good writing.  This book is very short and very simplistic.  Coming from someone who has produced some amazing books in the past, it leaves me wondering what happened? <br /> <br />The overall story could have been great, but no time was taken to develop it.  It could have been expanded a lot to make it much more interesting.  The parts that were supposed to be scary were not built into at all, leaving absolutely no feeling of suspense or tension whatsoever. <br /> <br />The only way that this book was even worth the time was because it took less than two hours to read...and about that long to write from the looks of it.	2005-10-11

I respect the art of writing to such an extent that it is unthinkable for me to stop reading a book without finishing it, no matter how I feel about it.  As far as I'm concerned, it's an insult to the author that dedicated so much time and effort to their art.  That said: I really, really, tried to finish this book, especially since I loved the idea of an urban Buffy like character. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Damali and Carlos were the most irresponsible, reckless, self centered, irrational, egotistical, undisciplined characters I have ever read - and I couldn't stand them. <br /> <br />OK, Carlos being an arrogant jerk is acceptable - though Damali's blind attraction to such a creature boggles my mind.  The sexual irresponsibility of the millennium Neteru, trusted with protecting the world from Armageddon made her character unredeemable.   <br /> <br />I made it through almost 3/4 of the book by fast forwarding through the terribly drawn out, disturbing sex scenes where the Neteru kept getting voluntarily bitten so that they could reach sexual heights that could only be achieved by siphoning each other.

If you're like me, an entertainment industry practitioner who is cynical but still optimistic about the industry, who knows the dark side but sees the simple pleasure in a great film, album or live act, then this book should be your solace.<br /><br />Don Simpson was quite simply a mad genius who, with Jerry Bruckheimer, formed one of the greatest teams ever to work in the medium of film.  This biography goes into great details about the means and methods by which Don Simpson was able to achieve the heights of production success, with films such as Beverly Hills Cop, Top Gun, The Rock, Bad Boys, Days of Thunder, Flashdance and others.<br /><br />Even if you're not interested in the movie making process, this book worth it alone for the tales of total debauchery, hedonism and excess.  Celebrity stories that will make your hair curl, writing so vivid that you'll wonder why it hasn't been made into a film itself!<br /><br />A great book.	2005-10-11

Being young and gullible I took everything Professor Ehret said as absolutely true. This is a big mistake, as it can lead to a fanatical interest in fasting and health. Too much fasting has the same effect on the body as anorexia and can cause stroke. I know someone who had a stroke while practicing too much fasting, as that individual thought appropriate based on this book.<br /><br />Ehret's book probably does a lot of good if the reader is not too fanatical about it, and does not fast improperly. It is nice to know what foods cause mucus. However, this should not be the only book on cleansing and fasting that a person reads.<br /><br />I should soften my criticism of the book by admitting that I may very well have been successful with some version of the recommended diet if I had known about my wheat intolerance back then. I have learned that wheat causes me stomach aches, especially whole wheat. This happens on any diet, but especially on a low fat diet, such as mostly fruits and vegetables. I would recommend that you search on \\"toxic lectins\\" for more information on problems caused by common foods before embarking on dietary changes for health.	2005-10-11

A few of his recommendations I would not advise, but most are helpful and learned at his expense, not yours.<br /><br />My measure of a book like this is a question: Will the time and cost invested be rewarded in saved time and saved cost?  I think so.  Especially if you liesurely read the book a few times and the stories sink in.  The only reason I can't say it would be of certain value is that it does seem, as another reviewer pointed out, that sometimes you just have to learn by your own mistakes.  But it is a fun read with short, targeted anecdotes that at the very least let you know you aren't alone in your challenges.<br /><br />Ideal readers are any business person or entrepreneur, especially those in cutting-edge operations who can relate very directly to his stories.

A friend, however, gave it to me and insisted it was important I read it.  He told me that once I got past the name and cover I wouldn't put it down.  My friend was right.

If Republicans would have presented their political platform and policies as clearly and logically as Root, they might have had my vote long ago.

I am an avid, but amateur chef and am getting married in Fall 05. I've looked at a number of bridal books, and so far, my favorite is NOT ON LOVE ALONE by Jessie Carry Saunders. If you like Martha, you will love this book -- it's simple and restrained and elegant. It's a cookbook for newlyweds, and  has a friendlier, more intimate tone than any other newlywed cookbook I've found -- it feels like something written by a bride for other brides.<br /><br />It has a friendly, appealing feel, like the author is in the kitchen with you, telling you stories about the recipes as she teaches you how to make them. Also, it's just a higher quality book -- it's a hard cover, the pages are nice and thick, and the watercolor illustrations on every page make the book seem like something you could display on your coffee table as easily as you could use it in the kitchen.<br /><br />If you want a good cookbook, any of the various newlywed cookbooks will work fine.

I love books about islands and tropical places, too, so I was really attracted by the cover.  I hadn't read anything by Hickam so didn't know what to expect but now I'm going to go back and read everything he's written.  A little about this story.  The hero is Josh Thurlow, a Coast Guard captain, and he's in the Solomon Islands, given the job by the Marines to go find a Marine Lieutenant who apparently has deserted.  The Lieutenant is related to the President so it's a tough assignment since Josh is also supposed to kill the man.  Along the way, Jack Kennedy, yes JFK himself, joins Josh and the others, and also Dick Nixon, yes tricky Dick himself.  If that sounds sort of outlandish, the way Hickam writes it, it all makes sense.  Both Kennedy and Nixon were there at the same time.  They have this great poker game which I laughed all the way through.  I love the style of this writer and like I said, I'm going to go back and read all his stuff.  Try it, you'll like it.	2005-10-11

The book is divided into topical sections: Haunted Places, Avenging Spirits, Shadowy Corners (restless spirits), Phantom Lovers, Little Terrors (Ghosts of Children), Psychic Phenomena, and Houses of Horror (favorite stories of movie stars like Vincent Price).<br /><br />For me, the overwhelming majority of the stories were new with The Judge's House (by Bram Stoker) and Lost Heart's (M. R. James) being the most familiar.  There are stories that are frightening and others that struck me as quite tame by comparison.  The beauty of this volume is that all voices from the literary world are heard and I am sure that some stories that I found less rewarding would appeal to other readers.  For me the most frightening was the first story The Haunted and the Haunters by Bulwer-Lytton.  It is the kind of story that has one jumping at minor sounds in the house.  Equally scary was Authentic Narrative of a Haunted House, a story  by Le Fanu that I was not familiar with. The Grey House by Basil Cooper was nicely written and atmospheric but not particularly frightening; it would make an interesting film.  The House of Dust is a nicely written story injecting a bit of sex into haunted house tales.<br /><br />A story that I was very interested in reading was In Letters of Fire by Gaston Leroux (who also wrote The Phantom of the Opera.  I would not strictly categorize this story as involving a haunted house but one that has an evil room.  The book has a nice selection of stories with an informative introduction to each providing us with the location and peculiarities of the haunted house and some brief biographical data about the author.  There also is a helpful appendix that describes haunted house novels that I found intriguing.	2005-10-11

Londonderry (ironically, a cousin of Churchill) took the lead in attempting to improve relations between Britain and Hitler's Germany and, thereby, head off war.  By focusing on Londonderry (1878-1949), the reader can come to understand the various reasons why appeasement appealed to so many British politicans and the general public. <br /> <br />Of course, the interesting question is why did Londonderry so embrace the German point of view that he ended up publicly disgraced?  Certainly some personal motives played a role, most directly his desire for vindication after being removed from the Cabinet as Air Minister (not to mention his failure to be named Viceroy for India) and generally being humiliated for his visits to Germany (Goering in particular), return visits from Nazi luminaries like Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop, and very public pro-German activities and writings. Kershaw suggests that like many in his aristocratic class, facing increased dimnishment of their wealth and power, Hitler was seen as a helpful bulwark against \\"Bolshevism\\" and domestic socialist movements. In exchange for a free hand in Europe, Hitler would protect the prerogatives of the 0.1% of the population that owned 1/3 of Britain's wealth. <br /> <br />Kershaw argues that Hitler was quite masterful in his manipulation of British public opinion--and one can hardly disagree. He also successfully exploited a split in the positions of France and Britain. Through Kershaw's skillful analysis, the genesis and appeal of the appeasement movement become evident.  It is no wonder that Chamberlin fell into the trap. For Londonderry and this group, the agreement at Munich was a triumph, because it avoided war and insured a valid sphere of control for Germany. It took both \\"Krystalnacht\\" and Hitler's blatant invasion of theremainder of Czechoslovakia before Londonderry began to get the picture. Perhaps the rapid slide downward of the aristocracy after the war is, in part, attributable to the fact that many members shared Londonderry's perspective--and the rest of British society knew it. <br /> <br />As is to be expected, superb research and invaluable notes are part of the package.  Like all of Kershaw's volumes, it is well written and easy even for us Yanks to follow as he maneuvers through the ins and out of British politics of the 1930's.  The bottom line: the whole appeasement movement (which in hindsight seems somewhat inexplicable) becomes quite understandable after reading this book.  That is its greatest contribution.	2005-10-11

This book has probably helped me more than any other I have ever read, and although claiming that it is one of the most important books written would sound like hyperbole, I don't think it would be an exaggeration to suggest that it is surely one of the most relevant overviews of our situation; of evolution on a global scale, and development on an individual level. I have read lots of material covering similar areas -- including a lot of Wilson's other output -- and have experimented somewhat with some of the techniques, but before getting hold of a copy of this book I was still intermittently frustrated and neurotic as a person, once the 'insights' or 'illuminations' wore off.  <br /> <br />Reading this (while (and this is important) keeping my mind as 'open' as possible and allowing myself to critically analyze MY OWN particular favourite models through which I view things) gave me so many exciting, optimistic insights. For example, I soon realized that although I was not trapped in one dogmatic reality tunnel (partly because of my reading of other Wilson materials, as well as other linked sources such as Timothy Leary, Nietzsche, and Korzybski, and probably myriad other environmental, genetic reasons, etc.) I would still compulsively rationalize on many levels, and noticed with clarity that this was mainly down to my resitence to my own imprints on the emotional circuit and a SEEMINGLY instinctive need to think things through on a scientific-rational level where other models would have been more appropriate.  <br /> <br />I've been interested in Leary's eight-circuit model of the brain for quite some time, and before reading this book I felt almost sure that I understood it almost entirely -- from both Leary's writings and Wison's own elucidations in Cosmic Trigger and elsewhere -- but while reading Prometheus Rising I began to understand the model in a much wider sense, noticing that my previous understanding had been largely 'intuitive' in comparison. (I'm aware now that it's very possible that I still don't understand it as fully as I could, and so next time I read this book or something similar I will remain open to the possibility that I still have much to learn).  <br /> <br />The way in which Wilson adeptly links so many areas of enquiry to form coherent and workable models means that, for one thing, I began to understand the process of evolution -- which is still going on right NOW, of course -- a lot more clearly. Also, the exercises helped me gain a deeper, more practical, understanding of relativity; a more powerful knowledge of who the 'master' is who 'makes the grass green', to use the Zen riddle Wilson is fond of quoting for this purpose. Also, the beautiful pantheistic feeling I recently experienced through the use of transcendental meditation and a particularly potent strain of marijuana, began to make a lot more sense in a way that was less abstract and intuitive than my interpretation at the time it occurred. <br /> <br />There are many valuable lessons you can choose to take from this book; lessons that, if understood properly, will almost certainly help you become happier, more optimistic and capable of learning more things than you may have thought possible. It might also make you more compassionate and forgiving, especially if you take up yogic or meditative excerises. Also, as mentioned in other reviews, and linked to these other topics, are fascinating explanations of brainwashing techniques that could well help you realize just how powerful imprinting is on the brains of high primates like ourselves.  <br /> <br />These are just my own personal views, of course, so the best thing to do would be to read this book yourself. Even if you think everything I've written is gibberish, you may be surprised to find that it's an interesting, vibrant and intelligent book. Don't, though, assume that you've understood everything the book has to say the first time you read it. You may find it helpful to at least consider the possibility that you've let your pre-conceived ideas get in the way and that there is a lot you haven't let yourself understand. Don't be afraid to be critical of yourself: there's no shame in admitting you conceivably might not know everything there is to know! Just for fun, if you reach a part of the book and find yourself dismissing it as 'nonsense', try instead to entertain the possibility that the writing is actually perfectly lucid, and that it's your understanding that is flawed or too superficial. Okay, that might not SOUND like a fun thing, but try it! <br /> <br />For people who are already familiar with these kinds of ideas and inquiry, I'd definitely recommend this. It might serve you well as a manual for self-directed brain change so that you can better prepare your higher circuit functioning when this evolution thing really gets interesting! (It's speeding up right now, remember, so what better time to try and prepare yourself for a wider, more optimistic reality?)  <br /> <br />This review is probably overly dry and serious, and doesn't do justice to the book's fun, exhilarating tone. If you do, for whatever reason, find some of the ideas frightening or overwhelming in any way, always remember that you don't HAVE to interpret them in that manner, and perhaps consider working on your first four circuits to remove any neuroses before you delve further into higher circuit models. Other than that, HAVE FUN. I'm confident that this book will one day be considered massively important -- as well as Wilson's other works and the writings, models and experiments of Timothy Leary -- and I hope that by recommending it I will in some tiny way help speed that process. You can also be part of that, of course. Help wake the world!	2005-10-11

It combines refactoing and patterns.  The refactoring shows how to improve existing code in order to improve maintenance and start on the road to patterns.  I find the ideas can be used in practice and a group of us are using the book to see how we can improve the code base.  The book makes extensive use of ideas from the Martin Fowler book, so it may have helped if I had read that book first.  The examples tend to be small subsections of java code and you see how to change by applying a series of refactorings.  Sometimes the examples seem to jump so a little larger examples would have helped.  I liked that the examples are taken step wise so you can see that the code can change in an evolutionary manner.I would recommend this book for anyone doing software development.	2005-10-11

For those readers, historians, wargamers, hobbyists, etc. looking for an excellent single source of Waffen SS photographs, then look no further than this book. It is the best out there. Keep in mind that it spreads its attention to all fronts and all divisions of the Waffen SS. There are good pics of Leibstandarte, Das Reich, Totenkopf, Wiking, Hohenstaufen, Prinz Eugen, Nordland, Hitler Jugend, Frundsberg, and others.<br /><br />Try to ignore the captions except for the names of individuals and possibly for other factual information. The captions are intended for a non-discerning audience. In fact I believe the volume was initially intended as a bit of a yearbook for Waffen SS veterans. If not it should have been. It serves that purpose well.<br /><br />No matter what your feelings, good or ill, are towards members of the Waffen SS, this is an excellent look into their world. And again, no matter our feelings towards these men, they remain some of history's most professional and single-minded warriors.	2005-10-11

This a very thorough book. I continue to like it more as time passes. It has detailed instructions for weight training, yoga , and aerobics. Who else will give you a superlative set of istructions for 'downward dog', and soon after do the same for  'overhead squats'?,(usually used as an adjuct to olympic weighlifters' training regimens).  Ilg understands that the three systems must each stand alone technically to be done properly, but he also understands the synergy of the three. To paraphrase one of Ilg's thoughts: Yoga gives one the body awareness to improve at weight training, and weight training gives one strength to improve at yoga. This a wonderful insight, and it's this type of thinking that adds up to making this sytem the single best for most fitness seekers. (( It's available from  Amazon's 'new & used'  sources  for  quite a low price. )) I only have one complaint: Many of Ilg's promotional photos  show him using  yoga blocks, but the book uses no blocks .	2005-10-11

Almost simple - there is no victim, at least not yet. Someone is slowly poisoning Lord Vetinari, the local tyrant. Then, the murder occurs, but the wrong one. Rather, the wrong ones. First priest and a baker (of sorts), then two more. There are clues OK, but all the wrong ones. It's important to keep Vetinari alive. That's not because anyone actually likes the man, but because all the alternatives are worse.<br /><br />Pratchett keeps the story moving, beginning to end, and manages to wrap a number of the familiar police watchmen into the story. There's Angua - when she has her monthlies, she'll bite your head off, vegetarian or not. There's Cheri, introducing the idea of women's lib to people who've barely got the idea of women. There are alots of other disparate sorts, too, under commander Vimes. The city is peopled by trolls, gnomes, dwarves, vampires, and seemingly endless other species, at each others' throats half the time (remember the Vampires?), and it's Vimes' job to maintain peace between them. The only solution he's found so far is to racially integrate at a level that surprises everyone, especially the people involved.<br /><br />Although Pratchett uses lots of characters from earlier Discworld volumes, the new reader should feel right at home. It's a great break from a busy schedule, and a great intro to Discworld. Enjoy!<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-10-11

Even me, being a passionate afficianado of Egyptology, have to admit that when I recieved this book, I though it would be just another book on King Tut.  But it isn't.  This book is a marvelous analysis of the life and times of Tutankhamun, the heretic Akhenaten, and the tumultous Amarna period, which has fascinated and astounded historians for centuries. This book is a beautiful exhibition guide to an unearthly exhibit. If you have seen the exhibit, it's a perfect way to relive the wonderful experience again and again. If you have not, the book, with its earthy, gorgeous, full color photograhps, captures the feel of the exhibit spectacularly.

The Runaway Angels by Ramona Cleofas-Moore has brought me to a new level regarding my reading habits.  Her first chapter about the Kingdom of Heaven and the powers of the two angels, Mark and Leslie, made me wonder about the unknown world, made me wonder the perfection of life where the two angels came from.  Do they have the powers to do miracles which the author has revealed in the book?  Though I don't really buy the idea of angels too much, I found the book pretty delightful and interesting to read.  It carried a wholesome message and unbelievable miracles that referred to the status of this crazy world.  The Runaway Angels is a breath of fresh air, away from the gory topics you can find in most of the bookstore shelves. Hear me everyone, this is something your kids must read. Oh, I take that back, it is the book YOU and your kids must read.  I read it twice, and I laugh at the parts where it tickles my bones.	2005-10-11

For the one year when I lived on campus during my undergraduate days, I had a next-door neighbour with whom I played chess, and whenever he would take a piece, he would issue his war-cry, 'Blood!'  How could I not purchase this book when I saw the title?<br /><br />Edward Lasker (1885-1981), an American chess champion, may have been related to Emanuel Lasker (1868 - 1941), who was the second official World Chess Champion, a title he held for 27 after claiming it from Wilhelm Steinitz.  The term of 27 years as champion is still a record.  Edward Lasker played a famous game against Emanuel Lasker, which is recorded in this book in detail with commentary.<br /><br />This is not a how-to manual specifically, although one will get many tips, particularly about combinations, end-game set-ups, and general strategy ideas.  Edward Lasker brings in many historic games and show their strategies, and does so in both sections.  The section on 'Chess for Blood' goes into more detail about major games and master play, but even here the focus is on strategy and psychology, albeit of a different sort.  At the highest level, chess ceases to be a game (much like professional sports) - 'Such games are no fun, even for the winner.  They are the hardest work imaginable.  You play for blood!'  Lasker in this section shows a move-by-move recreation of some of his own games, giving not only insight to the chess but also into the state of mind, the psychological aspects, of what goes on during a high level chess match.<br /><br />This is indeed interesting, but the better part of the book for all but the most obsessive of chess players is the first, in which Lasker looks at the hobby aspect of chess (well, perhaps not entirely hobby).  He looks at the history of sportsmanship, good and bad, such as the sixteenth century text that advocated that the chess player try to put the sun in the eyes of his opponent as a distraction.  Lasker explores the makings of a good chess player, which includes (in no particular order) memory, mathematical skill, concentration, creativity, and artistry.<br /><br />While there are definite strategies and tactics in chess (it does sound like war, and with elements such as knights, pawns, and other military features, it makes sense to think of chess in terms of martial imagery), there is no particular science that always leads to the same outcome.  'The general laws of chess strategy are surprisingly simple and few in number.  In fact, they can almost be reduced to one single principle which might be termed the principle of mobility.'  How this principle is used, however, it dependent upon the psychology and personal taste of the player.  Lasker makes chess-playing ability out to be similar to music, where there are definitely guidelines, but also enormous range for individual style.<br /><br />This is a very personal book in many ways.  Lasker was a concentration camp survivor from the second world war, and credits chess with helping him to get through the ordeal.  When he arrived in England after the war, he was tired and seasick, and spoke no English, but did find a chess game (and he recounts this game, which he won, in a move-by-move exposition here, too).  Lasker's tale is interesting, as much chess as his own life here.<br /><br />Lasker includes a complete listing of the International Chess rules, well worth having.  The notations throughout the book are standard to chess books, and Lasker's love of the game comes through very clearly, from a boyhood obsession to a lifelong avocation that becomes a true calling.<br /><br />Check!ngs of a good chess player, which includes (in no particular order) memory, mathematical skill, concentration, creativity, and artistry.

I still remember impressive parts of this book - such as the discussion of Lear's senility - while none of the other titles made such a lasting impression. <br /> <br />As I could not find my old copy, I came to Amazon to reorder it and found two brief, scathing reviews on the web page. I consider them grossly unfair. Greer's text is admittedly a bit harder going that some others in the series, but it repays close reading. Somehow the Oxford editor let this one through without the usual brutal editing that makes the prose almost as easy to read as journalistic writing. The book  is simply not as \\"introductory\\" as others in the series, and I would not recommend it to anyone who has not already read the major plays. <br /> <br />Greer is most famed as a feminist, of course, but this text is not burdened with irrelevant gender politics (as, say, Julia Annas' book on Plato in the same series is). Greer's points on gender in this book are measured, thoughtful and surprising. She starts out with the central point that younger, humorless feminists have missed: That Shakespeare in his way adored women. I have read scores of recent Shakespeare editions in the Oxford, Cambridge and Arden 3 series, and this is one of the few discussions of gender in Shakespeare that I have found to be worth reading. (The worst discussions are the ones written by male authors who seem to believe that they need to insert a section on gender whether or not it is relevant to the play. Cf. the recent Oxford edition of Timon of Athens for an egregious example.) <br /> <br />For all that, most readers will find Greer's analyses of the major plays the high point of the book.	2005-10-11

His conclusion was that it had to do with eating natural nutrient rich food (not the processed food of the modern diet). Whether this is the case or not may be disputable. What is not disputable is the fact that teeth and bone problems developed within a generation of modern food becoming available to the natives, which can be readily seen in the numerous pictures taken by Price. My own conclusion is that eating a diet of only natural nutrient rich food, as fresh as possible, is an excellent idea.<br /><br />One unfortunate outcome of Dr. Price's book is that some people have interpreted it to justify a diet high in meat, milk and other animal products. I don't believe this is the point of Dr. Price's book.	2005-10-11

It's full of ideas that will make this more realistic- such as arranging for your own temp replacement, arranging a house swap with someone from another part of the country, presenting your sabbatical to your boss as a smart business investment, and getting a \\"memo of understanding\\" about the terms of your sabbatical in writing.  Furthermore, this book is full of checklists which will help ensure your time off is well-prepared.  Especially useful is the chapter on negotiating with your boss.  One concern- though the author strongly encourages asking for pay during your sabbatical, I think it's highly unlikely you'll get it in today's marketplace.<br /><br />My only major criticism is that this book isn't as broad-minded as it could be about the possibilities of what you can do with a sabbatical.  For example, the authors claim you'll save money by staying at home, when in fact you can often live much more cheaply abroad.  The case studies are much more inspiring, and include examples of families that successfully enrolled their children in schools abroad.<br /><br />I'm kind of surprised there isn't a new edition of this book.  Though the listing of resources are outdated (and predate widespread use of the web), the book's foundations are still relevant.	2005-10-11

This is a book that is simply cram-packed with a huge hodge podge of information!  Probably it has pretty much anything you would like to know about studies that have been done of twins---many, many ways in which they are alike or different, the types of twins (it's more than just identical or fraternal!), conjoined twins, twins raised apart, famous twins---it goes on and on and on!  I loved reading so many pieces of information about a topic I am very interested in!<br /><br />However, the book could have used much more editing, or maybe a co-author or ghost writer!  It has the feel of someone saying that they need to be sure to put this piece in, and this piece, and oh, got to cram this one in too...sometimes without much of a transition or without necessary background information or follow-up information.  Sometimes it also seemed like if the author was told anything she felt was interesting by the twins she studied, she wanted to quote them exactly on it, even when the quote didn't really make total sense without the whole conversation being there.<br /><br />But these are quibbles---I just liked the information and the tone of the author so much I wish that the book was a bit more cohesive so even more people would get through it and gain the knowledge it holds!

I have also gone to the book's web site and asked for help, but no reply after 2 weeks. <br />Finally the author implies that including a stored procedure is a matter of selecting the procedure and then providing the parameters, WRONG.

None was consistently funny over the years as Calvin & Hobbes.  It's hard to believe that it's been 10 years since Watterson retired.  It's my understanding that he is living in sem-seclusion, very rarely granting interviews (although he did for the release of this set) and spending his time painting with no desire to return to a full-time strip.  His enigmatic departure at the height of the strip's popularity will forever cement his fame.  He's the Barry Sanders and Jim Brown of Comic strips.  It's like if Charles Schulz had abruptly retired in the early 1970's.<br /><br />The Detroit Free Press has just begun reprinting Calvin & Hobbes strips and will continue for the rest of the year.  This is a great thing for perhaps younger readers who may not have been familiar with the characters.  The strip is so simple really...a boy and his stuffed tiger who Calvin imagines (or does he?) comes to life when just the two of them are together.  Calvin's over-active imagination takes them on a wild ride of adventures but some of the very best strips are when the pair are just lying about, philosophizing about life in general or picking out shapes in the clouds.<br /><br />My personal favorites were always the holiday strips, expecially the Christmas strips as Calvin was always scheming for presents or to catch Santa as he comes down the chimney.  I still love reading those.  This set collects every Calvin & Hobbes strip.  All ten years worth in a handsome three volume set.  It's a great collectors item but it's also great for reading.  It's definitely cheaper to buy this complete set than to try and buy all of the smaller collection books.  A fantastic Christmas present.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Janson	2005-10-11

Things are not going well for the imperial loyalists so the captain of the Imperial ship of the line \\"Dahak\\" takes drastic action ensuring that even if he dies, the mutineers will not succeed. The problem is that the mutineers are led by the chief engineer who has some technical savvy of his own. The destruct sequence is begun and all of the rats abandon ship and head for shelter on the nearest planet. That would be earth. The mutineers' plans to reclaim the ship, however, are thwarted and the mutineers are stranded.  <br /> <br />All of this took place over 50,000 years ago. Since then, the mutineers have subtly controlled the progress of the earth by means of such events as the Hundred Years War, the World Wars, Pol Pot and other such unsavory characters (they are BAD). A desperate group sucked into the mutiny fights a rearguard action for all these millennia. Meanwhile, the ship of the line, devoid of any crew, carries out repairs and hides itself as the moon. All of this is just prolog for the real story. <br /> <br />The ship Dahak cannot fulfill its final commands without a crew. It manages to kidnap an earthman, train him as captain and swear him in as an Imperial officer. It is then up to him to resolve the mutiny and, not incidentally, prepare for invading aliens. To do this, our gallant hero is going to have to wipe out political terrorists and quash corrupt politicians. The result is a wild but fun romp filled with action and intrigue.  <br /> <br />This is a book where it is hard to \\"suspend the disbelief\\" but managing to do so is worthwhile for its entertainment value. This is a quick and frivolous read but it is fun. <br />	2005-10-11

Some are great, others not, but they are always at least enjoyable. The man writes with so much assurance and charm that people who like deep and well-written thrillers have to love and thank him for such a great material.<br /><br />`The Constant Gardener' is a really interesting book. It has an engaging beginning that will be solved throughout the novel. Tessa Quayle is brutally murdered in a distant region in Kenya-- where the couple lives. Before her death, she and her husband --the gardener in the title-- had felt apart. Ever since they moved to Africa, she involved with humanitarian works, while he focused in his office duties. The crime will shad a new light in her life, and Quayle will learn that Tessa is far from being what he thought she was.<br /><br />In a nutshell the novel is Quayle's quest trying to find out who killed his wife and why. The deeper he goes, the more dirty he finds. He learns that her death may be linked to the pharmaceutical industry and its market in the third world.<br /><br />Le Carr&eacute; has his special gift for drawing believable plots with by characters that are very human. Quayle and Tessa are people that may be anyone's friends. The dynamics of their falling apart is very true to earth. But not only them are believable, but also the supporting characters.<br /><br />The narrative is in a worthwhile slow motion --in other words, it requires patience from the readers. But people who enjoy Le Carr&eacute;'s style will find it fascinating the way he unfolds the story until it ending. At the same time, the writer is able to touch upon serious issues like the capitalism and the pharmaceutical industry that causes at lot of harm to many countries --mostly in the third world.<br /><br />All in all, `The Constant Gardener' is quite a decent read, but it requires a lot of concentration from the reader. It is different from the fast pace explosive thrillers that are out there, but it is still very good on its own merits.l very good on its own merits. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

That's how it is in Blackbelly, a book full of small-town angst. Set in Sweetwater, Idaho, population \\"a long way from a shopping mall,\\" the book's voice and cadence fits the landscape: plainspoken, unassuming and natural. Author Sharfeddin has crafted a compelling story around Chas McPherson, a 41-year-old who wants to be left alone to tend his flock of blackbelly sheep and do the right thing -- which includes helping his dad live out his last days at home. Intimidating as he is fragile, the senior McPherson is dying from late-stage Parkinson's. You can feel sorry for him, but it's not easy to like him. His freakish past as the town's fiery pastor includes calling people out for their sins. Now that he's mute and expressionless, we don't know what he's thinking, but he's apparently more alert than the people able to walk and talk around him. His silence looms large, adding dimension and tension between he and his son, and he and Mattie Holden -- the youngish nurse willing to put up with just about anything. Sharfeddin romanticizes nothing. The old ranch and house are a dump, the sheep are dirty, and the drinking gets hard. Above it all is an earnest sheriff who's trying to figure out who burned down the house of an Iranian-American family that -- good lord -- doesn't celebrate Christmas. Nicely drawn is how the characters' personal certainties unravel. Particularly touching are nurse Mattie's one-way, slightly awkward conversations with the old man, where she keeps him going by talking about everything from 16th-century fashion to random Bible passages, which she knows little about. She works hard. And she puts up with Chas, a small man on the exterior, but a big one inside. Why would a nurse take a job in the middle of nowhere? Why is Chas the town's number-one suspect for the arson? It's why I recommend it. Throw in never-die prejudices and the complexities of political correctness, man-made sins, forgiveness, and Sharfeddin delivers an even-handed novel that touch the truths of remembering too much.	2005-10-11

Unfortunately I don't think he read the book since he does not follow the principles that the book espouses: way too much duplication, not very OO (too many if/else; poor exception handling), unthinking dependencies on implementation (e.g Axis, Lucene). <br /> <br />Hibernate and Spring are powerful tools that help in the real world and there are better places to go and find out about them without all the whining.	2005-10-11

I read Martha Beck's book and was astounded to see how accurate her description of Mormonism was. Don't pay attention to all those one star reviews. They are probably all written by angry Mormons. I think that there is one thing that they have yet to realize; it is the fact that most of those books that tell the truth about Mormonism and its lunatic, lazy founder Joseph Smith, were written by people who were related to extremely eminent personalities in the Mormon community. Martha Beck is the daughter of Hugh Nibley, Sandra Tanner is related to Brigham Young, Fawn Brodie was the grand-daughter of one of their prophets (I don't remember which one - that will probably give Mormons the opportunity to make fun of me since they apparently tend to focus on small details!), Steve Benson is the grandson of Ezra Taft Benson, etc. The list is very long, but I have not read everything. All I know is that I trust those people and the fact that they were brought up at the core of Mormonism makes me think that they know a lot more than the \\"average\\" member. Furthermore, I trust the government of the United States and all the national archives regarding Joseph Smith. I love this country and its laws. Mormons believe that the Constitution was divinely inspired: God inspired the Founding Fathers in their writing it. They also believe that polygamy, as taught by Mr. Smith was divinely inspired. Why would God contradict himself so much? He would inspire monogamy to the Founding Fathers, and then, less than 50 years later, he would inspire polygamy to Joseph Smith? How contradictory is that? Their Book of Mormon contradicts itself so clearly that I find amazing that they cannot make that out. For instance, contrary to the rest of Christianity they don't believe that Jesus IS God. However when you read Mosiah 7:27 it is clearly taught that Jesus IS God. I could go on and on, but that would not change anything. I am not a psychiatrist and I am not really familiar with brainwashing. THANK YOU, MARTHA!	2005-10-11

Sir Alasdair MacLachlan is barely accepted by the ton due to his womanizing, drinking, and gambling.  After a particularly stressful day involving an enraged husband, a bruised forehead, and a fortune telling gypsy, all Sir Alasdair wants to do is drink himself into oblivion.  A knock at his door interrupts his hard won peace and brings with it a young woman and a basket.  Both will perhaps change his life forever, for Sir Alasdair's dissolute past is finally catching up with him.<br /><br />Miss Esm&eacute;e Hamilton has left Scotland, forced from her home by an uncaring step-father.  Struggling to survive and responsible for her infant sister, Sorcha, Esm&eacute;e travels to London and searches for the man she blames for their predicament,Sir Alasdair MacLachlan.  Esm&eacute;e is determined that Sir Alasdair accept responsibility for one sin in particular.<br /><br />Sir Alasdair is very handsome, charming, and surprisingly tender with baby Sorcha.  Alasdair's fiercely passionate nature is irresistible to the mature, but innocent, Esm&eacute;e.  Beautiful, practical, and full of fire, Esm&eacute;e is a perfect match for Alasdair.  These two strike sparks off of each other and heat up a room. Oh the sexual tension!<br /><br />I am a Liz Carlyle fan and am so excited about this new trilogy!  One Little Sin is a very engaging story.  Although some of the middle chapters of the book were sluggish, this is a very enjoyable read.  Alasdair is my favorite kind of hero, I have a soft spot for rakes.  And Alasdair deserves this designation. If you're a fan of historical romances and love to see a rake brought to heel and reformed, you'll love One Little Sin.<br /><br />Annabelle<br /><br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	2005-10-11

Martin does an outstanding job at drawing in the reader with his careful character development, his care for a good plot and a story that comes across as masterful. The characters are all well developed, and I found myself skipping chapters to continue the thread of my favourite characters (I found I could do this without affecting the storyline - too much). There are many well crafted story lines that make this an excellent read for people who prefer an above average book. The world-building is solid and believable. Martin has the ability to create suspense with mere spectres, and I believe this to be the mark of a great story teller.

I heard a lot about Cornelia Funke's Inkheart book just a few weeks ago, and quickly went to the library and got it.  The book was great, though in my opinion it did not live up to the hype that people gave it.  I decided to read the sequel, though.  And, in my opinion, Inkspell does the job amazingly.<br /><br />In this second book, Funke makes the story she began in Inkheart startlingly more complex, and gives every character so much depth and so many dimensions that it is difficult to form a firm opinion about anyone.  I got this book from the \\"Young Adult\\" section of the library, but the themes that are prevalent throughout the book- life and death, fate vs. free will- and the characters that grow so significantly in its 600+ pages are ones that can keep an adult fully occupied and thinking well into the night.<br /><br />In Inkspell, Funke brings the characters from Inkheart back to the Inkworld Fenoglio had created.  Eventually, almost all of them end up back there, from the evil Mortola and Basta to the beloved Mo and Meggie.  The character who takes the shine from everyone, though, is Dustfinger.  He is far and beyond the most complex character in the story, and I loved every page he was on because so many subtle nuances were added to his personality.  For him alone, Inkspell is worth reading.<br /><br />But if he isn't enough for you, then perhaps a conscience-stricken Fenoglio, or a lovestruck Farid will draw you in.  Or a princess nicknamed Her Ugliness who promises to be very important as the series continues.  Or the new reader, with the most beautiful voice of all, Orpheus.<br /><br />Whatever it is that draws you in, I think you'll be hooked very quickly.  Cheesy as it sounds, Inkspell really does weave a spell around you, and I am really, really looking forward to the next books in this series.	2005-10-11

As a Northern imigrant gardener to the South Florida eco-system I have found Nelson's \\"Florida's Best Native Landscape Plants\\" a useful place to meet and get to know the Florida Natives for the following reasons.<br />1. He has narrowed the list to 200 of the most useful plants in Landscaping.<br />2. It is a reference book rather than a text book--using a useful format to describe each plant. The inclusion of a category for companion plants is very helpful in getting the right plant in the right place.<br />3. He presents a useful summary of the wisdom of using native plants--A point that seems so obvious to me but most imigrant gardeners and almost all plant suppliers and nursuries resist.<br />4. The layout of devoting 2 facing pages to each plant and including a close up view, a mid-range view and a full plant photo  along with very well done illustrations is unique and very helpful.<br />What would I have liked that isn't there?<br />1. Foremost the biggest shortcoming is not providing a common name index. I support his decision to arrange by botanical name, and to include common name--but in this day of easily assembled indexing I find it a major shortcoming not to have included the common name index. The result is I need another book to find many of the plants--It is a combersome way to meet the natives--usually introduced by common or nick names. Apart from this shortcoming I would rate it a shiny five star.<br />Less significantly:<br />2. Most of the pictures appear to be taken in a non-homescape or landscape setting and many are not of professional quality<br />2. The format did not include or really allow space for more information on how to care for and use the plant.<br />I find it a useful but insufficient guide to \\"meeting the Florida natives.\\"	2005-10-11

Explained below.. <br /> <br /> <br />This book is fairily basic and as such will be especially useful to those new to the 'game.' While it will be tedious for experienced market participants to brush through explainations of what a moving average is, etc--I believe we can all learn something from the straight-forward TA employed by Stan Weinstein. For example, you wont see Elliot Wave defended or charts with pitchforks drawn on them--but rather a focus on moving averages (the simple logic being that MAs cut through volatility to give a better idea of the trend,) a top-down approach (i.e. Market --> Industry Group --> Security,) etc. <br /> <br />While I hold less faith than Stan in breakout systems, it's presented here in a easy to understand manner with examples and answers to test how well you are following his instruction. This man is a good teacher, and reminds me of William O'Neil in the way he gets his ideas across. <br /> <br />Particularily useful--at least for me--were his half-dozen or so favorite indicators he gave for guessing the future trend of stock markets. <br /> <br />Stan also gives his view on when to take profit on an equity you own, when and how to cut losses, and position sizing: i.e., the other 3/4 of your investing success. <br /> <br />I don't pretend to know a lot--but from what I've seen in my short experience, there is a lot of nonsense and questionable ideas used by some people under the TA banner, but Stan focuses on the simple, logical, common sense anaylsis. Being sophisticated--rather than demanding common sense--in many things in life including TA I believe causes more trouble than good; people want to believe they can figure something out and often vainly connect sophistry with (investor) wisdom.	2005-10-11

As a Christian whose life, over the last 30 years, has been scarred by Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)/Scrupulosity, I know.  The book has helped me enormously.  At the age of 13, I began to show symptoms of OCD: the typical counting, tapping, walking back-and-forth rituals were beginning to become distracting and noticeable (Yes, I did have repeated bouts of strep throat as a child.)  Then, at 15, my parents, who had intentionally raised me without any religious training, semi-unwittingly sent me to a summer camp in Maine that happened to be Christian Fundamentalist.  Over the 2 months there, I took part in daily Bible study, heard many fire-and-brimstone sermons and was constantly encouraged to convert by the camp counselors who were all born-again Christians.  The timing of this experience with my pre-existing OCD couldn't have been worse - my intense fears about salvation, hellfire and belief in God, now fully enflamed by the camp (and the occasional Fundamentalist preacher on shortwave radio) combined with the biochemical disorder going on in my brain.  The resulting mixture was so volatile that I am still recovering to this day.  By age 16, I was literally jumping off the wall.  Caught in the throes of full-blown OCD rituals that were colored by unfounded religious notions, I was tormented throughout my high school years.  Numerous times each evening during dinner, I would get up and compulsively jump to touch the ceiling in an attempt to \\"catch\\" a blasphemous thought from reaching Heaven.  Within a year the ceiling in our kitchen was literally blackened with my fingerprints.  At the height of my suffering with this disease, my scrupulous obsessions were so fearful and the corresponding compulsions so persuasive that I was once moved to fall to my knees in the middle of a crowded high school corridor in front of all of my friends in order to achieve forgiveness for some unacceptable thought.  My parents were beside themselves with worry and thought that I might be schizophrenic.  I was shuttled between neurologist, family therapist and other \\"professionals\\", none of whom had the slightest inkling of what was going on.  This, unfortunately, was the late-70s, ten years before the world would learn about this insidious disease.  It wasn't until 1989 with Daniel Goleman's wonderful article in the 'New York Times' and Judith Rapoport's 'The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Washing' that I discovered the cause of my suffering over the previous 14 years.  A cardio-nervous breakdown at age 19 (I have the unfortunate distinction of suffering real, physical cardiac irritation when I am engaged in mental compulsions) and years of self-therapy and writing cured me of the worst obsessions and compulsions, but I was still suffering.  I began to seek psychiatric help and at the age of 30, after a costly 2 year delay caused by irresponsible warnings from the Church of Scientology (during which I deteriorated into a period of anxiety, panic attacks and frequent trips to emergency room and my cardiologist), I was finally on 20 mg of Prozac daily.  This thankfully resulted in further improvement, especially with the anxiety and panic attacks that were becoming disabling and interfering with my developing career as an executive in the international telecommunications industry.  However, mental demons in the form of persistent religious ruminations, obsessions and painful, time-wasting compulsions continued to plague me.  Fear of committing the Unforgivable Sin (From the Book of Matthew) and accidentally selling my soul to the devil were recurring themes occupying my mind for years and years.  It was only through the behavioral Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) strategies presented by Mr. Ciarrocchi in this book, that I was able to achieve some degree of normalcy and freedom from the shackles of OCD/Scrupulosity.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is needlessly suffering from The Doubting Disease.	2005-10-11

Reiss looks at these events through the eyes of young Lev Nussimbaum, and the story is remarkably fresh with a unique point of view.  There are many side adventures in the Orientalist which I found fascinating and informative (the German enclave in Azerbaijan; the \\"Mountain Jews\\" of Azerbaijan, the society of Constantinople in the final days of the empire).  All fascinating and fun reading. <br /> <br />But I had to let the fun of reading this type of book override the frustration I felt from the almost total absence of any source reference.  Basically, the author is saying \\"trust me, the story I am weaving is not completely made up.\\"  And if it had not been for the fact that it is very well written and that the numerous subjects in the book are fascinating, I could not have stood it.  At one point on P.186, there is a lengthy passage by D.H. Lawrence, but no attempt to advise the hapless reader where it came from.  There are numerous references to individuals without assigning a name to them (the driver of the car responsible for the murder of Rathenau).  There is an abundance of footnotes throughout the book, but the footnotes are equally free of any source reference or citation.  I was not sure why they were there instead of in the main body of the text. <br /> <br />You might get the idea that I did not enjoy reading the Orientalist, or that I would not recommend it.  But you would be wrong.  I am just grumbling about the nature of this kind of writing, and it is a big risk for the author.  It is more essay than anything else.  There are other books out there like it, but not many.  It is a distinctly journalistic style of telling a story, but it requires a great deal of faith from the reader.  One such book is \\"The Africans\\" by David Lamb, also a journalist, written as a story, without facts to clutter things up.  I liked that book too. <br /> <br /> <br />Another aspect of the book which I found frought with peril was the political one.  The book is told from the perspective of the wealthy son of an Azeri oil magnate who longs for the days of Empire.  The Bolshevik revolution is exploding around him as he and his father escape to Georgia, Constantinople, Paris, Berlin.  The Bolsheviks are portrayed as mirror images of the Nazis, as the model used by Hitler for the entire Nazi movement.  Many volumes have been devoted to this subject and will be in the future.  I though it was one of the weaknesses of the book and too important a subject to be left as one of the side stories.  Were the Communists the same as the Nazis?  Did they really have the same agenda or point of origin?  Was one the originator of the other?  Did they both represent the same kind of evil?  Was Stalin the same as Hitler?  Was he worse?  I found it unfortunate that the book answered these questions in the affirmative without reservation.  For me, the answers to these big questions deserve their own library. <br /> <br />That's all.

And, after reading the beauty that was The Sparrow, perhaps my hopes were too high.  With that said, I found that this book just did not measure up with what was happening in The Sparrow.<br /><br />First, Russell's timeline was stretch a bit too much this time.  The Sparrow worked on the plot at both ends and the end of the book was kinf of the actual middle of the story, where we find out the truth of was happened.  In Children of God, there is also the jumping around, but it is more disjointed and in some senses follows three timelines - a literary technique that helps her do some things, but is too confusing, at least for a dummy like me.<br /><br />Second, there was too much complexity in the plot - ambiguities in the intents of the characters and even too many characters than were warranted.  It diffused the themes of the book and made for tough slogging at times; \\"slogging\\" is what I should be doing with my text books on Hegel's philosophy, not Russell's clearly capable writing!<br /><br />Finally, I guess I just don't think she should have resolved things, the questions that were asked in The Sparrow.  I know (you have to know the end), they are not totally resolved, but the implicit suggestion is that Emilio can find meaning in his suffering.  To be honest, I have the same problem with the book of Job too, but I like the tension and unanswerable questions raised in The Sparrow.<br /><br />I wish I could rate this better, but this is my humble opinion.	2005-10-11

Forged in the challenging world of publisher marketing, the concept of this book is built around the metaphor of starting a fire. Stielstra starts by pointing out the need to isolate the group of consumers most likely to buy. He calls this primary target audience the \\"driest tinder.\\" Then, instead of spreading your marketing funds broadly, he encourages you to focus your marketing resources on this group (touch them with the match) by giving them a product experience. Then, you \\"fan the flames\\" of their enthusiasm by enabling these consumers to become product evangelists. Finally, you collect the consumer data (save the coals) so that the next time you want to communicate with this audience, you can do it effiently.<br /><br />I read a lot of marketing books. Some are full of philosophical fluff. This one is extremely practical. As technology continues to advance, it will confirm the brilliance of Stielstra's approach by enabling us to follow his advice more cost-effectively. I wholeheartedly recommend this book.<br /><br />John Sawyer<br /><br />Chief Strategy Officer<br /><br />Grey Matter Group	2005-10-11

She creates wonderful characters and situations that draws the reader in.<br /><br />Jenova and Henry share a past.  They grew up together and Jenova was always kind to Henry even when her mother wanted her to keep her distance.  Years have passed and Jenova married another and Henry earned his place at court.  Despite these changes Jenova and Henry have remained good friends.  So when Jenova sends word that she would like Henry to come to her holdings, Henry wastes no time and goes to his friend.  He has no idea that this time things will be different.  Very different.<br /><br />Henry is handsome of face and form, trusted by the King and knights alike.  When his good friend Jenova requests that he attend her he does.  This widow has always had a small piece of his heart and he will do what he must for her.  He is shocked when he finds out that she plans to marry again. Why he should feel this way concerns him but he puts it off.  Then they take a ride and find themselves in need of shelter when a snow storm approaches.  This is just the spark that needs to be set to the kindle that is their attraction.  Now that he has tasted the sweetness of Jenova's kiss he wants more but she is promised to another.  Will he forsake all in order to make her his bride or will he step back and allow another to call her wife?<br /><br />Jenova and Henry are wonderfully constructed characters and this story is really very good.  Ms. Bennett knows how to weave a story that will captivate the reader.  It was entertaining to finally read Henry's story and Ms. Bennett did well by him.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-10-11

It also prompted him to buy several jazz CDs, as well as comedy CDs of Chris Rock and Richard Pryor.  <br />I find this book to be self-indulgent, and more than a little repetitive. Jaiya John says the same thing in every chapter: He had a good life, with good parents, but felt disconnected from his family and friends because his race wasn't something he could talk about. This book would have been an excellent memoir, and an important piece of literature for those adopting black children, if it had been better edited. <br />The poetry in this book is beautiful, and it may be worth reading just for that. Jaiya John overdoes the prose, however, continually using several adjectives, adverbs, metaphors, and similes to describe each detail of his life. A person cannot just say something, he or she \\"tenderly tells\\" or \\"let [words] pass through their lips.\\" The same points are hammered page after page. Somehow, the childhood he conveys is one in which he suffered pain, shame, embarassment, and low self esteem. He writes that his brother Greg (also black) must have had the same thoughts too, but Jaiya John apparently either didn't ask him or Greg didn't want his opinions in the book. Jaiya John often speaks for other people, and we're left with an incomplete picture of his life. <br />I know I'm going to take a pounding for this, but this book is not the best one about transracial adoption. Other than this man's self-pity, there are maybe a dozen salient points put forth. The rest is redundant and overdone.	2005-10-11

It is the thrilling story from before man's emergence to the moment man chose the horse to be the companion of his infinite enterprise to the present. <br /> <br />This exquisite volume is the result of years of elaborate research by a brilliant international staff of experts headed by Luigi Gianoli, who himself has devoted a lifetime to the subject. <br /> <br />Here is the horse of millennia ago - man's favorite food on the Asian and European steppes; the Mongolian horse that carried the terrifying hordes against Egypt, China, and Rome; here are the invention of saddle, stirrups, shoes; the unique refinement of the horse for combat; the beginnings of Olympic chariot races, postal service, roads; and the origin of veterinary medicine. Here are the Middle Ages breeds bearing knights to love and holy war; equitation from its beginnings to its most sophisticated, and the origin of the Thoroughbred. <br /> <br />Material available in the past only through rare book collectors and private libraries has been tracked down and is included here. Complete sections are devoted to the beginnings of school equitation and the teachings of the great masters - Grisone, La Broue, Pluvinel, Newcastle, La Gueriniere, D'Aure, Baucher, L'Hotte - and to the developments of the great riding school, such as Versailles, Saumur, Vienna, and Hanover. Here are the first women in the saddle (Amazons); and Caprilli, the man who revolutionized equitation and whose system is still in use; modern riding and competition around the world today; flat racing, trotting, polo, the circus, and the rodeo; and much more. A chapter is included on breeds throughout the world, including anatomy, care, and treatment of the horse. <br /> <br />The nearly 800 remarkable illustrations carefully selected from sources all over the world - some taken expressly for this edition and never before published - convey the beauty and excitement of discovery and development of the horse through the ages. They include rare photographs, engravings, paintings, and other illustrations: Lascaux cave dwellings of wild horses, antique stirrups, Pisanello's studies of the horse's proportions, school airs (passage, piaffe, persada, capriole, etc.), Caprilli and other great masters in action, modern proponents (D'Inzeo brothers, William Steinkraus, and others) in both correct and incorrect performances, bridling a horse, holding the reins, as well as famous foundation horses, scenes of the Derby, the Royal Ascot, the great races at Saratoga, Aintree, Auteuil, and many more. <br /> <br />***My Review**** <br />This is an extremely extensive book on horse history, it would probably take weeks to fully read. A very good selection for a private university research library.	2005-10-11

I own several titles from the series and each has its strengths and weaknesses.  This one shares a weakness with several of the other Short Introductions in that the topic is too exhaustive to cover in the less than two hundred pages used by Cook.<br /><br />Nothing I can offer will add or subtract from the previous reviews, but I will claim that the book is a good one and valuable for understanding the sacred text if you find it foreign.  Furthermore, it is a handy reference that I have returned to several times as recent political conversations hover around fundamentalism in general, and Islam in particular.

I am the kind of person who looks at the last page occasionally to see if I want to bother reading the book.  It did not spoil the movie for me - rather I noticed things that I might not have seen on the first viewing. <br /> <br />The background (given in this guide) was wonderful, though.  I loved Joss's candid explanations of the way his world works - why everyone speaks both Chinese and English fluently, what was behind the war (fought in Serenity valley, in part), what drives the crew dynamics. <br /> <br />I actually fell in love with the character of Jayne - which was totally unexpected - hated him at first.  But you've gotta admire someone who always speaks his mind and hang the consequences. (Of course, everyone loves Kaylee.) <br /> <br />The Serenity guide just enhances the whole Firefly/Serenity experience.  It lets you jump into Joss's world with both feet, and drift for days.

The Lincoln in the title is a car, not a President. Mickey Haller is the Lincoln Lawyer, so named because he operates out of the back seat of his Lincoln Town Car.<br /><br />Mickey Haller, a longtime defense lawyer, whose clientele has been restricted, of late, to small time criminals, pushers, abusers, prostitutes, etc. When he gets a referral from a bail bondsman friend of his named Fernando Valenzuela, things seem to be looking up. \\"This guy is a franchise\\" he tells Mickey, meaning a big hit - a wealthy client - from whom Mickey can earn a large fee.<br /><br />His name is Louis Rolet (pronounced Roolay), a real estate broker from Beverly Hills and he strongly professes to be something that Mickey has yet to see, a wrongly accused innocent man, who was set up by a prostitute. However, all is not as it seems. Louis is not as innocent as he claims and as Mickey's relationship with his client deteriorates, bad things start to happen to him. Suddenly Mickey realizes that he has seen an innocent man, a man he represented two years prior, who is now serving life in San Quentin but Rolet realizes it also.<br /><br />Not even the mention of Harry Bosch in The Lincoln Lawyer and yet The Lincoln Lawyer is still a compelling novel that ingratiates itself into your psyche. The Lincoln Lawyer is the sixteenth novel by Michael Connolly, a prolific and novel, mystery novelist. I have read every novel by Connelly and have enjoyed every one to varying degrees, with the possible exception of Void Moon. I think The Lincoln Lawyer is among his best.	2005-10-11

After slogging through this dreadful book I hope I can help others avoid making the same mistake.<br /><br />It seems incredible that this was written by a team of three authors, mostly because you'd think at least one of them would have had some kind of ear for human speech.  The dialogue here is completely artificial, even making allowance for the 20-plus years since publication.<br /><br />The characters may \\"jump off the page\\" but only because they are so artificially calculated to be memorable.  Any jumping these characters do is just another stunt to get attention; none are at all believable.<br /><br />The murder mystery was a yawner.  Perhaps the gruesome details were startling in the days before \\"Millennium\\", \\"CSI\\" and the other homicide investigation shows, but not anymore.<br /><br />Beyond the laughable dialogue and characters and the lackluster story, this book is mostly memorable for the authorial preaching about women's equality, the horrors of private gun ownership, and the evil of men in general and American men in particular.<br /><br />Tough sledding all the way here.

They were attempting to find out what made these leaders succeed while others languished.   <br /> <br />One factor recognized by the leaders is something they call 'contextual intelligence.' This is an ability to understand the times in which they are working. Through this factor, they are able to direct their company to take advantage of the times. Bill Gates and Microsoft for instance came along at just the right time to capitalize on new personal computer market. There were other software companies with competing products, but they are now just part of the history.   <br /> <br />The business leaders that have succeeded so well are put into three general categories:   <br /> <br />Entrepreneurial Innovation - Here is Microsoft, but also Ford, Disney, Wal-Mart.

A friend of mine just recently let me borrow this book. The first thing that I thought of when skimming through it, was that the poems inside of this book are all about things that I can relate to.     Usually, when a person thinks of poems, they think of things like, \\"So shows a snowy dove, drooping with crows; as yonder lady or her fellow's shows...\\" However, there's nothing like that at all along those lines in this book.

The battle the US waged against the Communists in Laos is still one of America's \\"Forgotten Wars\\" and what Jim does is give the war definition and reveals its human demension. The flying narrative is absolutely riveting--having personally flown with both Walt and Pterodactyl FACS in 0-1E Bird Dogs along the Ho Chi Minh Trail, I was instantly transported back in time some 35 years to those terror filled moments among hours of tedium...this book is FOR REAL!!! Jim does not sugar coat anything, relating the horrors of fellow FACS dying in a number of shoot downs and accidents with grim reality.  His struggles with higher ups removed both physically and mentally from the harsh truths faced by the FACS at the point of the spear make for both entertaining and ultimately frustrating reading--as the reader shares the author's angst with stupidity and lack of zeal to successfully accomplish the mission by his superiors. He gives a great look at how these mostly unknown and underappreciated warriors battled austere conditions, with humor and alcohol as their primary weapons while on the ground, and bravery and determination while in the air. This book is a great read and also an excellent primer on the plight of Laos during the US presence in South East Asia.	2005-10-11
US	19955259	R2599PPDATEBAF	1579621104	84950756	Callgirl	Books	2	31	34	N	N	Not very credible.	I collect and voraciously read books about, and by, prostitutes/prostitution, strippers/exotic/nude dancers. Dominitrixes, phone sex, etc; or, what has become collectively known as Sex Work.  Not all have been stellar, most have not provided me with anything I didn't already know and/or experienced, and some have been down right  disappointing. <br /> <br />Callgirl, when I first started it, fell within the middle range; not exactly profound, but with enough amusing anecdotes and inner reflection to keep me interested.  The argument that Sex Work is no different than any other profession is not a new one, nor is the revelation that most men seek out the Sex Worker more for companionship and acceptance than the actual sex.   As such, this book is not what I would consider a fascinating  read, as in something I just can't put down until I reach the back cover, so I have been reading it in spurts, and was about half way through when I saw the author on Oprah's After the Show. <br /> <br />Oprah did her standard preface to the interview, outlining Ms. Angell's education, background, and the tragic circumstances behind her decision to pursue a side career as an 'escort', finishing up, of course, with a plug for her (Ms. Angell's) book.  Then the interview started.  Ms. Angell, I felt, did not carry herself well.  Perhaps she was nervous, but her incessant and overblown laughter really grated on me, giving more the impression of a silly schoolgirl at her first slumber party than a confidant professional.  About halfway through the interview Oprah dropped a bomb, that Ms. Angell's educational and (straight) employment claims did not pan out with her (Oprah's) researchers.  Then Ms. Angell stopped laughing.  An unsmiling Oprah asked why she lied.  It took several minutes to get the answer, as Ms. Angell hems and haws and blathers in unfinished sentences about who knows what before finally admitting that in reality she was a high school french teacher, not a college professor as noted in the book. <br /> <br />This is what the book jacket claims about Jeanette Angell: <br /> <br />--She lectured and gave courses and workshops in sociology, history, religion, and anthropology at some of the most prestigious universities in America and England, including Harvard, MIT, and the London School of Economics.-- <br /> <br />Ms. Angell went on to explain that when she initially wrote the book it was a novel, a fictionalized version of her experiences working as an escort, hence, she was not really writing about herself, just retelling her story through a fictionalized character, but her publishers suggested that the book would do better if she presented it as a true life story, so she changed it accordingly, but left in her altered biography.  She also claimed that she retained the altered version to protect the identities and reputations of innocent parties.  Upon further questioning by Oprah--actually, it was Oprah repeating the same statement of \\"You did this to make yourself look better.\\"  Over and over--Ms. Angell finally admitted that, yes, she kept the fictionalized elements in the book to make her look better. <br /> <br />This admission has seriously changed not only my opinion of Ms. Angell, but my opinion of the book.  While the author maintains that aside from her fudging on her day job, everything else (in the book) is absolutely true.  Sorry, in my opinion she sacrificed her credibility in claiming an employment upgrade.  And if her motives were truly about protecting the innocent then she should have been up front about her distortion of the facts; disclaimers are common in cases of biographers who don't wish to or are unable to reveal the identities of innocent parties.  In not providing a few sentences in the preface, informing  readers that some details, people, places, things have been altered for whatever (supposedly) protective reasons, she has sacrificed the integrity of the entire work.  Maybe she is telling the truth, but if she is less than truthful about the small stuff--and, in actuality, lying about your education and job is small potatoes in comparison to the main subject of life as an escort--then how can I trust her providing the truth about the big issues?  In addition, in the book she goes into heavy detail about the subject(s) of her lectures, her students and the staff at the prestigious university she was, again, supposedly, working at, when in actuality she was working as a high school french teacher, so there is seriously more 'fictionalizing' going on than just a resume.  I now seriously question everything; everything is suspect. <br /> <br />So, I feel decidedly cheated; like a victim of the old Bait and Switch Game.  The main selling point of this book is that it is supposed to be autobiographical, take that away and all you have is a so so, run of the mill novel about being an escort. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

If you take that advice to the extreme, however, you end up with \\"The Game\\". When someone loves themselves too much, not only are they hugely successful with women - as the book attests - but other problems come to the fore... as the book fully explores.<br /><br />Many people who reviewed the book were shocked with the content matter, but despite all this, nobody is really complaining about the story. It's combination of seedy characters, bizarre stonemason-like secret culture create a story that proves the adage that \\"truth is stranger then fiction\\". Most men will identify with Neil. Most women will say the routines \\"work on me\\" because they want to feel important and special - the one thing this book blows apart. We learn that all of us are really the same, and we all like other people who are like us.<br /><br />Indeed, this book is more about human relationships than it is a \\"pick-up\\" manual. However, much like the Bible (as the gold leaf book presents itself), with a lot of study \\"The Game\\" will answer all your questions if you care to understand the parables presented. Everyone else will miss the message and see a good story instead.<br /><br />There are some tedious sections to the book. This, I believe, is to it's credit. Repeating the same lines over and over to a woman is boring - and the author covers this aspect by boring it's reader in places. Also, the words and acronyms used in the book will confuse a few readers, and some people won't be brave enough to delve into the dark places of male sexuality and self-esteem - and come out with any forgiveness for the characters.<br /><br />Where men are loath to kill each other, they use women to destroy each other. \\"The Game\\" covers this and so much more.	2005-10-11

Doctrinal or dogmatic injunctions to have faith cripple the rational powers of those who are just on the threshold of 'true religion/philosophy' in the mechanization of thought processes. This gets called 'religion' or the 'sacred'. So this nervy challenge to the whole game is quite on the ball, and in the current cultural/political atmosphere courageously to the point. That said, the discourses of 'faith' have a number of dimensions, and a simple change of terminology can help where genuine issues of faith have a philosophical, if not dogmatic, significance. And it should be pointed out in passing that Mr. Harris' readers might be fairly charged with a new kind of faith, in the Darwinian religion, this not being the place to go into that. Faith is not only an issue of divinity, but potentially also of questions of 'soul' or 'free will', in the Kantian perspective. There the question of what constitutes 'self' or 'moral agency' is confronted by the noumenal and the limits of our representations, likely to condemn us to a platonic cave of reduced self-consciousness. There the issue of faith in something more than oneself can arise as challenge to 'know oneself'. But of course the misuse of the term 'faith' in such a context is all too likely, and one should simply proceed to a new conceptual recasting: one should consider one's 'hunch' (not faith) as to a 'deeper self' more than mere imagination, proceeding with a dialectially skeptical 'faith' that this deeper reality might exist at one's psychological limits. There are many such issues in that vein, which point to original and lost meanings of 'faith', a term that deserves Mr. Harris' challenges, and which should be retired from discourse, short of suffering the tortoise effect of excessively dumbed down materialistic metaphysics.	2005-10-11

(My copies still have the original prices--10.95, 10.50, and 11.50--stamped in them. But that was thirty years ago! I even recall Leighton having a shelf in his office with various translations of the Lectures lined up.)<br /><br />It is sometimes claimed that the original lectures were a failure. In the April 2005 issue of Physics Today, Matthew Sands writes about the project that resulted in the Feynman Lectures. He disputes the claim that the undergraduates drifted away from Feynman's lectures in large numbers, and explains how Feynman's preface came about, and why he (Sands) finds it unduly negative.<br /><br />It has always been widely agreed that the Lectures are insufficient as a standalone textbook, and best used as supplemental reading. Feynman's approach appeals to many readers, but falls flat with others. This is not surprising, as different people respond to different ways of explaining physics. As an historical aside, Feynman and Schwinger took such different approaches to developing quantum electrodynamics theory that it wasn't immediately clear that their formulations were even equivalent. Most physicists find Feynman's approach easier to learn, but others find it unsatisfying. People are different. Physicists are different. Even physics students are different. There is not, and will never be, one book that is the best for every reader. The Feynman Lectures are great because they have been so enlightening to so many people, not because they meet the impossible standard of being clear to every reader.	2005-10-11

Both the book and the DVDs contain valuable pointers and instruction on how to correctly perform Aikido techniques.  Ultimately of course, the only way to learn any martial art is to practice the techniques over and over again.  They must evolve from 'mental knowledge' to 'body knowledge'.  That is, you must get to the point where the body executes the techniques without thinking as situations arise.  To get to this state, it is essential (particularly for Aikido) to practice with another partner.	2005-10-11

I'm writing this mostly for teachers who may get the idea to assign this book for a class.  Please don't.  It is terrible book that I, an art student, couldn't read for longer than two pages in a sitting.  It felt over my head, because even though it is categorized as an art book it is in fact a psychology book.  When I asked other students if they were having similar troubles with it, they all agreed, saying that even when they reread the paragraphs several times they still didn't grasp the concepts.  The author is far too long-winded as well and feels that she must repeat the same thing over an over to drive the point home, when really each chapter could be reduced to one question.  Moving on to the next point, a majority of the book is written in questions which makes it all the more difficult to understand.	2005-10-11

Love this series and the Dresden chronicles. <br />I realize that a hero is measured not merely by his (her) heroics, but more importantly by the villains and obstacles they overcome.  The more powerful the antagonist, the more sweet the ultimate victory.  Sacrifices and deaths along the way validate the item or person or ideal being protected. <br />But jeez, louise!  Butcher's characters never seem to get a break. <br />Halfway through this novel, i almost put it down.  It just got so depressing.  The villains so numerous and bulletproof, the deaths racking up so high, so many innocents lost... <br /> <br />I still finished it.  I cared enough about the characters to see how they ended up.  I wanted to know if any of the mysteries hinted at in the first book were answered here (some, not all by any means).  I enjoy the ideas of how 'magic' works in this particular world.  And ultimately, i enjoyed reading the book and will read the next one. <br /> <br />So i guess i offer this review as a warning...it will get worse before it gets better.  And it doesn't get all the way better, some things can not be recovered from.  But it is compelling.  Terribly well written, the characters are deep, their actions and reactions believeable, and while many writers have their 'good' characters skirt the edge of 'evil' in pursuit of greater goals, Butcher's one of the few where the 'evil' ones need to perform good acts in pursuit of THEIR greater goals.

Stephen Green-Armytage, Extraordinary Chickens (Abrams, 2000)<br /><br />I still have no idea what to say about this book. I'm sure most people didn't see it the way I did, but I really couldn't help myself. Chickens are low-level disturbance generators to me, far below the level of clowns, but more disturbing than, say, mimes (who are simply annoying rather than the stuff of nightmares). For some reason, I was rather expecting your basic book of photos of chickens doing really dumb things. This is not that book.<br /><br />Green-Armytage obviously has an affinity for these fowl. (Which makes me wonder about him.) These are portraits of various show chickens, along with notes on the various breeds and that sort of thing. I ended up looking at it rather like I look at dog shows. Half the time, I'm wondering who it was that thought breed X was actually attractive, when it actually is the kind of thing that invokes nightmares in small children. The other half of the time, I was amazed that you can find this sort of thing in nature.<br /><br />The photos themselves are impeccable. Green-Armytage knows his way around a camera, to be sure.

The stories were interesting and raw...just like I like them. That is until I got to the part where \\"Lusty Lloyd\\" writes a story about someone I love. It was unkind, ignorant, and just plain false. Had the names of these people been used, he could have been very easily sued for slander. I grew up in Ash Valley...I know these people. The title states that these are \\"His True Life Stories.\\" 207 true stories? I think not. In fact, a great deal of these stories are embellishments. I bought this book as a Christmas present, but could not give it to anyone because it would have hurt them. Had it been true, I'd let it go. But I know it's not. I was very disappointed. But if you don't care about that, then you'll probably love this book.	2005-10-11

The author's recommendation is as simple as daylight: do the job during the interview. Sounds like A-B-C: Always Be Closing!  Nice sales pitch, the headhunter, let's give it a try!  <br /> <br />I decided to apply ATH's formula to get into a Fortune 500 company.Yes, I did my research on the company, its business, competitors etc. (took me a good month of solid preparation). I created a step-by-step plan of solving a department's problems. With the help of two insiders, I got a name of a hiring manager. My people introduced me to the hiring manager. I called that manager myself; moreover, I contacted a VP of Human Resources to help me. I used the scripts and tips from ATH extensively. Oh yeah, they were so impressed with my persistence but THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO SHOW THEM ANYTHING BEFORE THEY'VE LOOKED AT MY RESUME. By all means, I tried to avoid giving them one. THEY CLEARLY TOLD ME THAT NO RESUME WOULD MEAN NO INTERVIEW...  <br />I had the same situation applying for a position at a Big 4 company and the Government. Online application process and \\"no phone calls, please\\" makes ATH's approach dead. <br /> <br />Maybe that's why Nick complains about HR people in his book and newsletters so much. There should be some other more efficient ways to get an intervew and a job.  <br />	2005-10-11

US	41560427	R8KP0CNDL26O2	0521354021	301591247	Critique of Pure Reason (The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant)	Books	5	8	9	N	N	Serious great book	Anyone who is interested in philosophy's great relics but mainly reads books in English should see the Cambridge University Press translation of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood published in 1997 sometime to check the Table of Contents on pages 85-90, and compare it with Kant's original Table of Contents from 1781 on page 125, to observe how many parts of this book have become so well known that scholars consulting this monument to philosophical thought feel a need for 132 page references to find whatever interest in Kant they might have at a particular moment.  Such a summary might have been open before Nietzsche when he wrote in section 110 of THE GAY SCIENCE that \\"Over immense periods of time the intellect produced nothing but errors. . . .  Such erroneous articles of faith, which were continually inherited, until they became almost part of the basic endowment of the species, include the following:  that there are enduring things; that there are equal things; that there are things, substances, bodies; that a thing is what it appears to be; that our will is free; that what is good for me is also good in itself.\\"  Kant was concerned with transcendental philosophy, the general problem of pure reason, but in I, Transcendental doctrine of elements, Division one, Book II, Chapter II, Section III, 3, A on \\"principle of persistence of substance\\" can be found on page 299;  Division two, Book II, Chapter II, Section IX, III, \\"The possibility of causality through freedom\\" can be found on page 535; and in II, Transcendental doctrine of method, Chapter II, Section II, \\"On the ideal of the highest good\\" can be found on page 676.<br /><br />Kant's practice of using large heavy type in the text for key terms makes his points much easier to locate in the Cambridge University Press edition, which features some of the heaviest type I ever saw in a book.  Page numbers for the A (1781) and B (1787) editions are located in the outer margins, making it easy to locate quotations by later philosophers who frequently invite their students to read the original work.  Schopenhauer, in particular, was adamant that Kant spoiled the 1781 edition when he removed pages 348 to 392 and \\"introduced a number of remarks that controverted it\\" (THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION, translated by E. F. J. Payne, Vol. 1, p. 435) in 1787.  This part of the Second Book of the Transcendental Dialectic, First Chapter, The paralogisms of pure reason, was originally intended by Kant to illustrate forms of reason which imitate logical thought, and appealed strongly to Schopenhauer as a basis for his own philosophy, which he declared had placed Will in place of Kant's thing-in-itself as claimed in the 22nd chapter in the second book of WWR, vol. 1, pp. 110-112.  Kant was not trying to make things easier for the philosophers who followed him by providing an easy platform they could use to proclaim their own views, as even Schopenhauer discerned when he complained that Fichte had \\"succeeded in turning the public's attention from Kant to himself, and in giving to German philosophy the direction in which it was afterwards carried further by Schelling, finally reaching its goal in the senseless sham wisdom of Hegel.\\"  (WWR, Vol. 1, pp. 436-437).<br /><br />Schopenhauer does not appear in the index of the Cambridge University Press edition of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON, but the index can be used to locate a few notes on Swedenborg.  In Gregory R. Johnson's Introduction for KANT ON SWEDENBORG, Kant's knowledge of Swedenborg's writings are linked to some of the key ideas in Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON.  \\"Finally, Swedenborg claims that his visions of the spiritual world do not show the spirit world as it is in itself.  Instead, his visions are spatio-temporal representations of a non-spatio-temporal reality.  Spiritual realities take on this spatio-temporal garb to accommodate themselves to the requirements of a finite intellect.  These teachings presage such central tenets of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON (1781, 1787) as transcendental idealism and the ideality of space and time.\\"  (KANT ON SWEDENBORG, p. xviii).  The notes about Swedenborg on pages 731 and 753 of Kant's CRITIQUE call attention to his \\"ironic attack on Swedenborgian spiritualism in DREAMS OF A SPIRIT-SEER (1766)\\" and spiritual qualities lampooned then which reappear in Kant's elucidation of the limits imposed by the general conditions of experience:<br /><br />\\" . . . or a special fundamental power of our mind to intuit the future (not merely, say, to deduce it), or, finally, a faculty of our minds to stand in a community of thoughts with other men (no matter how distant they may be) -- these are concepts the possibility of which is entirely groundless, because it cannot be grounded in experience and its known laws, and without this it is an arbitrary combination of thoughts that, although it contains no contradiction, still can make no claim to objective reality, thus to the possibility of the sort of object that one would here think.  As far as reality is concerned, it is evidently intrinsically forbidden to think it in concreto without getting help from experience, because it can only pertain to sensation, as the matter of experience, and does not concern the form of the relation that one can always play with in fictions.\\"  (CPR, A 222-223, B 270, p. 324).<br /><br />For example of Kant's always already unthink fictions, I would like to suggest the experience of a rock concert, in which a crowd knows the most popular song of the evening.  It could be Liz Phair, doing a recent song, `stars and planets' in which \\"You know it's just the same old story.  Stars rise and stars fall.  But the ones that shine the brightest aren't stars at all.  They're the planets just like us. . . .  They're the planets that unite us.  And from big to small.  We all shine shine shine.\\"  So we are.chings presage such central tenets of Kant's CRITIQUE OF PURE REASON (1781, 1787) as transcendental idealism and the ideality of space and time.\\"  (KANT ON SWEDENBORG, p. xviii).

Born into the world with \\"bastard\\" stamped on her birth certificate, Bone is full of uncertainty. As Bone grows up, money problems get tighter and tighter, Daddy Glen starts to molest and brutally beat Bone to take out his frustration. Bone's life spirals out of control and she realizes she may never have what she desperately needs-safety. Dorothy Allison portrays Bone with a harsh personality that invigorates Bone's character. Although Bastard out of Carolina is Allison's first novel, it has the lasting effect of a classic, with the raw reality of a tragedy. Bone's southern \\"trash\\" family is witty and invariably compelling. I especially enjoyed the tales that Bone's grandmother told. Although she was anything but sophisticated, her stories were shrewd and full of life, even if they were greatly enhanced. In the end, Bone's deep confusion as to who she is, mixed with her complete understanding of the world around her, is what makes Bastard out of Carolina riveting. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

I completely fell in love with Frank.  Despite his dominant nature, his heart was still very vulnerable.  I just wanted to nestle into his arms and love him and protect him forever.  The second to the last chapter even made me cry.   <br /> <br />I also liked how it was rather \\"light\\" on the BDSM elements.  The games they played, while very erotic, seemed milder than those portrayed in many other books.  The focus wasn't on weird, sadistic acts of pain, but on their love and need for one another.  It was, at heart, a love story.  <br /> <br />The only thing that I didn't particularly care for were certain aspects of Kristine's personality.  I just had a hard time relating to her character in some ways.  I'm more of a shy, modest girl and had difficulty relating to the whole stripper, drinking, partying scene...and her indignation to some of Frank's actions.  I just would have reacted differently had I been in her place.  Also, her diction didn't seem very lady-like.  Some words in her narration just seemed a little unclassy to me.  Her character works great with the story, and she was very likeable, but I do think I would have enjoyed the book a bit more if I'd been able to relate to her better.  <br /> <br />Anyway, excellent book.

I can see why someone should make such a comment, but my feeling is: why does it really need to? For sure the author could, if he had wanted, have created an artificial link between the examples. But one of the features of these 101 books, as far as I am concerned, is that the 101 segments are self-contained. It is pleasant being able to play over a small chunk at a time. <br /> <br />Fortunately for us, presented with such a broad and fascinating subject as Strategy, the author has stuck to his guns. Dunnington's 101 strategies have the look of being collated from years of traning, and observation of master games.  <br /> <br />The simple fact is this: your opponents will be unfamiliar with many of these strategies. Because you will have read about them, you will know precisely the plans and aims in certain positions. When you think about it, that advantage is going to win you some points.  <br /> <br />Buy ths book if you want an arsenal of new ideas to use in our games.	2005-10-11

She told me to skip the exercises - to spend the day, read the book through, and get back to work.      The first part of the book, King's life story, was interesting, offering encouragement to this author who has lived life mostly in the ditches, rarely on the main road.    The other part is filled with great little tidbits for the experienced-but-unpublished author.  Especially helpful were his lecture on telling the truth about life and your characters - Don't give a damn about what the world thinks, be true to your story and characters.

The reader is treated to a kind of survey of the private homes of these extraordinary men and women who put as much care and creativity into the design and furbishing of their homes and gardens as they did their paintings. The artists featured include Andre Derain, Frantisek Bilek, Frederic Church, Alphonse Mucha, Rene Magreitte, Rosa Bonheur, Gustave Moreau, William Morris, Gabrielle Munter, James Ensor, Claude Money, Alfred Kubin, Giorgio De Chirico, and the members of the Bloomsbury Group. The fascinating text is wonderfully illustrated throughout with the impressively visual photography of Jean-Claude Amiel. Enhanced with the inclusion of a House Directory and a Bibliography, Artists' Houses is an strongly recommended addition to academic library Art History collections -- and would make a superb Memorial Fund Acquisition choice community libraries as well.	2005-10-11

My daughter, age 2 1/2, loves this book so much she asks for \\"stories and crafts\\" every day. I love the fact that the this book has a simple craft ideas, snack ideas, memorable songs & finger plays that accompany and are tied to every illustrated bible story in the book. This makes it easy for me do a simple family devotional with my daughter since everything I need, (except the craft and snack materials) is all in one book. And the stories, action ryhmes and songs are innovative and fun. They are so memorable my daughter has spontanously started repeating them hours after our bible time has ended, and when we sit down to do one story and she often asks for me to repeat the previously told stories as well. I orginally purchased this book when my daughter was experiencing seperation anxiety and didn't want to go to children's church so I could do something with her at home, on Sundays, but now we do devotionals from this book almost every day, we love it so much. I would recommend this book to almost anyone who wants to introduce there little one to God. Group Publishing makes a \\"Pray & Play Bible 2\\" I just ordered it since we loved the orginial \\"Pray & Play Bible\\" so much. I envision using both for years to come, and when my daughter outgrows it I will keep it to with my future Grandchildren.	2005-10-11

But, although fascinating and complex, Zweig' s explanation of that context offers more than a purely historical analysis.   <br /> <br />Through the pages, he increasingly devotes himself to what he believes to be a fight against absurd madness, ignorance and intolerance. In a time when newspapers were still a single fare of information and being published was an act of public (and social) acknowledgement, what counts is to keep sanity and common sense even if society around you seems not to; to build bridges through the correspondence with friends who can't actually be your friends anymore because they have not the right passport.  <br /> <br />And while realising that the tone of the book slowly greys as we read, we still have time to admire his soft & sharp perceptions - sometimes nave, sometimes pessimistic, even  ironical, but never cynical - and his deliciously subtle ability to perceive beauty around the most insignificant act to turn it into a highlight moment (don't miss the scene in Rodin's studio).  <br /> <br />I once wrote I like Zweig because he writes the way some of us think. Formally speaking, his exquisite ability with language makes words reach the level of the ideas they were born from without failing to communicate in simple terms.   <br /> <br />So while totally aware of my passionate defence of this book, I like Zweig's world because his enthusiastic defence of Humanism - never mind citizenships -  because his unconditional support to any manifestation of culture and art and specially and mostly because in a moment when no excuses were (and are) needed to create differences in between countries and people he found a way to make me believe.  <br />	2005-10-11

It has several funny moments, but...at what price?  Well, at $13, according to the publisher. <br /> <br />I love Saunders's short stories, and \\"Phil\\" would not be out of place in a forthcoming collection of his work.  But as a standalone edition, it's overpriced; I could see paying the premium for a limited, collectible small press edition.  But while this is a book, it is no more a novel than Nicholson Baker's Checkpoint: A Novel.  (Baker's book is a bigger offender, in the sense that it actually has the gall to call itself \\"A Novel\\"...whereas Saunders's publishers tiptoe around and call this \\"a fable.\\") <br /> <br />Other readers recommend you sample this in the bookshop before buying it.  I would warn that if you start sampling it, you will probably end up having read the whole thing before your feet begin to tire or the clerks start asking you to buy something. This is only partly a testament to Saunders's prose.  For as a product, priced similarly to other fatter trade paperbacks, this is either a skimpy novella or a heavily padded short story. <br /> <br />Glancing at Saunders's essay about the origin of the piece, I see that it started in response to a challenge by Lane Smith.  Now I really feel cheated!  A collectible small press edition with color illustrations by Lane Smith would be worth a lot more than $13.  And Saunders could still have included it in his next collection of short stories. <br /> <br />Full disclosure:  I borrowed my copy from the library.	2005-10-11

If this statement is true, then this is the ideal reference book for developers assigned the task of building web-based mapping applications. <br /> <br />Although the Web Application Design Handbook is much more than a guide for developing interactive maps, its chapters on mapping will be especially helpful to developers who need to understand when to use geographic maps and how best to accomplish that. Beginning with basic map design concepts such as data formats, appropriate use of colour, scale, projection and dealing with map error; the authors then give the reader something further to consider while looking at the various uses of spatial statistics and discussing data classification and geographic distribution methods. This section then concludes with examples of various types of maps and how each can be used, which if nothing else, should serve to get a developer's creative juices flowing.      <br /> <br />Overall this should be an excellent reference for anyone designing and developing web-based applications, and as such, developers would be well advised to make sure they always have their own personal copy handy.  <br />	2005-10-11

I have to admit, I also get nauseated (literally) in just the sight of G.W. Bush or any of his administration attempting to tell the \\"truth.\\" And what's even more disturbing are the supporter's; Blind and angry fighters with bias moral slants and empty slogans. On the other hand, PBS and Comedy Central are refreshing alternative exceptions to all of these deceptions. <br /> <br />Chomsky relates two types of democracy - one where the majority of people are politically active participants, heard, listened and considered. The other, which is what we have, is a vanguard or specialized class of representatives that do the voicing for everyone - the only participation of the public during their elections. And this is what has been both in Lenin's and U.S. liberal's idea; that of a specialized vanguard political and business class endorsed to protect the bewildered public who simply can't think for themselves. In this, modern U.S. propaganda had its beginning with Woodrow Wilson's Creel Commission and later Red Scare. <br /> <br /> <br />While former tactics used have been the Creel Commission and the Red Scare, attacks are still used unions and all political organizations with the separating and isolating of people; distracting them with consumerism, TV sitcoms and the Superbowl - to name only a few. Also the use of catchy and empty phrases as \\"Do you support the,\\" and \\"Are you for or against.\\" This is used along with many superficial forms of entertainment, gossip columns, sporting events and many other diversions. The bottom line is a One party system, a One business system, with two divisions of the same party - the Democrats and Republicans. <br /> <br />While these distractions and attacks on unions and political organizations have been very successful, they have not broken up the Churches, which act as the few places left for organization and political speeches against propaganda. An example is the recognition that war is wrong, while the government calls those against the Vietnam War part of a Vietnam syndrome, weak and sickly persons. <br /> <br />You name it - the Middle East, Central America, National terrorism - it's all been lied upon by our media and governmental official history, including the number killed in Vietnam, declaring less than a million Vietnamese, while other sources reveal millions. What do we think when other countries and groups lie about the amount of people murdered in the Holocaust? <br /> <br />It was only until the 1960's that the culture awakened unlike before. Even in highly prejudice and opinionated parts of the country, open talks can now be given. Where formerly there was both the lack of understanding and opposition, now there is still opposition but with much more understanding and at least some type of semi-organizational national movements despite all the media propaganda. <br /> <br />In our recent times with unemployment raised, lower wages, loss of health care affordability, dwindling social security, and much more poverty than before, the sitcoms, consumerism and the Superbowl are not enough. The tactics needed are to continually create new enemies to fight, new terror to control and general fear within the public; as in Saddam Hussein, Bin Laden, Castro, Quadhafi, drug traffickers, Arabs - all with our magnificent military force that wipes out these supposed tyrannies - in reality they are weak third world armies - all acting as distractions and diversions from the real truth; U.S. imperialism and abuse of labor and natural resources by the few powerful and wealthy. Cuba is likely to be next. In an effort to gain control over labor and natural resources and prevent economic independence, the strategy is to first provoke them. And then when they act under defense, they are set-up under the lie of offence as reported by the media, demanding that we defendand brilliantly crush them under patriotic morals and values. \\"God Bless America.\\" Now we can all relax with a sigh of relief now that this terrible dictatorial tyranny has been eliminated and decent human rights and values have been restored. <br /> <br />9. While the media widely publicized the jail and torture of the former Cuban prisoner, Armando Valladares, and the U.S. both commending him for his courage and then appointing him as a representative of the UN human rights commission, a much more detailed, mountainous evidence of signed affidavits of human rights commission members in El Salvador imprisoned and tortured by the U.S., and acquired by Hebert Anaya were entirely ignored by the media. Only one small blurb mentioned. And when finally released from prison, he was quietly assassinated by U.S. backed security forces.  <br /> <br />People who were polled responded against countries that occupy others illegally and perform human rights abuses. And yet all over the globe, both the U.S. and U.S. backed forces do just that, an example being the U.S. backed invasion, torture and killings of Indonesia to those in East Timor, killing over 200,000, while the media remains silent. And while Israel occupies Lebanon illegally against UN resolution 425, with U.S. backing, killing over 20,000 in Beirut, hospitals and vital centers, there is no media coverage. <br /> <br />Over the years, the media refused to report to the public the critical voices of the Iraqi democrats around the world since they condemned the U.S. friendly relations with Saddam Hussein. Only after Saddam became the enemy were their voices given any coverage. But no sooner did they voice their antiwar sentiments and opinion against imperialistic maneuvers; they were again completely ignored by the media. You can only read about them in some of the German and British press. What does this say of our democracy? <br /> <br />Chomsky gives the reasons U.S. gave for the Gulf War; Aggressors can not be rewarded and must be reversed by violence. And yet the U.S. does this all the time and no one questions their aggressions, as in their 20 years of quiet diplomacy (no attack) of South Africa's killings, 1.5 million in just the Bush-Reagan years. Again no media coverage, a hallmark sign of a totalitarian and bias culture. <br /> <br />While two-thirds of Americans polled favored peace negotiations with Iraq, the media continued to drill the government's view of no diplomacy. Meanwhile Iraq had offered total withdrawal, and again no coverage. Any who thought of negotiations were made to feel like oddballs since the media shows that no one thinks this way. And no Democrat dared speak up either. <br /> <br />While the U.S. blocks sanctions against Israel for her defying the UN in illegally occupying Lebanon since 1978, it hypocritically employs sanctions against Cuba and Iraq. And these have worked, weakening Iraq tremendously. Negotiations are offered by Iraq, but Bush refuses for the same economic exploitative reasons in a small country torn by a war with Iran. And now suddenly it is a dangerous power that threatens the entire world with lies about stockpiles of chemical weapons and WMD. The same exact tactics were used only a year earlier on Nicaragua's Manual Noriega, deceptively elevated to a large and dangerous drug trafficking threat to the world. But he had to be smashed, killing hundreds, maybe thousands of people, and restoring a vicious police state. History repeats itself.  <br /> <br />It's all about whether we want a pseudo democracy of representatives and servitude or a free democracy of active citizen participation. These are our choices.	2005-10-11

I was disappointed in this book.  <br /> <br />I found that the author introduced some interesting historical facts and then failed to follow through on these in favour of a more simplistic storyline. For instance, Elisabeth is chosen by the Emperor over her older and(arguably more suitable) sister, to be his wife. This is something I would have liked explored. The strain some of the realities of royality puts upon regular family roles. Yet, the author glances over this and has Elisabeth focus on more mundane and stereotypical things like fashion and her weight.  <br /> <br />A second storyline, only hinted at in the book, is the hypocritical stand of the Emperor's mother towards her future daughter-in-law. Since this woman also played a domineering and cruel role in Elisabeth's future (rearing her grandchildren in place of Elisabeth and even naming the grandchildren, this would have been an interesting story.  <br /> <br />What I like most about the Royal Diaries series is that these books tell us about the privileges and responsibilities of princesses. It is easy for young girls to imagine princesses have it easy but these diaries demonstrate that this is not always true: while princesses typically live a life of luxury, they also have to live up to (and under) royal responsibilities.  <br /> <br />I think Elisabeth of Hungary had a better story to tell in the royal diaries rather than the trite, stereotyped nonsense that this author settled for! As I said, I was disappointed. <br /> <br />Karen	2005-10-11

Dr. Popper, chipper veterinarian turned sleuth, has been coerced by an associate into giving advice at an ASPCA fundraising event in the Bromptons, Long Island's paradise for wealthy whatnots.  When she stops to ask directions to the event she gets splashed with mud by a handsome actor in a sportscar, only to find that she is staying at his guesthouse during the event (whoddathunk?). Meeting cute, the two find themselves semi-attracted. This becomes problematic since Jessica's b.friend is supposed to join her for her stay. At the opening night of the fundraiser, a much  despised papparazzo is killed by a giant ice sculpture.  Jessica takes the matter into her own hands and what ensues is a week's worth of dull sleuthing antics.  Accompanied by her two pooches Max and Lou, Jessica meets actors, famous locals, and is soon hobnobbing in a very casual fashion.  Meanwhile she must fend off the advances of Shawn Elliot, the actor whose house she's staying at, and trying to placate her easily irritated and mostly whiny boyfriend Nick.<br /><br />God, what an awful book.  I would have set this book down if I weren't so compulsive--I kept wondering how the heck Cynthia Baxter was going to make her plot believable.  Bad move. Putting on the Dog isn't funny or entertaining enough to warrant 368 pages.  It's most clever points are in the punny title and synopsis on the back cover.  Several editing errors only made the going more painful.  Jessica Popper, DVM, is a supposed dog expert, yet early in the book makes a comment about Schipperkes being the basis for the wolf in Little Red Riding Hood.  Uh, like, Dr. Popper, Schipperkes are all black, about a foot high and very cute/fuzzy.  OK, I give on the ears.  Wolves and Schipperkes both have pointy ears.  Four legs, too.  This was followed by a comment about a white Abyssinian basking in the sun.  Really? Abyssinians are sandy brown with almost mountain cat markings.  And they breed true to type.  So, I'm being a twit pointing these mistakes out, but I can't help but think that if you are going to write a book about an expert, then you ought to know the expert's subject or find someone who does and will edit accordingly.  And don't even get me started on Jessica's love interests...  Nick is whiny, deluded, and boring, yet the Jessica and the author both keep commenting on what a great guy he is.  Too bad no one bothers writing something that illustrates this.  Shawn Elliot's actions are attentive, kind, and thoughtful, albeit a tiny bit shallow, yet Jessica keeps acting as though he's a major moral threat.  And I know this is just supposed to be a cute book yadayada, but is it really believable that the first movie actor she meets falls in love with her?  How about his personal assistant or something?<br /><br />If your thing happens to be animal-mysteries, and you are somewhat logical, then I say skip this one or wait until Ms. Baxter gets a better editor and research assistant.akes out, but I can't help but think that if you are going to write a book about an expert, then you ought to know the expert's subject or find someone who does and will edit accordingly.

US	52255972	R3PONRXIZ1FSLG	0767915747	122269824	Holy Cow: An Indian Adventure	Books	5	5	9	N	N	The Spiritual Journey of an Atheist	The complete review, with links, is located here:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />In 1988, on her first visit to India, the author was a brash twenty-something and 'an extreme atheist, contemptuous of all religion' (p. 15). More than a decade later, transformed by a long spiritual journey through India's cocktail of gods and goddesses, she is less dismissive of faith. However, atheism is at her core, having been 'raised in a family of atheists' (p. 34).<br /><br />Sarah Macdonald's search for God is sincere, as sincere as can be expected from a non-believer. She leaves no stone unturned, no myth unchallenged. Through it all, she comes close to losing most of the hair on her head but never her acute sense of humor.<br /><br />Surely, few countries can hope to compete with the mind-boggling variety of divinity on display in India. Sarah's whirlwind tour of the gallery of gods exposes her to every major faith and more, including Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Sufism. More recent targets of devotion, such as Sai Baba, Osho Rajneesh, Yogi Bhajan, Jiddu Krishnamurti and Bollywood stars, are also discussed.<br /><br />'The only thing that can stop a bus,' observes Sarah, 'is the king of the road, the lord of the [traffic] jungle and the top dog. The holy cow.' For all their holiness, however, cows are treated dreadfully and left to feed themselves by rummaging through garbage disposed in plastic bags. Pieces of these plastic bags 'collect in their stomachs and strangulate their innards, killing the cows slowly and painfully' (p. 11).<br /><br />As we follow Sarah through her voyage, we realize that although many of the predictions, astrological readings, and palm readings fail to come true, the few that do materialize still manage to create some awe, at least in the author's mind.<br /><br />In India, 'saving face is so important that living a lie is accepted practice,' (p. 43) one that the author eventually also succumbs to (p. 46).<br /><br />She notes that the mantras recited at Hindu weddings are 'mostly all to protect the husband' (p. 63). Despite the purported rise in female literacy, Sarah finds that gold, not education, is still 'a girl's best friend - an Indian woman's social security, insurance and alimony if abandoned or divorced' (p. 54). And when things go wrong, 'death can deliver status and honor. The pull for respect and the shame of living in disapproval are stronger than the lust for life' (p. 66).<br /><br />Sarah's first foray into spirituality is a ten-day Buddhist Vipassana session with S.N. Goenka, which she describes as a 'brain enema' (p. 68). After some initial skepticism she discovers, 'silence is sensual, for my other senses are becoming heightened' (p. 73). The two Indian women in the group give up and leave on day three. It is no wonder that Buddhism never took hold in India. However, Sarah's understanding that 'the Mogul invasions wiped out Buddhism in its country of origin' (p. 150) seems to disregard the other half of the story whereby Buddhism was 'absorbed' by Hinduism and 'died a natural death in India' (The Discovery of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, p. 179).<br /><br />Next on the itinerary is Sikhism, which her friend informs her 'is part of Hinduism' (p. 65). Sikhs, who the author views as 'the Irish of India' (p. 89) for being the butts of jokes and emblematic of India's 'hair fetish' (p. 82), must, she feels, find it 'hard to look tough in a topknot' (p. 85).<br /><br />At the Golden Temple in Amritsar, 'the hairiest holy town on earth' (p. 86), she finds 'Sikhs washing the marble walkways with milk' (p. 87). She credits Sikhs for being 'the only Indians who understand that music sounds better if it's not making ears bleed' (p. 88) and describes the Sikh 'langar' (community kitchen), being cooked on fires 'large enough to bake an elephant' (p. 88), as Sikhism's 'up yours' to the Hindu caste system (p. 88).<br /><br />Located nearby is the Miri Piri Academy for Western Sikhs, converted by Yogi Bhajan and given new names according to their 'numerology' (p. 90). At the Academy, Guru Singh, famous for being 'the first white Sikh,' predicts 'it'll all end in 2012' (p. 92).<br /><br />Back at the Golden Temple, Sarah discovers that Indian Sikhs are 'confused by the turbaned white people' and view Sikhism as a 'birthright of blood . . . not for foreigners' (p. 95). S.G.P.C. official Gurbachan Singh Bachan enlightens Sarah about the special protection Sikhs enjoy from skin cancer because their hair 'absorbs the sun's rays' (p. 96). The author feels 'energized' (p. 100) by the encounter but rejects Sikhism because she isn't yet ready for God and, as she puts it, 'I hate a uniform' (p. 97). Also, she tells us, '[my husband] made me promise I won't become a white Sikh or a Hare Krishna' (p. 100).<br /><br />In Muslim Kashmir, Sarah savors 'twenty-one types of mutton' (p. 113) and finds that 'Sufism is struggling' (p. 123), 'death seems to be the only growth industry' (p. 124), and most people 'want Kashmir to be an Asian Switzerland; an independent peaceful state' (p. 119).<br /><br />Sarah finds Hinduism to be the 'least authoritarian religion' with an 'ingenious way of dealing with critics . . . Buddha rejected ancient Hindu teachings and the very existence of God, but Hindus insist that he was another avatar of Vishnu' (p. 142).<br /><br />'The river is not dirty, your mind is dirty' (p. 145), insist sadhus (saints) at the Kumbh Mela at Allahabad, where 'the three holy rivers of Hinduism meet - the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati' (p. 134). Sarah takes a 'vow not to eat meat' (p. 159) since 'the teachings of Hinduism and Buddhism have spoiled the pleasure of the taste of meat' (p. 187).<br /><br />Next, Sarah turns to 'Upper Dharamsala, or McLeod Gunj, [the] spiritual center of exiled Tibetan Buddhism' (p. 151). The Dalai Lama, she tells us, 'demands doubt, questioning and reasoning' (p. 154). She admits, 'right now the Buddhist way of living attracts me the most,' in part because 'Buddhism is proving it can move with the times' (p. 161). She takes comfort in the understanding that '[Buddha] insisted he never be worshipped or deified' (p. 163).<br /><br />The author then heads to Dharamkot to meet up with 'India's most ubiquitous travelers - Israelis' (p. 164). 'It was the Dalai Lama who encouraged the first Passover festival in this town full of exiled [Tibetan] Buddhists. In 1990, His Holiness invited a group of Jews here to ask them how they preserved their religion in exile' (p. 169).<br /><br />Rodger Kamenetz, who wrote about the event in his book The Jew in the Lotus, explains, 'After the Romans destroyed the Jewish temples, our people had to put the elements of worship into everyday life; the home is the temple, the family table is the altar and eating is divine communion' (p. 169).<br /><br />She writes, 'Most of the travelers here have just finished their compulsory service (boys do three years, girls do twenty months) and they all seem resentful and angry about a spiritual homeland that trains them to kill' (p. 166). Judaism, she says, 'is full of guilt' (p. 167).<br /><br />The reader is introduced to the varieties of Judaism. 'The Kabbalah is to Judaism what Sufism in to Islam' (p. 169). At the other end of the spectrum is the orthodox Chabad Lubavitch group, which 'only recognizes as Jews those individuals born of a Jewish mother' and believes in reincarnation (p. 173).<br /><br />The Bene Israeli of Bombay, 'believed to be the poorest Jews in the world,' insist, India 'is the only place where Jews have not been persecuted' (p. 177).<br /><br />The next stop is Zoroastrianism, 'one of the most ancient monotheistic faiths,' imported from present-day Iran, that 'probably influenced Judaism, Christianity and Islam' (p. 182), wherein 'priesthood is an inherited right' (p. 190).<br /><br />The Parsis, or Zoroastrians, are the 'most Western of India's ethnic groups' (p. 179) who 'became rich because they were firm friends with the British [who] gave them huge chunks of Bombay' (p. 181).<br /><br />The vulture they depend on 'to take them to heaven' is on the 'critically endangered' list (p. 179). Their faith 'has been polluted by the Hindu customs of their foster motherland; Parsis wear a sacred thread like Hindu Brahmans, most don't eat beef and they throw flowers into sacred waters' (p. 192). Some even believe in reincarnation. Their capacity for 'self-deprecating' humor is a rare sighting in India.<br /><br />Sarah keenly observes, 'Like Jesus, Buddha and Mohammed, [Zarathustra's] thirtieth birthday was a turning point [i.e. when he attained enlightenment]' (p. 182). She could have added Nanak and perhaps a few others to the list. She also notes with some frustration that the stigmatizing of women during their menstrual periods 'taints nearly every religion' (p. 188).<br /><br />When confronted with 'NO NON-PARSIS' signs at Parsi temples, the author pines for 'the inclusive, casual nature of Hinduism' (p. 186).<br /><br />Next on India's spiritual smorgasbord is the Mata Amritanandamayi Math in Kerala. Sarah isn't impressed by much other than Amma's stamina. 'Apparently she never has a day off and hasn't cancelled a darshan [viewing] in thirty years' (p. 207).<br /><br />In Bollywood, she seeks out Amitabh Bachchan, 'a man with three temples dedicated to him' (p. 234).<br /><br />From there it's onto Bangalore to meet Sathya Sai Baba, who 'says he is a purna avatar - a manifestation of God in human form and a coming predicted in the Bhagavad Gita, a Muslim Hadith and the Bible' (p. 238).<br /><br />Sarah is a witness to two miracles. 'Hundreds of Indians are waiting in ordered queues in total silence' (p. 240) and Sai actually manages to 'arrive early' (p. 241). Sai segregates devotees by gender, nationality and spiritual association and 'spends most of the time on the male side, chooses mostly blokes for interviews' (p. 241).<br /><br />'He has twenty-five million followers, including chief justices, an army chief of staff, ex-prime ministers, senior politicians and cricketers Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar. A court has already ruled his gold comes from God and it seems there aren't any Indian investigations into the sexual allegations' (pp. 241-2). Sai has said 'he will die in 2020' and be reborn as 'Prema (love) in Gunaparthy, Karnataka' eight years later (p. 242).<br /><br />After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, Sarah notes, 'As I feared, there won't be any forgiveness or compassion, there will be more death and another cycle of hate' (p. 257). In a moment of despondency she turns spiritual when her husband departs to Kabul on an assignment for the Australian Broadcasting Company. 'I pray,' she writes, 'to preserve my husband's life' (p. 258).<br /><br />Jains, the book informs us, 'follow a religion that's often described as an extreme form of Buddhism' (p. 281) and 'don't really believe in a controlling creator that judges and directs retribution' (p. 283). Sarah is unable to accept the 'self-violence' of the seemingly progressive 'Jain ritual of santhara - starving oneself to death when all purposes in life have been served, or the body is useless' (p. 285).<br /><br />To the author, India, the land of her 'rebirth' (p. 289), is both 'the best of humanity' and 'the worst of humanity' (p. 67). 'India is beyond statement, for anything you say, the opposite is also true' (p. 107).<br /><br />In the end, India is unable to inspire Sarah to 'worship' (p. 106) much more than the air-conditioner. Varanasi, or Benares, she says, is the experience that 'has branded itself on me most boldly' (p. 290).<br /><br />India's secret for happiness, in the words of one of the author's interlocutors, 'We Indian people, we look at the people more poor, more low, more hard than us and we be thanking God we are not them. So we are happy' (p. 111).<br /><br />Sarah is still an atheist but feels that 'being an extreme atheist is as arrogant as being an extreme fundamentalist' (p. 121). She tells people, 'I'm a Christian by culture but have no God' (p. 129). She is incapable of surrendering to a guru because, she says, 'the Westerner in me is automatically suspicious of people who claim to be perfect' (p. 141).<br /><br />She writes, 'all religions, even the most inclusive of all, are ultimately perverted by humankind' (p. 286). But she neglects to acknowledge that all religions are the creation of humankind in the first place. 'I don't want to reject religion as the cause of human hatred,' she says (p. 287). Sarah's 'feelings on arranged marriages have changed' because 'lust doesn't last and couples with things in common do' (p. 219). In India, she's begun to see religion differently because 'it gives people with so little so much' (p. 244).<br /><br />She leaves us with the words of Jiddu Krishnamurti, 'When one loses the deep intimate relationship with nature then temples, mosques and churches become important' (p. 288).<br />The Parsis, or Zoroastrians, are the 'most Western of India's ethnic groups' (p. 179) who 'became rich because they were firm friends with the British [who] gave them huge chunks of Bombay' (p. 181).  <br /> <br />The vulture they depend on 'to take them to heaven' is on the 'critically endangered' list (p. 179).

Regardless, I'd highly recommend this book for those trying to improve the rigor of their strategic thinking for hospitals, medical groups, schools of medicine, and health systems.	2005-10-11

Because of Leo Carey's wry, admiring, melancholy essay in THE NEW YORKER, I grabbed this novel and its two prequels when I found them at a local used bookstore, and oh, how I wanted to like them more than I ended up doing. But they're just not as good as the hype. They drift all over the place [to be fair, Carey admitted that devotees of mysteries would find these books too undisciplined], and the narrator's aggressively amoral personality -- imagine P. G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster crossed with Jonathan Gash's Lovejoy -- can wear on one after a while. The plots are made of Swiss cheese, at best, and these books are also sadly dated in their views of women. Maybe it's because I read the Lovejoy books before these -- if I had come to them without knowing about Lovejoy, I would have enjoyed them more.	2005-10-11

JSF is more bold in his use of a not-quite linear narrative that is disrupted by somteimes sublime, somteimes irritating, observations of his protagonist, Oskar, and the liberal use of \\"found\\" photos and mostly blank pages.  Do not pick this up expecting the sort of story you read in his first book - one that is funny and sweeps the reader smoothly into well-earned sentiment - but the same pattern is here.  Essentially, that beneath these quirky and highly-engaging oddball characters is a deep pool of human emotion in which we all find resonance.<br />While his first novel can reasonably count \\"Two wild and crazy guys\\" as influences, ELAIC shows a more subdued and well-crafted heritage - most notably Auster's New York Trilogy.  One could even say it's downright Derridean, but that's too pretentious for even me.<br />This one is not as fun to read as EIL - you won't find yourself forcing friends to read passages of it in their best Ukranian accent - but it is certainly well worth the reading.	2005-10-11

I think we all tend to get into a rut with a workouts and need a fresh perspective to motivate us again.  I got seriously into Body for Life by Bill Phillips and completed three 12 week sessions. I was truely in the  best shape of my life, but then it got stale and I needed help with a bad back.  Every expert recommends \\"core strengthening\\" to improve back pain, so this program was a natural fit.  It starts with a great stretching routine.  It then incorporates an exercise ball routine, pilates, plyometrics, and weight training.  The conclusion is a massage and stretching routine.  Verstegen has created a complex program which is not for beginners (try Body for Life first).  His workout routine work sheets are hard to follow.  I did think the exercises can be learned from the pictures shown without the CD-ROM. <br /> <br />Pros:  <br /> 1. Fun intense workout program with a fresh outlook <br /> 2. Good way to learn Pilates and core strengthening if you hate Denise Austin <br /> 3. Definitely will strengthen weaknesses you didn't know you had <br /> 4. It gives this white boy hope he can run fast and jump high again and get buff in the process <br /> <br />Cons: <br /> 1. A lot to learn for a newbie <br /> 2. Lots of exercise equipment you might not own (foam roll, exercise ball, resistance bands, hurdles, step, yoga strap, pull up bar, more if you really get into it) <br /> 3. May take more time to learn the exercises and workout than you have <br /> 4. Strange terminology and abbreviations create confusion (e.g. cardio is called ESD, energy system development, stretching is AIS, active-isolated stretching, and more)  I don't know what personal issues made Verstegen rename normal stuff, but it becomes intimidating and weird.    <br /> <br />Good luck. Despite the cons I do think it's a well developed program. I hope you enjoy the program like I do.   <br />	2005-10-11

For example, he claims that the Method is not practical because you cannot \\"force\\" your emotions (those who have read any of Stanislavski's books will recognize that Stanislavski said this exact thing) and you cannot force yourself to believe something you know to be false (if Mamet had read Stanislavski's sections on the \\"magic if,\\" he would find that Stanislavski also teaches this and has a solution to the problem).    The fact that he calls the Stanislavski System the Stanislavski Method makes me suspect that he is actually thinking of Strasberg's Method, who is often accused of putting too much emphasis on the certain aspects of a System like internal embodiment of the role and many say misunderstood large parts of the Stanislavski system; after Stella Adler studied with Stanislavski and returned to the Group Theatre, she and several other teachers of the 'Method' broke with Strasberg on these issues (including Meisner, who Mamet later studied under, who very strongly disagrees with Strasberg's methods and teaching style and says so very frankly in his book \\"Sanford Meisner on Acting\\"). Many of the issues Mamet brings up are fairly common criticisms of Strasberg, especially by Meisner.    When he quits ranting against the Stanislavski System and what he thinks actors need to stop doing and gets down to what he thinks actors SHOULD do, many of his principals are (or, at least, should be) either painfully obvious (such as, our job as actors is to entertain the audience) or of little use to serious actors. For example, he spends a whole chapter writing on auditions - only problem is he gives no advice on how to audition well or successfully, he just explains why they are a bad way of casting (without, I might note, recommending a better way of casting - everyone involved hates auditions, we only do them because no-one has come up with a better system, unless the production team is casting a star or someone whose work they are familiar with enough to skip the audition). Stanislavski (whose approach was \\"these are the principals of what must happen \\"internally,\\" this is how it looks externally, this is how it looks when you're creating a character for the stage), Mamet does not spend much time explaining how his principals work or how they are to be applied on stage, which tends to limit the usefulness of the good principals he has.    I will give Mamet credit for a few things, though. His writing is concise and to the point, and touches on a few of the basic principals of acting, and he points out a few mistakes that some actors make. The one thing that this book does a very good job with is reminding us of the basic job of the actor, which actors tend to get away from sometimes, such as the fact that the audience is paying good money to see us perform and our first obligation is to them (although even this can be dangerous in that it can cause you to play what you think the audience should be seeing rather than playing the scene honestly, which can lead to unrealistic and dishonest acting). He makes a few other interesting points (e.g., the primary place we learn to act is on stage, not in the classroom, and the tendency to stay in school forever rather than get practical experience in the theatre won't help you but is rather damaging to your acting).    Do not read this book instead of other acting books, but rather in addition to them. The book is fairly short - you should be able to read it quickly. This would be good to read along with Stanislavski or books on the Method, but don't read it as a the first or only acting book you read. I would NOT recommend buying it, although I would recommend reading it once and only once as an alternative perspective on acting - more perspectives is a good thing, and even if I disagree with much of that perspective it makes you think about why you disagree with it which is a good thing.	2005-10-11

I didn't find this amazing, but yet from the first page of the preface, Dr. Savage's words, definitions, vocabulary, and explanation of his concepts are even more prescient than I thought then--and thoroughly applicable today.<br /><br />Like Savage, I'm a trained scientist. However, I wouldn't venture into political theory in the way he has so successfully. Yet, I'm fully qualified to speak about the effects of borders, language, and culture on a society and nation as he is--and have studied history as much as he has (even reading Paris in the Revolution and being thoroughly familiar with the revolutions of 1848, and the decline of several empires).  America never aspired to empire, although I wonder if we would be worse off for doing so.  Taft was such a benevolent administrator of the Philippines after the Spanish-American War, so artfully engineered by Theodore Roosevelt, that I wonder if some 3rd world nations wouldn't have benefitted from the export of some Americanism just as India benefitted from the imposition of the British educational system, which we still see today (oh, those H1B Visas!).<br /><br />Dr. Savage saw the societal decline that would be brought on by lying fake news and so-called liberalism (SJW-wealth and demoralization redistribution downward--or is that upward????....I would be horrified to find that I committed such an error as to mistake up for down, east for west, and that my fine education was a waste.....). Fear not, I did not nor will my progeny end up at Evergreen State University.  Though I could have claimed Hispanic origin, I lived and was brought up in a meritocracy, so don't come crying when I tell you that liberalism, snuck in when I was watching the Vietnam War with Walter Cronkite at dinner (barf), by the demoncats of the 1960s to re-establish the plantation, that I've mistaken Savage's message....the peril he well explained in his radio and book career, but as he said, he's done enough.  America will remain or fall on the vision of its founders, plain and simple. And I don't think they could have imagined how the technocrats would subjugate event he intelligentsia within 300 years (mass genocide not being necessary).  Try telling a friend (SJ if you have one) that you're reading the Federalist Papers or Thomas Jefferson.  Hamilton has only been rehabilitated because of the mass disrespect given VP Pence at a performance on Broadway. Otherwise, I doubt many people today would know who he was, or what his principles were.<br /><br />To the Savages and Savagettes, Dittoheads and Levinites, I think you must read this book again--if you really understood it on round 1.<br /><br />You have to give Dr. Michael (Weiner) Savage his due.  He is one of the great thinkers of our time, successful as a scientist and successful as a political philosopher.  The title is provocative, and &#34;liberalism&#34; isn't slated to join the nomenclature of Mental Disorders formally recognized.  However, the &#34;treatment&#34; is not medical--it is political.<br /><br />This book communicates ideas that some readers will be well familiar with from his syndicated 3-hour radio show on KNEW....rather than simply complain about the state of America today, he offers concrete and do-able solutions in plain English--the language of America.<br /><br />I wouldn't look for a foreign translation too soon.  Dr. Savage's main themes, that our nation is based in and has survived due to maintainence of our borders, language, and unique culture--SHOULD BE WELL KNOWN to all citizens and wanna-be citizens.<br /><br />I don't think it is quoted in this book, but one American visiouanry, Theodore Roosevelt, once said that what America needs are NOT hyphenated Americans.  Do you know anyone who came to this country wanting to KEEP the oppressive identity and culture he left behind?  By the way, &#34;he&#34; is a linguistic convention, not anti-feminism.<br /><br />Savage shows great intellectual clarity--exposing the problems of liberal thinking and multiculturalism, and dare one add &#34;diversity&#34; to the destruction of American culture.  We are on the precipice of our survival--and we had best listen.Savage shows great intellectual clarity--exposing the problems of liberal thinking and multiculturalism, and dare one add &#34;diversity&#34; to the destruction of American culture.

In relating the story of Michael Straight, the spy of the title, he portrays a spoiled rich young whippersnapper. Unlike his Cambridge colleagues who devoted their lives to Soviet espionage out of ideological conviction, Michael Straight seems to have bought his way into the KGB with generous capitalist donations. Indeed, Straight comes across as such a dilettante that one wonders what value he could have possibly had for that organization other than his money. Philby, it will be recalled, worked diligently in SIS; Burgess divided his efforts between the BBC and the Foreign Office, for which Maclean also toiled; Blunt was in MI5 during the war, and Cairncross worked for GC&CS and the Treasury. In other words, all of them had access to important information. Straight, according to Perry, flitted in and out of the State Department with such frequent rapidity that his access to information of interest seems at best to be ephemeral. Perhaps FDR, who ignored Straight's initial overtures for a position in government, had an insight to his character, which borders on the shallow to say the least.<br /><br />I do not doubt that Straight was indeed a Soviet agent, but Perry, whose citations are a bit thin, is short on detail of what he actually accomplished for the Soviet Union. As a publisher of a patently ultra-liberal magazine, Straight did not even have a plausible cover, as the \\"real\\" Cambridge spies did. His cover story of researching a novel in the wilds of Colorado where the Government just happened to be building a secret installation makes Guy Burgess's hare-brained schemes (such as sending hot-air balloons over the grain fields in Hungary in hopes that they would catch fire) sound positively brilliant. Was the FBI of the McCarthy era really so thick that they didn't catch on to Straight before he \\"confessed?\\" For that matter, why confess at all?!<br /><br />Whitney Straight, an agent of SIS, according to Perry, suspected his brother Michael in 1950, one year before Burgess and Maclean defected, an event that brought down Philby and the rest of the Cambridge ring. Perry, however, does not comment on this phenomenon. If true, it might indicate that SIS did indeed suspect Philby and his Cambridge friends by association, and subsequently set a trap for them (as Hamrick suggests in \\"Deceiving the Deceivers.\\"). The author, however, sees nothing unusual in the chronology of the elder brother's suspicions.<br /><br />Mr. Perry often compels his readers to undertake a leap of faith during the course of the narrative. For instance, his account of Straight's career in espionage is based on an assumption that Victor Rothschild and his wife Tess were also Soviet agents. The plausibility of such a hypothesis is founded upon their close friendship with Anthony Blunt from Cambridge days. Without any concrete documentation, however, the author seems to be pronouncing them guilty by association (rather McCarthyish!). Unlike Straight, who couldn't wait to spill the beans on both Blunt and Burgess, the Rothschilds did indeed remain friends with Anthony Blunt, even after he was publicly disgraced. Their loyalty to an old friend in adversity, however, seems commendable under the circumstances.<br /><br />The Cambridge spies are said to have valued E.M.

When my package arrived, I opened it up to find this was not all I had hoped it would be.   <br /> <br />The Bad: <br /> <br />The cover is actually the best part of the book, with many of the pictures inside being very grainy, and not very well-composed for a Black-and-White.  In my opinion, a study of the female nude in outdoor (natural) settings in itself should be done in color IF your focus is going to be the SETTING more so than the NUDE.  Take pages 16,20,24,33,35,37,48,52,53,64,67,68,95,96, and 99 (I'll try to post some of these so you can see them).  Many of these don't even include a female in the shot (and of the ones that do, there are only 2 pictures where you can see the woman's face, which makes you focus on the landscape in most of them) - and the landscape really loses quite a bit of its flavor without color.  For a travel marketing photographer, Manolis Tsantakis should have known this.  You can see in some of these pictures that the landscape is beautiful, but it does not entice you all that much in b&w.  Not to say it can't work - the shot on page 100 works perfectly in b&w, and actually sends a chill up my spine at how eerie a still lake can be. <br /> <br />The Good: <br /> <br />There are some great pictures that do work very well - most notably the ones on pages 9,11-13,19,29,39,43,49,56-59,60,69,71,72,76-79,81-85,88,89,93,100,101,104,105.

The factual summaries of its calico patchwork of case studies and speculations on art and language are, I suppose, interesting enough as a type of extended news report on what at least a few neuroscientists in San Diego have been thinking about, what kinds of patients they have seen, and what experiments they have conducted to support certain explanations. <br /> <br />If you are looking for something brilliant, insightful, well-wrought -- something that fulfills the spirit of its own promise of making neuroscience more accessible to \\"workingmen\\" -- this is not it. I can't imagine it inspiring many high school students to become neuroscientists, for example. I will trust that in real life, V.S.R's pen betrays his true honesty, humanity, and sensitivity. <br /> <br />I find it difficult to overlook the senselessness and banality of various sarcastic quips sprinkled throughout the book, and the odd cavalcade of provincialism, pretentiousness and superbity that bears the tone of a speaker whose social consciousness is far too rooted in the 19th century. Yeah, I know, these were originally lectures, delivered by a man of Indian heritage in Britain. But it remains as though it is the only mode in which he knows how to be \\"literary.\\"  <br /> <br />V.S.R. even goes so far as to commit the ultimate act of self-conceit by quoting himself regarding his disdain for whatever he might consider philosophy. It is interesting how the logic of the quotation works. In the epigram beneath chapter title, \\"Neuroscience - The New Philosophy,\\" V.S.R. quotes himself as saying, \\"All of philosophy consists of unlocking, exhuming, and recanting what's been said before, and then getting riled up about it.\\" So, let me see if I've got this straight: If all of philosophy is just that, then what we have here is hardly a encouraging advertisement for neuroscience. At that level, I suppose the same might be said for all things from geology to biology. It's all about digging up what's always been there and getting riled up. <br /> <br />It is exactly this kind of misstep that makes this book, as a book, as a tract of prose, and a supposedly outreaching introduction to the field, not of the best of its possibilities. V.S.R. may indeed be one of our most gifted physicians. And I would certainly wish him well. And for all his disdain of Freud, I certainly won't be the one to let him in on the secret that his favored method for studying neurological syndromes and anomalies for insights into normal functioning is, in fact, exactly the same general strategy as Freud's!  <br /> <br />Someone might mention, though, that Noam Chomsky didn't invent linguistics, but that C.S. Peirce is probably more rightfully the owner of the title. Peirce was more of a \\"real\\" scientist, head of the Geological Survey, a mentor and later detractor of William James--especially his psychology--,and a true 19th century character, all of which V.S.R. would no doubt consider plusses. <br />	2005-10-11

His work is often political but he doesn't beat you over the head with his message. Keith's style is to show interesting events that have occurred that aren't necessarily all that unusual until you stop to think about what actually happened; kind of like a black Seinfeld in a way. A lot of his material is about his family, living in San Francisco and about his work as a cartoonist and his band. \\"The Passion of the Keef' follows events in his life as he progresses into later adulthood; being married, going bald, being recognized on the streets and the beginning of fame.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed \\"The Passion of the Keef\\" and most of Keith's work because of his unique interpretation of life. For instance, when I usually hear about life in San Francisco most of it is about the food, gay parades or corny TV cop shows. The city is so much more than that. Keith's book actually gave me a small feel of what daily life might be like there, just a peek.  <br /> <br />I am sure a few people have compared this to the \\"boondocks\\". I think they're apples and oranges but I can see a connection. They both make political statements but \\"The Passion of the Keef\\" is much broader in scope and not nearly as edgy, edgy meaning being potentially offensive to some or many but not better or worse. Keith's characters do less editorializing than the Boondocks they look at a situation and they're like \\"hey, this is messed up\\". While Boondocks characters say the same thing and start naming names and specific events. Each has its own place and both are great interpretations of often the same events. <br /> <br />The book itself is small; you could finish it in a day. The artwork is minimal but does a good job to convey the emotions of the characters and the situation they're in. It's more than worth the price; I just wish that he would come out with work more frequently.  <br />	2005-10-11

Olivia Calwell is newly married to the devastatingly handsome, somewhat secretive, and incredibly dashing Dane Calwell, Lord Greenleigh.  She finds great pleasure in his company, in the bedroom and out. Unfortunately he is a very busy man during the day.  He is usually away at meetings or locked in his study with his business advisor.<br /><br />Although she is falling helplessly in love with Dane, Olivia is very frustrated by her new husband's cryptic behavior.<br /><br />Dane Calwell, Lord Greenleigh, is a member of the Royal Four, men charged with protecting England and the Prince Regent in complete secrecy. Known as the Lion, Dane knows that his service to England is his foremost duty.  But the new Lady Greenleigh, Olivia, tempts him from his mission in ways he never expected.  Olivia is poised, intelligent and has a marvelous sense of humor.  While Dane appreciates Olivia's cleverness, he also laments this very trait for she is constantly questioning things.  If he isn't careful, her curiosity and intellect will interfere with his latest mission, putting Olivia in terrible danger. Can the Lion protect his country and his heart?<br /><br />I love these characters and I love their story. Olivia is sweetly awkward and delightfully funny. I especially love her fearless interaction with Dane, although, there were times I wanted to shake him senseless and wished Olivia would do it for me. But I forgave him, how could I not? For Dane is dutiful, noble, and oh, so sinfully gorgeous. Dane has me so enthralled that I am still drooling over him.<br /><br />Surrender to a Wicked Spy is a keeper! I knew I'd love this book when I giggled out loud in the very first chapter. Ms. Bradley's sense of humor always shines in her writing, but especially so in Surrender to a Wicked Spy. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of romance, intrigue and hot, delicious sex. And I cannot stress enough how delicious it is!

Compared to other Rock N Roll biograpgies, this is a REAL behind the scenes look at KISS. It does have a few parts that even a KISS fan might skip over just because they are kind of boring but most of the facts are stuff you really should know. I like Gene's writing. Another thing I thought was that a casual listener of KISS who only knew a couple hits wouldn't like this much and would drift in and out. So you have to know some things about the band in order for this to be good reading.	2005-10-11

Besides the architectural discussions (interesting but not germane to this bibliography), there's a great deal on how public buildings established the image of monarchy, whether autocratic or democratic, in the public mind. Fontainebleau, Versailles, Windsor Castle, Charlottenburg, Hampton Court, the Russian Winter Palace, Sch&ouml;nbrunn, Neuschwanstein, and the \\"pink palace\\" in Monte Carlo all have very different messages to impart. The author, who spent a decade on the editorial staff of Burke's, also is very knowledgeable about the dynastic trials and tribulations, successes and bragging rights that produced these showplaces, as well as the failures that led to many of them being converted to state-owned museums.	2005-10-11

I read this book because I was hoping it would shed light on a problem which seems to be a product of modern American society.  <br /> The First half of this book is very interesting. Ted creates a hypothetical psychological model of a killer and in the third person describes how this person developed from a regular guy with deep emotion issues into a full fledged mass murder. That part of the book is very frightening and thought provoking. Ted describes the killer's initial fascination with alcohol and violent pornography. From there he describes the slow progress of the killer instict: how his trips to the pornographic book stores became more frequent and urgent, how he spent a year spying in women's house before almost attacking a woman one night, followed months later by an actual attack, then a rape and killing.He also describes the killer's remorse between killings and his frequent  promises that this would be the last one.  <br /> Toward the middle of the book it gets pretty boring. The second interviewer takes over and keeps trying to get Ted to admit his guilt, which he won't do. Most of the answers in this half of the book are evasive and tiringly repetitive.  <br />  It is redeemed in the last interview in which Ted makes some rather interesting statements about how it is our society which creates the serial killer. He also talks about how this a problem   which manifests itself rather early in the life of these sick men,and what's even more frightening, he states that for every man arrested for multiple homicide there are five or six more that are not caught. With a little money, Ted states, a man can kill indiscriminately for the rest of his life without fear of detection. This book is  a must read for anyone interested in Abnormal Psychology.	2005-10-11

This is not so much a book of particular things to do as it is a change of point of view, according to author Richard Wincor.  Wincor is a self-described 'average player', although it is obvious that he is better than that (however, Wincor's name is absent from the major lists of players, so while he may be above average, he did attain the master level ranking).<br /><br />This is not in fact a book for beginners, or perhaps even average players.  It involves strategy and tactics that Wincor describes with little definition to the terminology he uses.  This can be confusing to the novice who is unfamiliar with chess writing, so this is perhaps a good second or third book, but not a good first.  Besides, perhaps one should learn the game along the more traditional lines before one goes for broke through the baroque.<br /><br />Wincor's style of writing is fun and interesting to read.  He would identify with the second section in Edward Lasker's book, 'Chess for Fun and Chess for Blood'.  However, for Wincor, obviously the 'blood' is fun!  He writes of the first opening he describes, 'The most aggressive Baroque opening for White is the Dutch Stonewall.  Its texture is solid, massive and pent-up, something like a bunching of heavy tanks.  When it rolls, it has a chance of flattening all opposition in the King's fortress.'<br /><br />Wincor's commentary is inspired.  For example, in the same Dutch Stonewall game, he makes a comment after one interesting turn of play, 'Mrs. Bruce played that domestic tragedy like an Amazon.'  Wincor, upon speculating on the question of whether or not there is such a thing as a perfect opening, draws in ideas from Neoplatonists and quotes the poet Pope (yet hastens to add that Pope never thought of chess as an application of his verse).<br /><br />Wincor does not promise in this book that the novice will begin winning in grand-master tournaments.  However, he states, 'Still they lose, but with more style than before.'<br /><br />This is a very fun book.).   <br /> <br />Wincor does not promise in this book that the novice will begin winning in grand-master tournaments.

Ho Che Anderson, Scream Queen (Fantagraphics, 2005)<br /><br />Ho Che Anderson takes the Brute method of drawing (if you don't know Brute's work, look at some KMFDM album covers) to whole new areas of weirdness. It's a kind of German expressionism mixed with pulp-fiction-book-cover thing they've got going on. Not too easy on the eyes, but then the subject matter usually demands some pain.<br /><br />Kind of hard to explain the plot of this one without getting into spoilers from the very beginning. There's this woman, you see, hitch-hiking...<br /><br />Very odd stuff. Requires some thought at the end to see what Anderson's on about (not with the plot, which resolves nicely, but the reason for the existence of the thing in the first place), and you're likely to draw only the most ambiguous of conclusions. Feels like a short story that's begging to become a novel; will we see a full-length Scream Queen from Anderson in the future? One can only hope. ***	2005-10-11

Perloff's Shadows of Power is a fact based account of the real power behind the American political system. The CFR (Council on Foriegn Relations), an invitation only organization, is the North American sister organization of the RIIA (Royal Institute of International Affairs). The CFR, with David C. Rockefeller as it's Honorary Chairman, permeates the highest levels of government (Current members include Dick Cheney, Condaleeza Rice, Teddy Kennedy, Bill Frist, Colin Powell, Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, Henry Kissinger, John McCain, John Kerry and the list goes on and on). Media organizations and their highest ups like Rupert Murdoch, Catherine Graham (Washington Post) and all of his media empire (Fox News etc.) as well as reporters like Barbara Walters etc. are also members. And as Perloff makes clear, the organizations goal is to create a one world elitist government. <br /> <br />Once you read and digest the facts that Perloff presents in an orderly fashion, it becomes clear that we are being led down a primrose path by a group of insiders connected to the international banking community and very high level power brokers who keep a low profile and operate in the shadows (Hence, shadows of power.). <br /> <br />This book is not about Conspiracy Theory. It is about Conspiracy facts. If you want to peek behind the curtain of power or can't make sense of the moves of our politicians, this book will begin to clear the haze of confusion for you. <br />  <br />I would also recommend a companion book by John McManus- The Insiders which provides a current list of CFR members. Good overview of the CFR and Tri Lateral Commission that takes you through each Presidency since Carter and traces the CFR members and their moves. It also provides a list of current members which serves as a nice reference while watching TV, etc. Once you understand the motives of this organization, it allows you to see through the hidden messages being conveyed by the media and through current legislation. <br /> <br />I would also suggest 2 books that will significantly clarify the power of economic control and how it is being used to control our lives. One is Edward G. Griffins- The Creature from Jekyll Island which is about the orgin and operations of the Federal Reserve System. (Not Federal, has no reserves and is a cartel of private banks not a system.) Reading this book is like taking the blue pill instead of the red one as was offered to Neo in the first matrix movie. You will never again look at our government in the same way. Again based upon well documented fact, not theory. <br /> <br />The second book is again from John McManus entitled Financial Terrorism and it is also a fact based book on money and economics that is a clearly written yet easily understood (as is Griffins book) expose of how our money system has been corrupted into the hands of internation bankers and power brokers. <br /> <br />There are more, but if you read these 4 books you will be light years ahead of most private citizens in their understanding of what is really going on in out lives and reality and less easily led down a primrose path by the power elites. <br /> <br />Finally, for a sample dose of reality go to [...] and read the article Abolishing the USA, follow the links to the government site on the SPP (Security and Prosperity Partnership for America) and keep an open mind. See for yourself that this stuff is happening before our very eyes while we are asleep at the wheel naively allowing our liberties and prosperity to be stolen away by a ruthless group of power elites who only goal is total dominance, power and control over all of humanity. <br /> <br />Please read the books, reflect and help out before our way of life disappears forever and is replaced by a 1984-like reality.  <br />	2005-10-11

In one of his theories he contends that early American literature was negatively affected by the duality of idealism and materialism. He wrote three biographies of major writers to illustrate this theory, one on Henry James, who, Brooks believed, fled to Europe rather than face the problem; another on Mark Twain, his most controversial book, in which he attempted to show how Twain was a failure, unable to fulfill his potential because of his \\"crippling\\" Calvinistic background; and the third on Emerson, whom he thought a success.<br /><br />All this was prelude, however, to his major work, a multi-volume series of critical books, spanning the time from Washington Irving up to about 1915. Nelson relates that Brooks, before starting, had decided to read EVERYTHING written in the 19th Century, and one gets the feeling from these works is of a man filled with authority and confidence in his judgments. Nelson's biography covers the important points in Brooks's life, though it's somewhat shallow and doesn't delve much beneath the surface. His writing style is pedestrian. Brooks, unfortunately, has fallen from favor and has pretty much disappeared from the literary scene, even in the historical sense. Hopefully his work will not be totally forgotten.	2005-10-11

It isn't that he has his students playing \\"paintball\\" warfare with aluminum foil swords and shields on the campus lawn--it's more that he was and is trying to make the feeling and reality of warfare more tangible and understandable for those of us who study or are interested in ancient war. His descriptions of battle make your skin tingle, just like you might feel when watching a battle scene in a movie. He is just adept at doing the same with words and without the fancy feathered costumes.

As I have developed my exegesis process, this book, and it's companion, Biblical Greek (by Zerwick) have helped me expand my understanding of Greek.  The little lesson codes in the Grammatical Analysis lead you to more training in Greek.  For example, prepositional phrases may have a variety of nuances depending on the shade of meaning that the preposition implies in the context.  Zerwick labels these nuances and gives relevant lesson codes tied right into the text.  So for a typical passage I'm working on for a sermon, I can often have 4-7 five or ten minute Biblical Greek lessons at my finger tips. That is very cool. Sometimes they are just technical jazz that wastes time....but other times it helps me retranslate the passage or phrase!  I always try to check those little lessons...in fact I have gotten into the habit of highlighting them for the passage I'm working on and zooming in on them while waiting for something somewhere.<br /><br />The criticisms of this book (don't believe the reviews that say it's fabulous...it has it's flaws too).  Sometimes I've seen a catholic bias in the text (it is from Rome you know)....or have been unable to find scholars online who really know what he's referring to...he can be difficult to understand...but that is rare-maybe a couple times per year for me. The more substantive criticism really is that he gives so little information and uses so many abbreviations that you have to be on your toes to know exactly what he means or look up a lot of stuff.  Once you start using it all the time, then these problems go away...because your knowledge level should rise.<br /><br />If you really don't remember your first year greek at all...this book is probably too tough for you.  If you remember some of your first year Greek, it may help you start moving forward in your exegesis.  It sure is practically laid out...organized like the NT starting with Matthew 1:1.  I use BibleWorks 6.0 for my exegesis and have Zerwick with me in my book bag where-ever I go right next to my laptop.<br /><br />For the exegesis process, NT Exegesis by Gordon Fee is the best book I've found.  I use his sermon exegesis process.  He recommends Zerwick as the best Grammatical Analysis tool for quickly identifying exegetical difficulties in a text when doing either full exegesis or sermon exegesis.  His analysis is that Zerwick is the most complete and helpful analysis of the NT for the exegesis process!  I completely agree.out...organized like the NT starting with Matthew 1:1.

Then, contrary to everything you learned about physiology, as he dies he aligns himself in the pose of one of Leonardo da Vinci's best-known images. Accompanied by invisible written messages. That a person with a bullet in his guts would find these tasks impossible is irrelevant. This is a conspiracy thriller and you must set reason aside. Saunieres' posture, various leavings around the Louvre, including the messages, and the fact that he has a granddaughter named Sophie [\\"wisdom\\" in the event you've forgotten your Antiquities 101 course] are all part of A Grand Scheme. Or Schema. Or something. Whatever it is, Brown gathers some obscure mythology, some devious plotting, some innocents abroad and weaves them all into a fast-paced, exciting story of plausible scenarios. Pick it up and it will remain open until you close the final page.<br /><br />American Robert Langdon, an antiquarian from Harvard, is brought in to explain the messages [nobody bothers to explain about the physiology]. Then, to keep the plot moving, Langdon's charged with Saunieres' murder. The real murderer, however, is more than just elusive. He's a monk. An albino, a feature which should make him glare like a torch to observers. Silas the Silent gets about like a wraith, fed the information he needs to accomplish his tasks by the Teacher. The Teacher is an obscure figure, communicating only when he wishes and remaining well apart from the activity. Is the Teacher a key figure in this tale? Is the Teacher THE key figure in this imaginitive story? You betchum! But his identity remains securely stowed away until the final chapters.<br /><br />Any story starting in Paris is bound to lead elsewhere with most authors, but not this one. Even with plots and conspiracies involving the Vatican and antiquities' scholarship, this account takes two sidesteps to Castle Gandolfo and one to near London. We aren't allowed in to any of the Italian museums. We learn something about the title's namesake, but only what is needed for the conspiracy to unfold. We never even make it to Harvard. However, in a bizarre jaunt, Brown conveys us to Scotland! What on earth is pertinent to Leonardo da Vinci in a remote town in auld Caledonia? The Grail! So, instead of Indiana Jones grubbing in the deserts of Arabia for the Grail, we have a Harvard academic and a goddess of Wisdom poking about in the stones near Scone in the age-old quest. It's good Grail fare. These days you can plunk the Grail down anywhere on the planet and make a story of it. And Brown has done just that. It's a good read and raises some interesting questions.

After going through about 3-4 different types of CG courses and experimenting with my own seminars I find that this book is just way too wide of a scope.  It seems like it tries to cram general computer graphics, interactive computer graphics, and advanced computer graphics in one... and do a bad job at it.  Looking through the book I seriously doubt that some topics can be covered in one chapter, especially some of the viewing chapters.  How can you cover all aspect of 2D and 3D viewing, even in breadth only and no depth, in one chapter?  That's just ridiculous.  It almost feels as if they are saying that you need a separate major for CG completely, one course for overview, one for 2d, one for 3d, one for interactive graphics, and a few for advanced topics in computer graphics... but the problem is that that is too narrow of a scope for any 4 year college degree.  Plus you can't even start some of the basic discussions without general education in the fundamental math like linear algebra, calculus, discrete math, and so forth.  So this book is sort of making a statement that can't be backed in the real world.  Though this does offer a good overview for people who are just curious.  It touches on a wide variety of things and has very practical approach to having a workable project using openGL.<br /><br />Now as for Davis's comments on a good book.  I think Foley and van Dam has actually a pretty good book for undergrads, especially when you set appropriate prequisits for the course.  Keeping in mind that CG should be a junior-senior level undergrad course.  I studied CG1 when I was an art major and found the Foley van Dam book to usable, though dry, but usable.  I found other books later on to be useful, but they are a bit specialized.  A few good ones I must suggest for graphics math is essential mathematics for games by van verth and bishop to be good.  I also recommend realtime graphics by akenine-moller and haine for interactive graphics.  For some specialized ones you have to look around but I do recommend my professor's (david breen) book on cloth animation.  But yeah, to sum it up, stick with Foley van Dam for your intro courses... maybe use this as an added supplement, especially when considering OpenGL for your teaching tool.	2005-10-11

The big downside to these volumes is that they eventually split in half! However... I also own a stack of other film encyclopedias but for weight and manageability this is the best of the lot. The book is around 2 inches thick - but is the size of a novel and you can hold it in one hand. It is a full resource (with over 18,000 titles!), easy to carry around and has a full listing of directors and cast at the back along with Oscar winners. Overall the reviews are not very good and they are limited to just four of five lines at best. I mostly do not use it for the reviews though. It is more of a \\"find a director or star that you like and quickly flick through the index and the corresponding works to see what else they have done\\". For that it is very impressive but if you are looking for in-depth reviews then you should go elsewhere for the more unmanageable volumes and Arnold Schwarzenner to help carry them around for you.	2005-10-11

His accounts of experiences in Iraq are probably mostly factual, but mostly boring.   <br /> <br />Let me just put this in perspective, almost 20 years after reading Dispatches for the first time, I still recall the power of the words in that book.  Two days after reading The Last True Story and I'm trying to remember something memorable about it. <br />	2005-10-11
US	50991929	R1JH7E9RL43EBS	0525948783	444785726	Genevieve	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Disappointing...	The story that Dickey is trying to tell has so much promise but gets lost in the purely gratuitous sexuality.  Every time the plot gets interesting there is another poorly written porn-like description of an almost disgusting sexual scene.  I have read several of Mr. Dickey's books and it dawned on me after reading this one that they are all the same.  The story becomes less important than the sex scenes because Mr. Dickey is so repetitive in his depiction of sexuality in his novels.  No matter which book you pick up the sex scenes read the same!  It is amazing to me that Dickey is regarded as someone who does justice to writing about women when he clearly can only write from a man's point of view.  That becomes even more clear when reading his depictions of sexuality in his novels.  This story, Genevieve's story, could have been told so much better than the way it was.  It is my opinion that the sexuality of Mr. Dickey's novels has become the central theme to his writing.  The plot and complexity of his characters appear to be mere accessories to the graphic sexual encounters he spends the bulk of his imaginitive writing on.  I am disappointed because I love a good story about black people and the complicated way that our history can play out in our lives and this story was abandoned for sex acts that have all been done before. Mr. Dickey why are all of your characters in every story you tell so driven by sex?  I would expect this from Zane and now I can expect it from you.	2005-10-11

Very few books will touch your heart and make you think about the unselfishness and the overwhelming goodness contributed to our world by dogs.

Her father was a doctor who had been raised in poverty; her mother a university educated teacher from a wealthy family.  They dressed in European styles and could have enjoyed a wonderful, privileged, peaceful life were it not for the place they were born and the times they lived in.  Nelofer's story of growing up in Afghanistan is riveting.  Time and again, I would re-read a paragraph absolutely astonished that this beautiful woman lived this life and suffered through these horrors and yet can tell this story with beauty and clarity and grace.  She tells of visiting her father in prison at a young age, a scene that strengthened her resolve and planted a seed of strength in this young girl.  I was moved learning from her what it was like living in a country divided by war and terror during the Russian invasion.  Her attempts to fight the Communists by joining revolutionary resistant groups and the story of her family's eventual escape to Canada via Pakistan are gripping.  Her eye for detail and her incredible grasp of the conflicting power struggles of Communism, the Taliban, the U.S., and the succession of various leaders of the country show a depth of intelligence and courage few can aspire to.  Nelofer is a woman of substance who we can learn much from, and I think we will hear more from her in the future.  The parallel threads that she weaves, or that I read into this story of life in a country at war and the hatred felt by the people in that country for the invaders sent chills down my spine since there are Nelofers right now within Iraq - living a life much like hers yet in this case we are the invaders.  Nelofer continues the story by returning to Afghanistan to try to find her lost friend Dyana as well as traveling to Russia to interview the men who invaded her country - fascinating and remarkable.	2005-10-11

I imagine it's long out of print, but I had to pick it up since I've always been a big fan of Larry Robinson. <br /> <br />This is a typical sports autobiography, not well written (not everyone can be Ken Dryden), but still entertaining.  I really enjoyed reading about the Canadiens teams of the '70s and '80s and Robinson was one of the key contributors to those teams.  Not many players have won six Stanley Cups, but he is one of the few, so we get to hear what it was like from a first-person perspective.  I also enjoyed reading about some of the Canadiens then-future stars like Patrick Roy and Chris Chelios to see what a veteran teammate thought of them at the beginning of their careers.  Funny to read about Patrick Roy being initially inconsistent, although Robinson correctly predicted that he would be in the same class as Grant Fuhr and Billy Smith if he ironed out his inconsistency. <br /> <br />So for writing skill, this is probably only three stars, but for content I'd call it four or five stars and that's why my final rating is four stars.	2005-10-11

This new book takes place a number of decades after her well-done King Philip's War while still being set within the context of the colonial period of American history.  This time the author looks at an urban setting, New York City, and the peculiar institution of slavery, particularly the so-called slave rebellion of 1840 which resulted in the burning and hanging of dozens of African American and a few white.  The sources are scanty, mainly relying on the printed pamplet of one of the judges, but Lepore does an impressive job of opening up the entire examination to effectively demonstrate how the trials were also about the meaning of liberty and the development of parties.  Both of these ideas would grow and develop, ultimately, into the American Revolution.  The author does a beautiful job of straddling the fine line between a popular work and a work of academic history.  A fine job.	2005-10-11

I am a native of Northwest Ohio and I am ashamed to say that I do not know much about the history of my region. I also have never read much on the history of Civil War except on the big battles that have been written about ~~ Gettysburg and Fredericksburg and so on. I never really paid attention in school (if the teachers did even mention it) regarding the Civil War soldiers from our area.  <br /> <br />Just by chance the other day at a festival that a little town in Ohio, Grand Rapids, hold every October, my family and I walked by this author's booth. My father bought this book. (I bought the other three books by this author because my interest in the Great Black Swamp area has been ignited by a series of newspaper articles a few years' back.)  <br /> <br />My dad read this book in three hours. I wasn't so lucky ~~ I do have two preschoolers ~~ but I managed to read it in two days. This is a very slim volume but it is full of historical tidbits about Civil War fighters from the Northwestern Ohio. It is full of emotion as the author compiled stories from old letters and poems written during this time. It is full of pictures. Every story in this book is a complete story. It is written very concisely and beautifully ~~ each character's voice was portrayed in a vivid way. In short, this book is a testament to heroes who just happened to live in a turblent time and did the best they could in their circumstances. It is a testament to those who have marched off to war and never returned home. This book has ignited a spark of interest on my behalf on the Civil War in the Cumberland Gap and other places in Tennessee and Kentucky as Sherman marched his way to Atlanta.  <br /> <br />If you are from Ohio ~~ even if you aren't! ~~ I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a Civil War or History buff. This book is a delightful addition to any American history student's library ~~ it is not boring (like too many history books are) and it is interesting. It is also a proud testament to the heroes from my part of the country ~~ these men are just ordinary men in extraordinary times ~~ and this book is exactly that! <br /> <br />10-11-05	2005-10-11
US	50810207	R52OG96MP1LF6	0312992424	454259013	Night Play (Dark-Hunter, Book 6)	Books	4	2	5	N	N	Bride Found Herself a Hunky Dog of a Man	NIGHT PLAY by Sherrilyn Kenyon reads like a high school wallflower's fantasy: the gorgeous bad boy falls for the slighted fat girl, and not only does he have money and beats up her meanie ex-boyfriend, but he's a good guy werewolf, too!     So, it's a cheesy story.  Formulaic, too, since almost all of Kenyon's heroes are carbon cutouts of one another: tough, tormented men with supernatural abilities and tortured pasts who somehow always manage to save the day from (seemingly) undefeatable enemies and hardships.    But I guess that's why I keep reading these books.  They're familiar and entertaining, no matter how cheesy.  I mean, I knew the moment I started reading NIGHT PLAY, it was going to suck me in, and nothing was going to keep me from finishing it, not even the need to sleep or go to the bathroom.    So, much like a drug, Kenyon's books are addictive - they're not necessarily good for you, but you can't stop from buying more and more!    Anyway, enough with the rant.  Back to NIGHT PLAY.      This is the story of Were-Hunter Vane, who you may remember as the werewolf in NIGHT EMBRACE.  If you have never read NIGHT EMBRACE, I suggest you back up and read that book first.  In fact, start the DARK-HUNTER series in order, beginning with its prologue FANTASY LOVER (about Julian), and going to NIGHT PLEASURES (Kyrian), NIGHT EMBRACE (Talon), DANCE WITH THE DEVIL (Zarek), KISS OF THE NIGHT (Wulf), and then NIGHT PLAY.  You're better off, as you will understand secondary characters, background, and inside jokes a lot better.    Vane initially met his heroine, Bride, in NIGHT EMBRACE, and their attraction brings them together in NIGHT PLAY.  I like Vane as a hero.  Being a wolf most of the time, he is totally clueless as to how humans interact, and that gives him a nice vulnerability that many past DARK-HUNTER heroes lacked.  Plus, he's genuinely a good guy.  He's not a jerk off, he has nothing to prove, and he's kind to animals and his own family members.  In fact, he's now one of my favorite characters, which includes Ash, Simi, and Zarek.    Bride is an interesting lady.  I've never read about a size-18 heroine before, especially one who is self-conscious about everything.  I liked the fact that Vane loved her immediately for who she is (and Kenyon was very convincing in showing why and how he could love her).  I'm not sure I liked her myself.  The one thing she said that really bugged me was how impressed she was that Vane was \\"loaded.\\"  To me, it's tacky to bring up finances right from the start of a relationship.  It's also shallow.      Anyway, Vane and Bride get involved, and then Vane's various family members begin hunting him down for the crime of being alive.  There's a little bit of time travel involved, and of course, there is Ash and his many interesting predictions.      Altogether, it was an entertaining story - though it did have some cheesy dialogue, etc.  So it's not perfect.  But it's enjoyable.  And it makes you want to read more.  Now I have to go buy SEIZE THE NIGHT (about Valerius).  Arrgh!	2005-10-11

Chris Ayres communicates clearly his ambivalence about the war and reporting from the battlefield. He feels badly for the Iraqis, but he also would rather they be dead than he and his Marine convoy. The better part of the book begins when he becomes a \\"war correspondent\\" and has to make his preparations to go to Iraq. The earlier chapters are Ayres just getting in backstory and it is not as compelling. His descriptions of being at the scene of the 9/11 attacks were real and disturbing. A funny thing about Ayres is he doesn't strike me as someone who should be a reporter. He expresses almost no curiosity about anything. Even when he could see the smoke coming from the World Trade Towers on 9/11, he didn't immediately go the site. He just thought it was an accident, and really had no interest in checking it out. When gathering up his equipment to go to Iraq, he displayed an astonishing amount of ignorance. If I were going to war, I would make sure I had all the right equipment--not in bright colors. The first half of the book was marred by his constant use of this annoying phrase: \\"veal-fattening pen.\\" I counted five times by page 95, twice on page 92--in the same paragraph. He also had a lot of product brand-name dropping: Neutrogena, Sony Vaio, Dolce & Gabbana, etc. Ayres was an unlikely candidate to be a war reporter, but he does his best (while squeezing his eyes shut and screaming) and the last half of the book is a good read.	2005-10-11

Books	3	12	20	N	N	Wonderful quotes, but still lacking	The aim of this book is to prove that the Early Church Fathers believed and taught the Reformation doctrine of Sola Scriptura, which proclaims both the \\"formal\\" and \\"material\\" sufficiency of Scripture (which is to say that Scripture is our final rule for all matters pertaining to faith, and that Scripture is perspicuous enough to be intelligently understood by anyone apart from what the \\"church\\" might say). To that end it consists entirely of quotes from the Fathers about Scripture.  <br /> <br />Many things struck me as I read this book. First of all, 95% of the quotes are irrelevant to proving the Reformed doctrine of Sola Scriptura, but are still wonderful quotes, and help to show us what a reverent and high view of Scripture the Fathers had. This is something that Protestants, Orthodox, and Catholics can all rejoice in.  <br /> <br />The second thing that struck me is that even the term \\"scripture\\" is misleading. The implication is that it means the 39 books of the Old Testament and 27 books of the New. But the New Testament canon wasn't even universally agreed upon until the late 300's AD. And what about the deutero-canonical books? The quote from St. Cyril on pages 59-60 tells us not to read the apocrypha (except for Baruch), nor should we read the book of Revelation! For many years, and by many churches, other early Christian writings were thought canonical, such as the Shepherd of Hermas, or the epistles of Clement and Barnabas. Most Early Fathers considered the Old Testament apocrypha to be canonical. So if Scripture is all we need, one must ask \\"Which Scripture?\\"  <br /> <br />A third thought is that if the Scriptures are as perspicuous as Protestants claim, then why do Protestants all differ with the almost universally held Patristic beliefs of baptismal regeneration, venerating the ever-virgin Mary, free will, the ability to fall from grace, the real presence of Christ in the eucharist, etc? If Scripture is so perspicuous, and if the Early Church fatherstruly believed in the Reformed doctrine of Sola Scriptura, then why didn't they understand that all these things are supposedly wrong? <br /> <br />Fourthly, it must be admitted that these quotes can be a bit misleading. Many of the opponents and heretics that these Fathers were fighting against believed solely in the authority of Scripture. (See, for example, Gregory of Nyssa's comments on pg. 75, paragraphs 1 and 4, and Augustine's comments on pg. 105, paragraph 3.) Thus, when arguing against them, the Fathers are OBVIOUSLY going to use scripture alone. They won't use Holy Tradition to counter a heretic if the heretic doesn't believe in Tradition to begin with. (Interestingly, on pg. 79, Gregory argues against someone \\"who interprets scripture at his own sweet will.\\" In other words, \\"Sola Scriptura\\"!) Likewise, the opening pages of the book show us Justin Martyr arguing against Trypho using scripture alone, and Trypho commending Justin for doing so. But does the casual reader realize that Trypho is a JEW? Obviously Justin can't appeal to Church tradition or even to the New Testament to prove Christianity. Again, when countering the Gnostic emphasis on mystery and secret knowledge, the Fathers are obviously going to emphasize scripture's perspicuity. This in no way proves they believed the Reformed doctrine of Sola Scriptura, but will lead the uninformed reader to think they did.  <br /> <br />Finally, though the casual reader wouldn't know this from these quotes alone, the Early Church Fathers generally did and taught things that aren't found anywhere in Scripture. Augustine, Basil, Hippolytus, and Tertullian (just for starters) all repeatedly taught the importance of making the sign of the cross on one's forehead, both for protection from the enemy as well as the right sign to accompany baptisms. Jerome (on pg. 81, paragraph 4) suggests a spiritual act found nowhere in scripture, involving a girl going to the temple with her parents. And of course \\"temple\\" is not a New Testament term to describe any building. These are all things that the Fathers could never arrive at if they truly believed in Sola Scriptura.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, this is a book filled with wonderful quotes that reveal the Early Fathers' beautifully high view of scripture, but it fails to accomplish its purpose. Unfortunately, without understanding the deeper context, the average Protestant is likely to read this book and say, \\"Aha! The Early Church Fathers REALLY WERE proto-Protestants. This proves it!\\"	2005-10-11

Elrod in the Vampire Files.  This novel picks up right where the last novel, Cold Streets, ends.  Jack Fleming, our hero vampire, is trying to overcome the physical and psychological damage he endured after being skinned alive (or skinned dead in Jack's case) by a sadistic, diabolical mobster from New York.  At the same time he's trying to fill in as mob boss for his pal Gordy, who is recovering from gunshot wounds incurred in the previous episode.  At the same time, there's an internal mob conspiracy to unseat Gordy and the target at the moment is Jack.  And he's not quite sure what to make of the New York mob boss, Whitey Kroun, who is trying to figure out what to do about Jack's killing of Hog Bristow - the nasty piece of work that did a little knife work on Jack.  All this swirls around a murder mystery tied into all these subplots.      While A Song in the Dark is a solid addition to the Vampire Files, it is a bit of let down.  While it ties up part of the loose ends from Cold Streets, it does little to advance the story of Jack Fleming, Charles Escott, and Bobbi Smythe.  Instead of moving the characters forward they are stuck in a rut.  We've seen Jack before grapple with his vampirism and frankly it is getting a little old.  And Escott and Bobbi, except for a few interludes of drama, are basically role players here.  This particular installment, for the most part, comes across as being a bit formulaic and drags out a little slowly.     There are some upsides to this novel though.  There is some great foreshadowing and surprises along the way that are deftly handled.  And the one character who does progress in the novel, in subtle ways, is Myrna, the resident ghost of Jack's nightclub, Lady Crymsyn.  There are also enough surprises along the way to jolt the reader back into the story just as the action is lagging.    For fans of this series, this will be an enjoyable read, but probably a bit of let down from Cold Streets.  And it is highly advisable to read Cold Streets prior to this novel, as a lot of what takes place is explained in the previous novel.    Finally, there is one big gaping hole left unfilled from Cold Streets.  Where is Gilbert Dugan?  In Cold Streets, Jack and Escott thwart another sadistic character who kidnapped a mentally disabled child.  He subsequently finds out Jack is a vampire and blackmails him.  After a confrontation with Jack he disappears.  Jack currently has Gordy's gang looking for him.  He is mentioned briefly early in A Song in the Dark - that he has not been found but that Jack has other things to worry about at the moment.  No doubt, the resolution of this dilemma sets up another installment of The Vampire Files.  Despite some of the drawbacks to A Song in the Dark, this reader looks forward to it.	2005-10-11

As the same time, I no longer crave a hot fudge sundae over a mango. Would it be hard to turn down my favorite junk food, the chocolate brownie? I don't know because I don't live for brownies anymore. If one stumbled into my path, I know one thing for sure. Eat it or not, I move on with a life that has passion beyond food.<br /><br />That philosophy evolved over the last 30 years. I was never a size \\"large.\\" But like so many of us, I was ruled by food. And I have worked with scores of persons who weren't quite as lucky as me. Their cravings for food were inextricable from weight gain and constant dieting.<br /><br />It seems that our emotional make-up perpetuates a desperate search for that one diet that defies failure. My search has been a different one. As a biochemist and registered dietitian, I pondered the mystery of why the process of dieting is ineffective - in the long run. This investigative process has spanned decades, and the answer has been surprising. Quite simply: Life causes obesity. Food is the vehicle. You become the victim.<br /><br />In today's world it's nearly impossible not to overeat too often and sit around too much of the time. But that's not the whole story - it's just the most obvious scenario. You are the target of more than worldly food temptations, spectator sports, and internet searches. You are at the mercy of an ancient brain struggling in a very different world, where food allows a few minutes of serenity, peace, or a \\"bite\\" of joy.<br /><br />These are exciting, yet scary times. The exposure to worldwide news 24 hours a day unveils the alarming increase in obesity as well as the shocking rise in anxiety, depression, violent behavior, and suicide. Is this a warning that life needs mending?<br /><br />In 1998, the medical professional acclaimed tht health care providers should counsel overweight patients to stop gaining weight. But as a health professional. what do you say? Do you suggest another diet? Will we continue to work blindly on calorie intake and body fitness, while the brain wallows in what might be called an unfit status for today's world? How can we stop gaining weight in such a state?<br /><br />Until now. the success rate for weight management is limited to a pitiful 5%. STOP GAINING WEIGHT presents the \\"big picture,\\" a rationale for why we are so drawn to so many unhealthy behaviors, what they have to do with weight, and how we can put these behaviors behind us, and in the process, stop gaining weight.  -excerpts from author's notes inside coversher diet?

He is troubled with looking like an ogre being born deformed. The doctors said that he will be like that for the rest of his life. His mother left him to go live in the big city and his father, who is also his mother's father, is in jail or maybe even dead.  <br /> <br />   Left to the care of Lucas, Mathias lives out his life from an intelectual stand point. Lucas taught him that while other children would grow big and strong, so would he. Mathias corrected Lucas knowing damn well the sadness of the truth. Lucas explained that he would work hard on his mind a grow an ever strong unsderstanding of the world around him. Sure enough, Mathias did just that and was the envy of all his classmates for always having the right answers. <br />    <br />   Lucas loved Mathias very much, but was only a boy himself when he took on the responsibility of raising him. Lucas is a very unikely Father being one with such a disturbed past and shady presence. He goes around the city making money at night by playing his harmonica in bars and by selling produce by day. His relationships are very odd including the priest of the town who he plays chess with on a nightly basis. Lucas himself does not believe in God, but the priest takes the role of a father figure for him in the story. He also has relations of a more intimate kind with 2 women and a man in the story. <br /> <br />   I first read \\"The Notebook\\" when I was in High School. A Video Game known as \\"Earhtbound 64\\" (never released) had led me to read this story. ONe character from that game would have been based from this story. I had no idea what I was about to read. It definitely warped my mind as a youth and became an instant favorite. Now 5 years later I read \\"The Proof\\" and remembered why it is I had enjoyed \\"The Notebook\\" so much tp begin with. <br /> <br />   This story is definitely not for the weak at stomach. It is can become pretty disturbing and downright sickening at some points of the story. It is, however, very well written and leaves feeling emotions the characters must have felt when they were going through the events in their lives.	2005-10-11

My 14 yr old (very picky reader) daughter was drawn to read this book by the cover. She had her Bat Mitzvah last year. Sometimes you CAN judge a book by its' cover. She read it constantly, even walking around the house and then told me I HAD to read it. I am glad I did as it is laugh out loud funny and true to the highs and lows of teenage emotions. Some events were definitely more (advanced) than my daughter has lived through, but the book exposed her to far less than a typical PG-13 movie. I highly recommend this book and plan to share it with other teenagers through our Temple library. Although we read the book from the post Bat Mitzvah stand point, this is a book that would appeal to anyone who is experiencing or has lived through that time of flucuating emotions and friendships that is so common to the teenage years.

Several months ago, Tess, a computer analyst, helped Nash save his best friend and colleague Decker from a potential hit.  With the adrenaline running high and eyes wide open, Nash and Tess had a one night stand after all was said and done.  Now, they are part of a team sent to Kazbekistan to help recover a laptop with enough information that could put a major dent in the fight against terrorism.  Can these two work together or will their attraction get them killed?<br /><br />Flashpoint is a fast paced, edge of your seat thriller set in Kazbekistan.  Nash is a bad ass agent who plays hard and works harder.  His nonchalant attitude has gotten him in trouble more than once.  In the case of Tess, his best friend Decker has some feelings for her that Nash either fails to realize or can't resist.  It's an interesting subplot of two friends attracted to the same woman.  At first, I didn't know who I wanted to root for, but as the plot thickened Nash seemed to be the better choice despite his dark side.  He has enough personal issues to fill a book, but with Tess he shows a softer edge.  He begins to care about her as a person rather than a potential lay or fellow agent.  The moments of tenderness he shows made me realize he is a good man.  He just doesn't know how to express himself.  He has been an agent for so long that I don't think he knows how to be anything else.  It's like he doesn't know where his life as an agent ends and he, as a person, begins.<br /><br />Tess is an awesome computer analyst, but a green field agent.  On her first assignment, she is out of her element.  In Kazbekistan, she sees the worst that reality has to offer but still remains upbeat.  Her optimism was a breath of fresh air even in the darkest times.  I admired her stubbornness and love for Nash because she could see the person he could be under all of the arrogance and attitude.  Yet she would not ask for more than what he could offer.  She would not beg him to love her.  It was all or nothing for her.<br /><br />Flashpoint is my first Suzanne Brockmann book, but definitely not my last.  The characters are richly detailed and flawed.  Tess, Nash and the secondary characters are real.  Under the harshest conditions, they do and see things that would make a normal person cringe.  I was riveted by the story and all of the subplots that were seamlessly interwoven throughout the book.  Each one helped drive the story, not diminishing the overall storyline.  I could not stop reading because I needed to know what happened next.  I hope each of the secondary characters will have their own story because they are so fascinating.

Thus began his legendary ghost walks, and Felix  rapidly became one of Britain's foremost ghost hunters and experts on the paranormal. Within 12 years more than 150,000 people from all over the world had booked in to the tours.  As Felix himself avuncularly writes: \\"... I was raised in a haunted house [so] you will forgive me for having well formed ideas about the existence of ghosts.\\"<br /><br />His books are fascinating and informative.  Each site in South Wales is described with historical background, photos, anecdotal evidence, and both subjective and objective investigative findings.

This work is sure to please anyone who has caught the ghost-hunting bug.<br /><br />Richard Felix is well published in the U.K., and can currently be seen in the States on the television show Most Haunted, broadcast on the Travel Channel, where he functions as historian on what is arguably the best ghost hunting show ever filmed.

Yes, there are some bugs and I did have a certain amount of trouble running some of the days code.         Nevertheless, the book does seem to have some merit: It is, for the most part, clearly written and, for an introductory text, the example programs seem very ambitious, and thus interesting and almost useful in their own right, something that is rare in many introductory texts.         The author seems to be a very good C++ programmer and the presentation is very clear and concise - it just seems that the book may have been written and finished in haste, hence the (fairly \\"minor\\") errors and bugs that appear. Additionally, the downloadable source code does not always match that of the book making the programming somewhat confusing at times.Additionally, there are some lines that are in the book but commented out in the source code - apparently they had to be for the code to compile correctly.       A better introductory book on MFC is Herb Schildt's MFC Programming From the Ground Up, 2nd edition,also written for Visual C++ version 6. Schildt's book is bug free and as an introductory text it does not use the Visual C++ AppWizard and  Document/View architecture until the final chapters, thus truly teaching MFC fundamentals without the confusion inherent in the AppWizard and Document/View code.	2005-10-11

It's obvious there are \\"1-star rate spamming\\" & \\"recommendation spamming\\" going on here. The majority of the 1-star reviews have the same vitriolic and hateful tone - they probably haven't even done one thing the book suggests or want to ignore or hide the possible reality that the FDA, drug companies and friends might be strongly motivated by dollars, which is causing conflicts of interest and carelessness (Vioxx).   <br /> <br />The reason why this book has a low number of stars right now is because shortly after the book was released and since, a group of negative reviewers have repeatedly posted fowl and hateful remarks about the author as a person and not about the book.  Also, some of the truly helpful reviews (with references to other books and sites even) with a high rating are repeatedly and mindless marked \\"Not useful\\". Wow, they even take the time to try to discredit honest helpful reviews.  It's really unfortunate this kind of immaturity is happening and that a certain group of people (and/or agencies?) are stooping this low. So the point is, don't let reviews influence your decision, heck even mine if you want. <br /> <br />Look, this MIGHT be a person's first look, a \\"wake-up call\\" into healthy living and natural remedies!... anything other than advice from MD's.  The infomercial is brilliant because he's reaching out to a lot of people, especially couch potatoes - they get a glimpse of what they can do.  If you're gonna bash the book, keep that in mind. <br /> <br />Kevin mentions his subscription website.  I don't plan on subscribing because this book was a enough of a launchpad for me to have great health for my young children and me.  I'm grateful for the \\"kick in the pants\\" and \\"wake-up call\\" the book gave me because I was literally allowing my children to slowly poison themselves.  I'm glad he's good at marketing because I haven't come across this kind of thing until now.  I'm sure there are superior books than this but it was Kevin's that came into my awareness first, which led me to other fine sources.  Seriously, the wake-up call is priceless - it's allowed me to realize how easy it is to take responsibility for the foods we eat.  Our family drinks ZERO soda now - we save so much money and we don't miss the loaded sugars and artificial sweeteners (look up aspartame and sucralose).  And fast food? Fuggetaboutit.  Ever thought about all the junk and lack of nutrients in those things?   And we used to frequently pay good money for that junk.  And think of all the young kids out there living on this stuff, makes me cringe.  So for the bashers, have you done anything similar to improve your lives? <br /> <br />To quote someone: would I have liked all the \\"cures\\" to be in his book instead of referring to his website?  Definitely.  I wish I knew if he really is prevented from putting them in his book for legal reasons and if he is, A) is everyone prevented from doing it? or B) is it not really the law of the land, but his restriction is part of his FTC lawsuit settlement? If it's \\"A\\", then the route he takes is valid, if it's \\"B\\", well, I wish he would reveal it, but the route would still be valid. If he really isn't prevented from printing them in his book, then I think the book would be misleading.  He says he doesn't receive any kickbacks from the health food products, treatments, and healing gizmos he recommends. <br /> <br />And especially if you have young children, I urge you to check this book or other related books. <br /> <br />All the best.	2005-10-11

However, I was very disappointed for the following reasons:  1) the story was too simplistic (and full of tired cliches), 2) the characters were one-dimensional stereotypes and 3) the main characters (and their family) were claustrophobic in their smug superiority.  I have seen too many families that present just this outward image while hiding a truth that would be more beneficial for all to see the light of day.  Isn't it ironic now that the theme of the distorted family image of the O'Sulivan family is in fact duplicated by the depiction of the Coyne/McGrail clan. <br /> <br />Surely I won't be coming back for a second helping.	2005-10-11

Roth makes this event and its aftermath credible as alternative history, which is the strength of the novel.  Unfortunately, it is not nearly as well written as we might expect from such an author, and in fact I found that the novel did not really come alive until perhaps halfway through.   <br />     Two of the problems are the character, Alvin, and the choice of a narrator who is initially 8 years old.  Alvin goes off to fight the Nazi's by volunteering in Canada. This might have been the basis of an exploration of what a Jewish US citizen owed to his fellow Jews in Europe, but it wasn't, and the character proves more a distraction and page filler than anything else.  The narrator is a nicely written character, but as a young boy, he is not the best choice as an observer.  As the boy ages, this remedies itself. In fact, as the book progresses the mother and her sister and even the father come more alive, and the plot quickens, both for the family and the country.  The novel also begins to work as social history of a closely knit, lower middle class community.  <br />     In the novel's wrap up, mention is made of a book about the events written by the Rabbi.  I believe Roth is poking fun at conspiracy theories and the motivations of those who write them, but some reviewers apparently fail to distinguish between the Rabbi's book, and what Roth purports to have happened.	2005-10-11

I don't know if anybody else has noticed this, but Micheal Ende must have been spiritually enlightened, to have written this book. <br /> <br />For starters, the fact that Bastain reads a story and becomes part of it, is Ende's way of telling the reader that everything is just a story, even Bastians \\"Reality\\". <br /> <br />Fantastica is a creation of the human mind. For a human to exist they're mind needs to be full of stories. That's why fantastica dies when no human makes up stories for it. <br /> <br />At the Southern Oracle, Ende perfectly descirbes what it is to become spiritually enlightened. <br /> <br />Atreyu must pass through three magic gates. <br /> <br />The first one Is guarded by two sphinxes. If the sphinxes open their eyes as atreyu is walking through he will be rooted to the spot until he has answered all the riddles in the universe. <br /> <br />The second gate is a magic mirror gate, in which you see a reflection of yourself. It states in the book that some people run screaming from what they see in that mirror. That's because alot of people aren't aware of their true self, and if someone were to show them what they really are, they would be terrified. Sometimes people go to seek emotional help, and they find out who they really have become, and it's not easy. That's what Ende was showing us with the Magic Mirror gate. It shows the truth. <br /> <br />The third gate, doesn't open unless you forget why you wanted to go through it. This is one of the most amazing ideas ever. <br /> <br />If you want to become enlightened you can't, because to become enlightened, you must let go of your story (your mind). So for the mind to \\"want\\" to get enlightened, it gets in the way. Your story needs to be gone, before you can become enlightened. You can't \\"Want\\" to become enlightened. So that's what the third gate is. <br /> <br />Then we come to the Old man of Wandering mountain, where we learn that the Neverending story is a story that has already been written, and is unchangable before and after, and in starting to read the story from the beginning creates a vicious cycle that will never end unless Bastian breaks it. We learn there that our whole life is just a story in our imagination. <br /> <br />Later in the book, Bastain learns that Fantastica lies on a bed of memories. This is because we would not exist without memories. <br /> <br />Think about it. Your whole lives story is a memory. Fantasica is a story of the human mind, and the human mind is based on memories. Then he must forget who he his, to go back to his world. In other words become enlightened. Let go of the \\"self\\", the \\"I\\" that is just an illusion. <br /> <br />This is a brilliant book. I've read it 2 or 3 times, and am in the middle of reading it again. It is SO amazing. <br /> <br />The old man of wandering mountain (chapter 12) is one of the most brilliant sections of writing I have ever read. It nails the nature of the universe more clearly than any science book, astrology, or anything that's meant to teach what Michal Ende put so brilliantly into this book. <br /> <br />If you've already read it, read it again with this in mind. It's like a different story.	2005-10-11

I also found that the info on prehistoric animals barely touchs on each prehistoric period.    I purchased the book for its continental drift information and maps.  In this area, I am a little disappointed.  The maps provided do not show the complete landmass of each period.  Each map only shows half of the Earth, and the other half is never shown in a separate map.  Not being able to see the whole landmass for each period is a little annoying given that this is the main purpose for the book.

I had never read any of Nancy Farmer's works before Sea of Trolls.  I chose this book because I'm interested in the time period described.  I really wasn't expecting much, but Farmer provided a tour-de-force.  She includes many interesting touches, such as the use of the sunstone for navigation, the attitudes towards Picts, the Druids' legendary ability to call up fog, and the fact that northern Norway does have a district called Jotunheim.  Farmer creatively interweaves history and myth, usually with good effect. <br /> <br />When I read Sea of Trolls for the second time, I picked up on some of the more subtle aspects.  Jack is apprenticed by the Bard because he can sing and remember--and in a society where most people don't read or write, remembering and speaking well are of great importance.  Jack visits different cultures and learns of the various beliefs that were active during this time; Anglo-Saxon, Pict, Irish, Finnish and Scandinavian cultures mingle uneasily, as Northern Europe is on the brink of change from the Migration Age to the Feudal Age.  Jack's goal is to free his sister and return to his parents, and Jack's family life contrasts neatly with that of Olaf and of Thorgil.   <br />Although brief, glimpses of the admixture of culture and beliefs are provided by Farmer. <br /> <br />I ordered extra copies of this book for gifting.  Sea of Trolls is interesting as a story, and it could be used as a tool to look deeper into our own attitudes towards others and towards our own history.  I think anyone would like this book, boy and girl, young and old, heathen and pagan and Christian.	2005-10-11

Their facts and presentation carried me back to that era. But, I am uncomfortable with the intensionality that the term 'Dark' might leave in the reader so grant me the right to give an added facet.  <br /> <br /> <br />As a senior at MIT during the 1959-1960 semesters I had the honor working with Weiner. Up front, my review  arises from an unabashed gratitude and affection for a man whose influence and help were instrumental for all the good things that later transpired in my life over the last 45 years.  <br /> <br />One day in the fall of 1959 I was walking near Weiner's office after having come out of Dirk Struik's office from a discussion of an item in the Advanced Tensor Analysis course I was taking from him. Just as I was passing by his office the classical Norbert Weiner yelled out \\" young man, can you come in and finish the calculations on the board\\". Honestly, I was totally naive and did not know anything about him except having seen him in the corridors.  <br /> <br />\\"Sure\\" I said. As I entered the office he walked out. There on the dusty chalk  board were a facsimile of a spread sheet, with rows of numbers scribbled across the board. I could not admit that I had no idea what the numbers represented, let alone what I was to do. Ego is a wonderful goad for creative problem solving. Seeing a number that looked like the sine of 30 degrees I quickly deciphered that the alternating lines were discrete values of the sine function, the parallel lines were filled with some varying numbers from a seemingly smooth function, andthe next line looked like some multiplication/ addition of both. Norman Levinson's  course in Complex Anaylsis came to the rescue. Weiner was performing a discrete fast Fourier Transform. Ten minutes later Weiner came in and saw that I had almost completed the spread sheet.  <br /> <br />Looking over his glasses he asked \\"What are you doing here?\\". \\"Helping you, Professor\\" I responded, startled. \\"Can you come back tomorrow for some more work?\\" \\"Sure\\"  <br /> <br />It turned out that he was perfroming a spectral analysis on a  section of EEG readings Dr. John Barlow had given Weiner. <br />I eventually had to hand read the red graph and number the amplitudes. The picture appears in CYBERNTETICS 2nd edition. <br /> <br />One Saturday he directed me to \\"sit down and write\\". After a few lines I had the timerity to inquire what the heck was I doing. <br />His answer: \\"I'm dictating the upgrade to my book CYBRENETICS\\". My mistake was to inform him that I could touch type. Zap! Three hours later I threw in the towel. From then on, after math classes I would be sitting typing and learning more ideas and mathematical insight than any of the past 3.5 years. Note, no word processor, no electric type writer. The old fashioned finger toughening for Karate thrust kind. <br /> <br />My many mistaken sheets were then handed over to Weiner's secretary who produced a finished draft. <br /> <br />When the galleys came out I, among many others, reviewed and corrected them. <br /> <br />Weiner informed me that he considered \\"his students as colleagues\\" and he gave me the honor and respect that it entailed. <br />I noticed over the years that the truly great and self assured, including Doc Edgerton in Electric Engineering, treated with  respect f those 'under' them. The not so great and their undeserved pomposity are legion in all walks of life. <br /> <br />A few vignettes of his Puckish sense of humor which were seen  quite often are in order. <br /> <br />One Saturday, Weiner, who hadto check his urine for sugar, came into the office to check it. \\"Good, all is well\\", he smiled, \\"Here, take it and dispose of it\\". <br /> <br />My response was as brash as anything I had ever done \\"Prof. Weiner, I have the deepest respect for you. I have had my rump fall asleep while tying your manuscript for hours. But, you take your G.. D....d sample yourelf\\" <br /> <br />Weiner burst out in laughter \\"Well, I tried.\\" and waddled off. I just keeled over with laughter. <br /> <br />Weiner was subject to many folks who came to 'worship at his feet' and try to have him help on hair brained schemes. <br />Once such soul came in one day and proceded to blather. Norbert rose, took him by the elbow with a \\"I know someone who will really be able to help you\\", and dumped into Struick's office. From across the hall we heard Struik's Dutch yelling, while chasing the man out. Then, flushed faced, Dirk leaned into the office and hissed \\"Norbert, stop dumping your garbage into my office!\\" , and popped out. Norbert broke into a loud chuckle, looke at me, and just smiled. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />A few years later Mrs. Weiner called and told me that Norbert was in Mass.General as he had fallen down and done serious damge to himself. I overcame my deep antipathy to hospitals and took my self over.  <br />She informed me that the Professor was in a bad way and Prof. Lee had just left, totally depressed at seeing his mentors state. She told me not to stay too long but to see if I could get him to respond. <br />Entering his room, I heard Norbert moaning, leaning away from the door. How the wonderful inspiration came to me I have never figured out.  <br /> <br />As I walked to his bed , in my most stentorian voice, I said \\"What 14 carat plated phoney!\\" He moaned, tried to turn, and went back to moaning.   <br />\\"There is nothing wrong with you. I know you well enough to know that you faking it, just to avoid being drafted\\". <br /> <br />Much as he tried not to, he let out aloud laugh. I continued \\"I bet you are pestering all the doctors like Barlow, that Fourier Anaylysis and Tauberian Theorems can solve all medical problems. They have to listen to you!\\" <br /> <br />At that he slowly sat up, reached for his glasses and then went into a long story of how indeed he had such ideas, etc. <br /> <br />Mrs. Weiner was clearly taken aback at my brashness and when Norbert sat up she did not know what to do. While happily pontificating Norbert said \\"Margaret, light up a cigar for me\\". She lit up one his 'stinkies', handed it to him, and Norber was on his way. Soon after Frau Professor chased me out but I was elated beyond words. <br /> <br />That was the last time I ever saw Weiner but this wonderful book captured so many facets of this rare, great human, <br /> <br />My gratitude.

As a resident of the Cow Neck Peninsula, which encompasses Manhasset and other communities of the North Shore of Long Island , I have visited Publican's, and its predecessor and successor entities, many times.  Most of my times there were spent as a diner rather than a drinker. I never found it to a particularly notable place, offering ordinary food and a large,dark bar area.  That having been said.............. <br /> <br />I found this book to be extremely well written by a most talented young writer, but the subject matter and the cast of characters were of little sustaining interest.  Perhaps JR is modeling himself after the Hemingway and O'Neill members of the writing fraternity. Perhaps the first 30 years of his life enabled him to find something about which to write.  But the crux of this book and that which has prepared him to be, potentially, so fine a writer occurred in the following decade or so of his life, culminating in the events of and the aftermath of 9/11.  It is during this period that his maturity becomes evident...when he stopped depending on the crutch of drinking...took hold of his responsibilities...and only then placed in perspective the important pieces that make up the composition of \\"life\\".  Unfortunately, the great body of this work is Much Ado About Very Little, aimlessly passing time, wasting time and education, and living in the narrow focus of the bar and its inhabitants. <br /> <br />Still, the book is a worthwhile read if for no other reason than to see how Mr. Moehringer grows and continues to mature in his future endeavors. <br />	2005-10-11

About 12 years ago I found this book in a suitcase that contained some of my grandmother's books. Since then I read it every year at Christmas time.  <br /> <br />     The book contains a number of unique short stories. The title of each story doesn't give much of a clue to the plot or subject. But after reading the story it makes perfect sense. Each story makes you want to keep reading further. <br /> <br />     I can't think of a book that touches me in a way \\"Journey Into Christmas\\" does.

It is really about the basic fundamentals that make any martial art work properly when you take your dojo skills on the street. This is good solid stuff, not particularly exciting, but absolutely essential, cerebral, and right on. The authors are highly skilled and their experience really resonates within these pages.<br /><br />As most long-term martial artists know, earning a black belt is really just the beginning of a practitioner's martial journey. Since obtaining mine I discovered that the more I know, the more I realize that the fundamentals are paramount. That's the focus of this book. The SWOT analysis is an important tool described herein. It stands for Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat, an invaluable tool for error detection as you place your techniques under a microscope. Essential nuances of structure, posture, body mechanics, and positioning are critical for success and well described herein. The writing is clear, articulate, and easy to follow. The highlighted practice hints are a nice addition too.<br /><br />My only complaint, which frankly is pretty minor, is that the pictures do not have very good contrast and there are harsh vertical lines on the wall in the background of many of them that make them a little challenging to view. Furthermore, there really are not enough photos to illuminate everything properly unless you've been practicing martial arts for a while and understand what the authors are talking about.<br /><br />There is a very short section on the purpose of weapons and weapons training and a brief overview of what happens when you utilize this knowledge in the real world but the vast majority of the materials are focused on getting the basics right.

Valerie Hemingway, a teen when she met Hemingway, seems to have been an aspiring journalist and to have done some editing since, though obviously she makes no great claim as a writer.  The question is what she has to say, and frankly this writer not only has some new revelations about Hemingway and his family which are more than mere gossip, but posesses a degree of wisdom and balance, all in all something to say about life.<br /><br />The first half of the book deals with Valerie's relationship with Ernest and Mary Hemingway, in Spain and Cuba, 1959-1961.  The author is eerily present in each line Valerie writes, well recognizable from other known accounts, but she adds her own valuable and to some degree deeper take.  She was a perceptive girl who Hemingway (who always enjoyed tough young \\"Summer People\\" as he once memorably termed them) obviously had good reason to like. But just as obviously it has taken her years to meditate on this material and get it right.<br /><br />Hemingway's funeral and her meeting with Gregory are then told,  including her touchy relationship with Mary Hemingway.  Here one perhaps wishes for a little more, but the fact is no one yet has been able to properly get an angle on Hemingway's fox terrier of a fourth wife who stuck it out for hell on earth and was thereby seriously damaged afterwords.<br /><br />An interlude then concerns the Irish playwright Brendan Behan, by whom Valerie had a son.  And finally the rest -- which comes to feel like the majority of the book -- concerns the third \\"bull\\" in her life, Ernest's third and tragic son Gregory, whom Valerie married.  This seemingly private and sensational story, on the charming Dr.Gregory and his finally all-encompassing transvestism disorder, is nonetheles as relevant to Hemingway studies as the first half of the book.  Gregory was the model for one of Thomas Hudson's sons in Islands in the Stream, and the subject behind the meditation in a little known late short story, \\"I Guess Everything Reminds You of Something.\\"  Gregory also wrote his own justly acclaimed take on Ernest which pulled no punches.  The product of Ernest's stormy second marriage, there were scars from the beginning which are duly reflected in his realist father's letters and fiction.<br /><br />Even more relevantly, the whole issue of family illnesses and psychoses, which emerges in the Gregory material, throws light back on Hemingway's fictionalized relationship with his own father in the Nick Adams stories, plus the whole issue of hidden psychic wounds in most major Hemingway characters first explored by the early and pioneering Hemingway critic Phillip Young.  The fact is psycho-sexual issues permeate Hemingway biography because they lay under his body of his fiction like an iceberg. Those taking Valerie to task for the revelations herein, and arbitrarily labeling her a goldbrick and the 2nd half of the book as worthless, are simply uninformed.  Gregory was apparently the saddest victim of something haunting his family for the three generations that have been documented.  Valerie therefore has nothing to be ashamed of.  Nor does she ask for your applause, either.<br /><br />Moreover, her frank story of Gregory Hemingway's obsessive downfall is rather courageous.  The very private sort of sexual psychosis Gregory had may well be more common than generally known, and will always likely cause shame and scorn to both the victim and his family to become known.  Valerie could therefore only risk exposing herself to ridicule to publish this, and  most people would have buckled to that threat. In that case a very important chronicle of a family's struggle with this sort of downfall would not be available.  The telling is neither sensational, bitter, nor confused -- it is straight up realism professionally told.  It is loving and quite starkly human.  It will certainly help families burdened by the same affliction in their midst.rkly human.  It will certainly help families burdened by the same affliction in their midst.	2005-10-11

Boulevard of Broken Dreams is a fascinating comic about the steady decline of an animator named Ted and the industry into which he breathed new life.  An animation company of the '30s era creates \\"Waldo the Cat\\" shorts, but with the rise of Disney, the company tosses originality in favor of the cutesy watered-down style that has become so popular.  New bosses, scandal, and tragedy rides the degradation of the cartoons all the way into the '90s.  And all the while, Ted is tormented by hallucinations of the cartoon cat he created.  This is the twisted story that Deitch has woven. <br /> <br />And it's a good one, to be sure.  From Ted's mind springs a popping, psychedelic world brimming with confusion and madness.  While Ted is engulfed by his delusions, the people around him, his shifty brother Al, his uncertain romantic interest Lillian, and the aging great Winsor Newton all face the harsh realities of a business that loses its heart.  The story makes references to classic animators, so cartoon history buffs can enjoy a few in-jokes.  Tension and mystery abound, and it's a wonderful story for those who understand alienation or like a bit of bizarro reading.	2005-10-11

I picked up a bunch of paperbacks at a rummage sale and there were a half-dozen of these types of stories all by different authors.  That said, \\"Sugar Cookie Murder\\" wasn't one of the better ones.   <br /> <br />Since I haven't read any of the previous books in this series, I have only this book to base my opinions on and that might be unfair.  However, this is supposed to be a stand-alone book. <br /> <br />Anyway, as several reviewers noted, the \\"mystery\\" was hardly a mystery at all.  The climax was horribly disappointing -- a quick confession and bang, end of mystery.  Apparently the cops did nothing but guard the doors and the detective sat in an office being cranky while Hannah and her sisters ran around and solved the \\"mystery\\".  Almost all the action -- such as it was -- took place in the banquet hall and focused on describing food.  Lots of food.  With a few million references to how cold it gets in Minnesota and how everyone there can drive through a blizzard like it was a warm sunny day.  Obviously there is a history between all the residents which, fortunately, wasn't too heavy-handed although it did get kind of confusing now and then. <br /> <br />I didn't particularly like the characters, either.  Again, the shallowness of everyone might have been because it's part of a series and there was more character-building earlier on.  But Hannah came off as a bit whiney, controlling and indecisive.  She has two guys on a string -- one is too good to be true but kind of ordinary, the other is an obnoxious, self-serving cop who is apparently hot for his secretary and Hannah both making him a class-A jerk, but he's a hunk so Hannah seems to cozy up with him moreso than the other guy.  But she uses the other guy whenever it suits her so she's not much better than the cop.  The sisters seemtwo dimensional, the mother is a ditz and the rest of the cast are mere shadows on the wall. <br /> <br />The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 (too bad sometimes you can't give 0 stars!) was because I am hoping/assuming the earlier books were better and this was just a filler book.  If I run across more of Joanne Fluke's books at a rummage sale I might buy them but I'm sure I won't be spending full price -- paperback or hardcover -- for any of them. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

The book moves between (overly) scholarly erudition at times to almost poetic prose at others.  You will defiantly feel where the action picks up and where it drops off...but it is understandable when you are trying to build a scholarly case on this subject. <br /> <br />Essentially he argues that liberalism (free markets, limited government, and individual rights) lost the battle in the 20th century, but had been on a decline since the late 1800s in some areas.  The result was a century of warfare, massacres, and sustained poverty. <br /> <br />The scholarly work and assumptions made in this book are not the work of childish or child like intelligence.  It is quite the opposite.  Have you ever heard a free market advocate arguing \\"Look even a child understands it, it must be true!\\"  Never, such are the arguments of communists and socialists.  The real childish assumptions come overwhelmingly from the global left.  The belief that poverty can be solved simply be re-distributing wealth shows painful ignorance of the economics involved. (though Lindsey is not hostile to \\"saftey nets\\"...I don't believe in the free market long run saftey nets will be needed at all...politically I recognize they would be necessary to get anything accomplished, but only if they are made more effecient like a negative tax proposed by Milton Friedman) Further ignorance is demonstrated through their assumptions that free markets exploit.  Free markets are based on voluntary transactions, and as a voluntary transaction IT CANNOT BE EXPLOITIVE.   <br /> <br />I agree with Lindsey that the leftist assumptions are the results of years of fallacious reasoning...intentionally or unintentionally; they are wrong on almost all accounts.  I however find their love for their fellow human and desire to increase the welfare of society to be admirable, their solutions however are the causes to the problems they address.  They don't understand history, politics, or economics.  And they always blame the market for problems that the market often did not cause by conveniently forgetting or ignoring the government involvement in the creation of said problem (example, the Asian Financial Crisis of the late 1990s...always blamed on free market capitalism when in fact fixed exchange rates, policies of the government not free trade, were a major cause of the crisis). <br /> <br />Current empirical evidence suggests, as Lindsey agrees, that economic freedom is strongly connected to civil and political freedom.  That is, the more economically free a country is the more civil and political freedom the citizens enjoy...what we now call democracy is realized. <br /> <br />It is no coincidence that the forces who tried the hardest to suppress economic freedom also killed off vast portions of their populations...these are the Fascist and Communist governments that the Left have confused as polar opposites...they are not, both hate economic freedom and as a result both hate civil and political freedom. <br /> <br />Lindsey goes through great detail to list the conditions in the rise of liberalism and its decline.  With the help of Hayek and Friedman he shows how government intervention and anti liberal policies helped bring about WWI, the great depression and WWII.  The results of all of these were a belief that markets don't work and governments do.    In the end, we live in a world that still fears globalization and free markets...a world that conflates free markets with mercantilism and continues to argue that free markets don't work in fact its their very own policy preferences that continue to cause global problems. <br /> <br />Example:  protectionism (tariffs and quotas) protect the wealth of the first world capital owners at the expense of the first world consumers (who pay higher prices) and third world laborers (who have more difficulty finding employment) and third world capital owners (who find difficulty in creating and maintaining an export industry).  PROTECTIONISM IS A WEALTH TRANSFER FROM POOR TO RICH, that ironically most leftists seem to accept ignorantly unaware that in no way are workers actually protected.  Free trade is the opposite of this.  Barriers are removed, jobs are created between both first and third world countries, trade ensues, both sides are lifted up through increasing prosperity and wealth creation. <br /> <br />Free markets are not the end all for the debate in this book.  Lindsey recognizes that the forces that destroyed liberalism once before are still at work.  Their arguments, assumptions, and ignorance still lives and has the potential to again mobilize a mass movement against liberalism...and ironically for totalitarianism. That being said, the summary of his book is that globalization and free markets are not inevitable nor invinsible. <br /> <br />No hard core leftist will read this book and suddenly be converted. They will likely throw confused fits of frustration and show little ability to counter the arguments found inside. Classic Liberals and those more favorable to the free market will find themselves with a highly compelling argument in this book that will strengthen their own understanding of globalization.  Those who find themselves in the center will find a book that challenges many of the major assumptions that most of society accepts...it may leave you wondering exactly how you went through your entire education and were never presented with any of these arguments or facts. <br /> <br />But the sad state of public education is another book altogether...  :P	2005-10-11

I bought this book after reading the Amazon reviews.  I was in the mood for a fantasy series, and this was the best I could find.  Well, the positive reviews are right.  I'm almost done with book 2, and it's only getting better.  At first, I was put off by the first-person storytelling.  After a while, you get used to it.  Hobb also goes a little overboard with some of the stilted Old English.  Mostly, though, the characters are well-defined and loveable.  I disagree that this book isn't meant for kids.  Yes, a major feature is that the main character is a \\"bastard,\\" and they use that term a lot.  The violence, gore, and sex, however, happen almost entirely \\"off-screen.\\"  I'd say this is a good series for teens of about 14 or 15 years old, but holds my interest at age 31.  It's not the most complicated or literary stuff, but it's very enjoyable for someone who loved the Belgariad as a young teen, and read Robert Jordan, but gave up after reading book upon book and getting nowhere (see reviews of the Wheel of Time series).   <br /> <br />The \\"bad guys\\" in the series are perhaps a little uncomplicated, but we don't spend TOO much time with them. <br /> <br />Anyone who says this series is \\"dark\\" is a little too sensitive.

In BROKEN PREY, there are only two subplots, one of them involving Sloan, Lucas Davenport's Minneapolis homicide detective sidekick, the other consisting of the top 100 Rock songs for Lucas's new iPod. Sloan is thinking of retiring and opening a bar, appropriately named Shooters. Lucas is trying to talk him out of it.<br /><br /> The main plot thread centers around the hospital for the criminally insane in St. Peter, Minnesota. Sandford renames it St. John's. When a serial killer scourges, murders, and displays a woman on a Minneapolis riverbank,  the detectives target garbageman Charlie Pope, a recently released sex addict from St. John's. Once again Lucas Tanner turns to psychologist and Roman Catholic nun, Sister Mary Joseph (Elle) for assistance. She compiles a profile of the killer, insisting that Charlie Pope isn't smart enough to be the killer.<br /><br /> Two weeks later, there's another victim, this time a man, also scourged, also put on display. Lucas and the other detectives interview the doctors, staff, and a trio of homicidal sex maniacs referred to as \\"The Gods Down the Hall.\\" The detectives think the trio may be \\"running\\" Charlie Pope from  inside St. John's. There is almost non-stop action, building to a climax inside the walls of St. John's.<br /><br /> Lucas Davenport has a cool quotient well into the stratosphere; when he's not driving his Porsche, he's racing his Lexus truck down the county roads around Mankota, taking on the killer face-to-face. When he's introduced to one of the female doctors at St. John's she's immediately drawn to him. But he's faithful to Weather, his plastic surgeon wife.<br /><br /> The Prey books are also liberally sprinkled with humor.

Neil Gaiman, Sandman: A Game of You (DC Comics, 1993)<br /><br />This fifth book in Gaiman's Sandman series takes us off on a side journey to a decidedly odd apartment house in New York City whose fate is inextricably tied to that of an outer island in the Dreaming. Lovely, innocent Barbie (who, of course, has an ex-boyfriend named Ken, because it's cute, and in Gaiman's world, \\"cute\\" is an inevitable precursor to destruction; it's almost on the same level as hubris in classical literature) and her best friend Wanda live in an apartment building with a pair of well-meaning lesbians, a youngish art history student who wears outrageously oversized glasses, and a reclusive type up on the top floor named George. All of them are in some way connected to the Dreaming, and the events of past books in the series, but how is only revealed to the reader in stages, so explaining it all would be quite spoilerific.<br /><br />A worthy addition to the series, though the two previous books were (slightly) better overall. ****	2005-10-11

Among the books he has written are such titles as 'The Complete Chess Course' and 'How Not to Play Chess'.  As Reinfeld states in his introduction, chess is in fact an easy game to learn, and an easy game to play for enjoyment, but like many things in life, there are hiearchies of ability that require practice, refinement, and knowledge.  Baseball is a simple game to learn, but one cannot expect to walk out onto a major league diamond after reading a few books on the subject and then purchasing a bat at the local sporting goods store (true, there are those very few who can, but for the rest of us, practice is what is required).<br /><br />Reinfeld has written this book with the beginner in mind.  Unlike many books that assume a good familiarity with the board, the pieces, and some basic kinds of strategy, this book by Reinfeld starts from scratch.  The first chapter looks in detail at the elements of the game - the pieces, the board, simple rules of movement, other rules of engagement, and how to read chess notation in books.<br /><br />Reinfeld goes through simple diagrams and strategies for what to do near the end of a game, dealing with few pieces on the board, and gradually increases the complexity of his discussion as the chapters progress.  He shows the elements of offensive and defensive tactics, and devotes a good amount of time opening play (single pawn king, single pawn queen, double pawn king, double pawn queen moves each get their own chapter, along with eccentric movements for openers, and some general strategies involved with each).<br /><br />Finally, Reinfeld has a chapter on illustrative games that employ many of the ideas he addresses earlier in the book.  Much like a textbook for chess, it draws its subject up point by point, and then introduces the full play of the games to the reader.  These games include many of the famous games of the first half of the twentieth century.<br /><br />This is a great book with which to start learning this game.br /> <br />This is a great book with which to start learning this game.   <br />	2005-10-11

By her second husband, Sir William Cavendish, she had five children, including William (who was created earl of Cavendish), Charles (whose son was created duke of Newcastle), Elizabeth (mother, by Charles Stuart, of Arabella Stuart, claimant to the throne who died in the Tower), and Mary (whose husband, a Talbot, inherited the earldom of Shrewsbury from Bess's fourth husband). This book follows the story of the younger William's descendants and Pearson does a good job of getting behind the state portraits and stately homes (including Chatsworth in Derbyshire) to the almost excessively human member of the family. The earls and dukes of Devonshire tended to marry well, including links to the Russells, Howards, Spencers, Butlers, Cecils, Fitzmaurices, Greys, and even the sister of President John F. Kennedy. The family also produced Charles Cavendish, a leading mathematician and close friend of Descartes, and, a century and a half later, Henry Cavendish, discoverer of hydrogen. Pearson does a very creditable job of recounting the history of a fascinating family.	2005-10-11

When I picked up this volume on the British Army in the Far East in 1941-45 and saw that Alan Jeffreys, a curator at the Imperial War Museum, had written it, I expected a first-class product. Alas, I was a bit disappointed by this volume due to the sparse coverage of the first two years of the war in Asia and the inadequate amount of detail on unit tables of organization and equipment (TOE). While the writing style and information that is presented are decent enough, it seems that the author only wanted to primarily focus on the last year of the war, i.e, the phase that the Commonwealth troops were winning. While one certainly does not expect an encyclopedic coverage in an Osprey title, this volume does not appear to present the type and amount of detail found in other Battle Orders titles (indeed, this seems more like an effort for the campaign series). Even the author's conclusion that the British adoption of a jungle warfare doctrine was a major element in reversing the Commonwealth's fortunes in South Asia seems to ignore the fact that US air and sea operations had virtually isolated the Japanese forces in the Burma-India theater from receiving further reinforcements after mid-1944.<br /><br /> The introductory section of this volume follows the series format, with a brief discussion of the combat mission of British forces in the Far East, which notes that the defense of the naval base at Singapore was the main operational focus. The section on training is lengthy, including noting that the British had one unit in Malaya - the 2nd Battalion Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders -that was fairly well trained in jungle warfare tactics. Unfortunately, the author's overly brief coverage of the Malayan campaign presents only a few tactical snippets of that unit's activities, making it difficult to assess what value this unit had. The section on division organization provides a short history of each British, Australian and Indian division in theater, but only a few of the line and block charts go below division level and none go below brigade level. Unlike other Osprey Battle Order volumes, there are almost no charts listing personnel or equipment holdings, except for one chart that shows artillery holdings across the four different types of Commonwealth divisions. Armored units - beyond a simple table listing numbers of tanks in theater in 1944 - are virtually absent from these pages. Given that Indian and Australian units often had non-standard TOEs, the author should have made greater effort to clarify unit structures - as is expected in this series.<br /><br />  The volume includes eleven 2-D maps: Japanese strategic plans in the Far East; Training sites in Southeast Asia; dispositions of Commonwealth forces in Malaya, December 1941; the Battle of Slim River; Commonwealth dispositions on Singapore; 1st Arakan campaign; the capture of Mandalay; the Japanese offensive at Imphal-Kohima; opening moves at Kohima; the British counterattack at Kohima; the British counteroffensive in June 1944. Unfortunately, the author does not provide anything like a theater order of battle for Commonwealth forces at any particular date, so trying to determine \\"the big picture\\" is futile with this volume. The author does provide a 2-page bibliography and a campaign chronology.<br /><br />  I was really stunned that this volume has virtually no mention of the 11,000 Commonwealth troops (6 battalions) lost at Hong Kong in December 1941 and no mention of the Commonwealth OB in Burma in December 1941. Nor is there any significant mention of British troops who fought in the Dutch East Indies (where I believe several thousand were captured) or China. Even the author's skimpy coverage of the forces available to Percival in Malaya is difficult to follow (must read division thumb-nail sketches). The First Arakan offensive in 1943 is also covered very briefly and the Chindits are almost ignored. It is clear that this author wanted to skirt quickly past this string of disasters and get to Imphal-Kohima, where he can recount the jocks of 2nd British Infantry Division giving the Japanese Army a sound thrashing. The author concludes his campaign narrative with General Slim's boast that his forces had given the Japanese \\"the biggest defeat in their whole history.\\" Given the catastrophic defeats suffered across the board by the Japanese after mid-1942, it seems rather a tad absurd to single out the defeat of only three of their divisions as \\"their greatest defeat ever.\\"<br /><br /> Readers attempting to digest the changes in the Commonwealth forces in the Far East between 1941-45 will find this volume of little help, since so little information is provided on the initial force structure. The author's labored dissection of the evolution of British jungle warfare doctrine, while perhaps illuminating for some readers, seemed tedious and with little point. The Commonwealth forces won at Kohima-Imphal because they had vastly superior firepower and were close to their base of supply, while the Japanese troops were virtually out of supply. Jungle warfare doctrine didn't help the Chindits much - essentially a waste of three infantry brigades - and Slim's victories in '44-45 were due more to combined arms tactics than any \\"jungle tactics.\\" Indeed, it was the ability of Commonwealth (and US C-47s, which the author ignores) logistic troops and engineers to build roads through jungles and over mountains and cross wide rivers that contributed most to victory in Burma.st this string of disasters and get to Imphal-Kohima, where he can recount the jocks of 2nd British Infantry Division giving the Japanese Army a sound thrashing.

An African-American, Conservative woman who has risen on her own talent becoming President would just be too potent an idea to resist. But a man with political experience on the bottom part of the ticket--say George Allen or Mitt Romney--and Condi would win by a landslide, changing the face of American politics forever and extending the Democrats' stay in the wilderness for many more years.	2005-10-11

As a book becomes more encyclopedic, it becomes less useful for pedagogy. Introduction to Graph Theory is somewhere in the middle. It is an adequate reference work and an adequate textbook. Steering a middle course, the book is bound to dissatisfy people with specific needs, but readers needing both a reference and a text will find the book satisfying.<br /><br />If you buy it for pedagogical purposes, be prepared to consult other works for a more intuitive approach. Introduction to Graph Theory presents few models, relying instead on logically rigorous development. Personally, I'm for both, but that takes up space, meaning less material can be covered.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought the book, and I will keep it for a future reference.	2005-10-11

He and Sue, his human mate, have been given new identities and relocated by the Sazi to Chicago.  There they are attempting to adjust to pack life.  Other than being furry once a month and craving red meat, Tony's adjustments include his newfound ability to see other people's memories by simply touching them.  The Sazi call this  \\"hindsight.\\"<br /><br />Tony's old Mafia boss, Carmine Leone, hires him to find his kidnapped lover Babs,  an Alpha werewolf.  According to Wolven Security Chief Lucas, she isn't the first Sazi female to be reported missing.  As if Carmine's demands aren't enough, the world leaders of the shapeshifter clans have converged on Chicago in order to train Tony in the use of his new \\"gift.\\"<br /><br />Sure, piece of cake!  He just has to find Babs, keep the pack leader from ripping his face off because Tony doesn't play well with others, and solve the mystery of the missing Sazi females....nothing to it!  All Tony really wants to do is grab Sue, find the closest secluded  horizontal surface and spend some quality time with his mate.  These pack problems are really getting to be a pain!<br /><br />Although Moon's Web starts out slowly,  it is an excellent continuation of the Sazi series.  It is a bit frustrating when the authors hinted at situations that occurred in the first book without giving full explanations. However, the heat between secondary characters Bobby and Asri keeps the story moving along at an even pace.  My imagination got quite a full workout with the eclectic mix of shapeshifters.  I wasn't certain how the authors could gather that mix into a cohesive law enforcement unit, but they did a wonderful job.  I highly recommend that you read Hunter's Moon first to avoid confusion of characters and plotlines. Oh, the villain of the story?  Well, read Moon's Web and be amazed!<br /><br />Monique<br /><br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	2005-10-11

I liked how they summarized the following scene at the beginning of the scene and had commentary on the scene at the end. The commentary is definitly helpful, although it could be a little bit more in depth in places. It is particularly helpful how they define terms in the margins that may be unfamiliar to readers. <br /> <br />Most of the information in the introduction/bio of Shakespere/etc. wasn't new to me and it seems pretty similar to the introduction in their other books, but it is still helpful for review and to readers who are unfamiliar with this information. <br /> <br />Definitly recommended.

I do not typically read historical fiction, being more of a mystery fan myself. However, I recently read Philippa Gregory's \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and enjoyed it, and my interest was piqued enough to seach out other books about Henry VIII. I came across George's book quite by accident in a bookstore one day, and decided to purchase it, vaguely remembering that it got good reviews on Amazon. I'm certainly glad I did! <br /> <br />George's \\"The Autobiography of Henry VIII : With Notes by His Fool, Will Somers\\" is an amazing book. It's quite daunting to look at (being more than 900 pages long!) but I can assure you that, once started, you will fly through this book. As the title implies, this book is from Henry's point of view, and it is written as a journal.  <br /> <br />In the opening pages we hear from Henry's fool Will, who is writing to Henry's illegitimate daughter Catherine (Anne Boleyn's sister Mary is the mother). Will explains that he is sending her Henry's journal, a journal that he, Will, found after Henry's death. He admits that he has read through it and added notes of his own in some sections, which is George's clever way of adding a more objective opinion to some of \\"Henry's\\" ramblings.  <br /> <br />This book presents a fascinating, and markedly different, view of Henry than is usually presented in history books. Instead of seeing Henry VII as a mean, vindictive, overweight slob, he comes across as a mostly kind man who is haunted by inner demons (especially near the end of his life).  <br /> <br />If you're at all interested in Henry VII (and even if you're not!), I strongly urge you to pick up this book.	2005-10-11

I've read interviews with Gilmore who makes no claims of being an \\"historian\\" or a \\"journalist\\" and says he leaves that for the \\"academic\\" boys.  He speaks to us from the gut in LIVE FAST, DIE YOUNG, as he does in his other books, and this body of work has made him a \\"counter-culture\\" hero or icon; a REBEL in the literary field as Dean was a rebel in the acting field. In LIVE FAST, DIE YOUNG, Dean calls Gilmore a Rimbaud character (the French poet, Arthur Rimbaud, one of the most proclaimed rebels of all time).  LIVE FAST, DIE YOUNG is often hard to take due to the nature or undercurrent of emotional torque present in this author's works.  Not just a sit-and-read writer, if allowed into your head, Gilmore can possibly change perspectives.  An example: his book L.A. DESPAIR puts you through an emotional wringer, and this book on James Dean is solid impact.  A fearless work, a DIFFERENT kind of book, but controversial.	2005-10-11

The story focuses on Kisho Nova Cat, a mystic that was introduced in \\"Sword of Sedition\\".  After throwing \\"Daughter of the Dragon\\" in the trash, where it belonged, this book was a pleasant surprise to me.  The author goes a little overboard on the inner turmoil content, pushing Kisho's behavior slightly beyond believable.  However, the story and action provided enough of a foundation to keep my interest.  Although not blatantly pornographic, like \\"Daughter\\", there is one subtle sex scene that spans chapter 7, so parents, be forewarned.  The author aparently also has permission to kill off a couple well-known characters from the MechWarrior miniatures universe.  I was very dissapointed in the pointless way they were eliminated.  I'm worriedly holding out hope that WizKids and their authors will reveal some actual purpose for these executions, other than to just eliminate factions in their game.   <br />This book does a nice job of illustrating the nobility and pride of the Nova and Spirit Cats, while also exposing the conflicting nature of their eugenics program; the brutally harsh system that the Nova Cats have swathed in a semi-religious belief system.  Although not as good as Loren Coleman's books, or \\"Target of Opportunity\\", this is a good read, especially for those interested in the status of the Nova Cats and Spirit Cats.	2005-10-11

The pace picks up in this book.  This book adds more character development to Rapp and it does it in full, fast-paced form.  Rahn's character is dynamic enough to bring home the point that these assassins have what they do for a living, and that is about it.  I am glad Flynn decided not to expound greatly on the interactions between her and Rapp, there was just enough to bring her into the story.  The book starts off fast with Mitch on an operation in Germany...when things go wrong, Mitch goes looking for the reasons.  Assassins are all over the place in this one, and multiple government agencies are involved in an intricate plot.  Pull in Saddham Hussein, and you have one heck of a story.  The behind the scenes politician babble that Flynn provides is top notch.  It makes you start to look at your Senators and Representatives in different ways.  Try figuring out who might be like the characters in this novel.  I really liked this one, but reading the Third Option first is a must.	2005-10-11

The daughters, Michelle and Annie are very different. At twenty-one, Michelle is already treading a career path, a serious and directed young woman who has traveled to Spain to expand her career options. The slightly younger Annie is an idealist, like her father, participating fully in the world around her with joyful laughter. Through their years of sisterly competition, Michelle cruelly tells Annie that she is the backup sister, in case anything ever happens to the golden child, the first daughter. Only in Spain for a month, Michelle becomes an accidental victim of a terrorist bombing by Basque separatists, her young life extinguished in a manner that sunders her family in America, leaving Annie and her parent's, whose marriage cannot survive the tragedy, to come to terms with this cruel legacy.<br /><br />Almost three years later, Ben Williamson hovers near Annie's campus as if to protect his remaining daughter. After obsessively researching the country where his daughter lost her life, Ben travels to Spain, to the scene of Michelle's death. Ben experiences a series of emotional shifts while in Spain, absorbing all around him, inching around the edges of his unbearable despair and growing rage, in a futile endeavor to make sense of his daughter's death: \\"As all tourists finally must, he becomes a tourist of himself.\\" While wandering near the scene of the explosion, Ben has the good fortune to meet the divorced Paula Ortiz, a sensible and sensitive woman who is drawn to Williamson, but intuits the depth of his unresolved feelings. After a short time together, Ben disappears and Paula is frantic with unarticulated fears.<br /><br />Annie is the other half of this story, the lens through which the author discloses Williamson as father and man, the unwitting beneficiary of a devoted daughter with a finely tuned sensitivity to her father's pain and loneliness. Struggling to accept Michelle's loss, the continued rivalry between the sisters, one alive, one dead, still exists in Annie's mind, a stubborn resentment of the favored daughter. Annie thoughtfully assesses where this continued self-indulgence has gotten her. Impulsively arriving in Spain with an increasing sense of urgency, Annie meets Paula with an assurance that astonishes the older woman, for this girl can feel her father's nearness and the dark emotional terrain that consumes him.<br /><br />The psychological weight of the Williamson's loss is perfectly balanced with the ambiguities of Spanish culture, the small, thoughtful details of everyday life in stark relief to the outbursts of passion, the careful tenderness until the next outburst. The protagonists blindly enter the heart of Basque territory, infiltrated by an angry father who wants another in exchange for his daughter, a landscape of repression, torture and terrorism. In deeply compassionate prose tuned to the subtleties of an exotic culture, the author inserts the conflicted Ben into a world so unlike his own, where historical passions run deep and frequently violent. This extraordinary pilgrimage of one man's broken heart in search of consolation is a moving portrait of loss and personal redemption.

Maps of Egypt, the Ptolemaic and Roman Empire, the Greek and Roman Provinces in Egypt, and important cities and trade routes are included, and are extremely helpful and important.

Only one book, \\"Little, Big,\\" has ever been a modestly big seller.  His \\"Aegypt\\" tetrology, not yet complete, is a piece of visionary work on an epic scale.  His only fault is that the writing is unclassifiable, so it has fallen between every conceivable crack.  Bad for sales.    \\"Engine Summer\\" is the first of his novels, though the last of the early three to be published.  It leaves the others behind as a work of astonishing originality and almost hallucinogenic vision. (Crowley admits that his first draft was written at a time when he was smoking a lot of, well, you know.)  In this elegant and beautifully understated work (if it goes a little slowly at first, stick with it: it will sweep you away) the Crowley themes have a true beginning:  a world constantly transforming in which the only way that the history of the human as the strangest of races can really be kept alive is through the stories we tell.    He has an enormous talent for inducing laughter of utter delight and rolling tears simultaneously.  His gift is in his humanity, his innate understanding of the deep pathos and utter ridiculousness of being self-conscious creatures in a world that is not and will never be wholly comprehensible.  Thus it is our stories that keep us sane. Barely.    The future which he envisions (this is not the kind of future fantasy that even pretends to forsee the world as it might actually turn out) is one in which the split between the natural, instinctual half of our human dichotomy and the mental, synthetic one actually become separate species, with no real capacity to comprehend each the other.  How this plays out through his richly detailed imagination and alchemical control of the Engish language is something to be experienced, not described.  The narrative device, which leaves us guessing until a breathtaking revelation at the end, is alone, worth the price.    Get this book.  Read it.  Please.  The later Crowley may be greater, but never more brilliantly imagined than this.    Oh, yeah.  \\"Beasts\\" and \\"The Deep\\" are mighty fine, too.	2005-10-11

Throughout the book Eric describes the challenges he and his wife faced during their time away from the \\"modern conveniences\\" most people take for granted.  Anyone interested in exploring alternatives to consumerism and materialistic culture should check out this book.	2005-10-11

Written to be accessible to lay readers and non-mathematicians, The Pea And The Sun outlines the history of the paradox, introduces readers to the basics of such matters as set theory, isometrics, scissors congruence and equidecomposability, and walks the reader through the theorem and proof that object duplication is indeed mathematically possible. But just because it is mathematically possible, is it physically possible? The highly counterintuitive nature of the mathematical theorem demands a critical response. A final chapter dwells on speculation as to how the Banach-Tarski Paradox may apply to the modern and future world. Written in a fresh, captivating, friendly style, The Pea And The Sun is remarkably engaging and will appeal to any reader with a discerning, inquisitive mind into the nature of the so-called impossible, regardless of their particular mathematical background.	2005-10-11

As his shop was a destination, just for the cheesecake, it was a no brainer to buy the book.  I spent several months working my way through all the baked and baked-flavored cheesecakes and can attest to the quality of all the recipes.  My favorite recipe is 'The Heavy One' followed by the pumpkin cheesecake. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book, especially if you have something like a Kitchen-Aid stand mixer to beat the cream cheese with.  Buy it, you won't be sorry.	2005-10-11

This incident lasts for 100 pages as Kafka describes the moments and thoughts going through the poor mutated man's mind. Certainly a psychological horror classic and can be read in the space of a few lunch hours. Not a bad place to start with Kafka.	2005-10-11

There are hundreds of photographs, black & white and colour, many covering a full 20cm x 25cm page, or even two of them. There are plenty of shots of Hitchcock in the middle of direction, standing by an actor or beside a camera, waving his arms about or pulling a face. It is interesting to see the early Hollywood sets and dollies, the kind used by Orson Wells to the new wave 70s helicopter rigs flying alongside the river Themes. It is not the kind of book that we are supposed to read from back to back, but is there for our amusement as a coffee table picture book and certainly a fine reference manual for any film making enthusiast. I highly recommend it to complement a Hitchcock DVD film collection. I often turn the pages to reference a film I have just watched to see some of the set design. It also covers some interesting topics like where and when Hitchcock appears in his movies with still-frames for orientation. The binding is high quality. There is tons of stuff on framing and lighting including the dynamics of camera elevation. Each image is something to be deeply considered. I can not see a film maker go wrong using these images as a director's template. It is a bit of imaging bible in that respect.	2005-10-11

David Needham is one of the most passionate teachers I've ever seen.  When I read his book for the first time it turned a 180 in my Christian life.  I realized how many of Satan's lies I'd been kept under, even in my Christian life.  This book has impacted my life and relationship with God more than I can possibly say.

I voted for Kerry and I just can't accept that I was wrong. I am not mentally or emotionally stable enough to accept that the guy I voted for was the wrong man for the wrong job at the wrong time. I voted for John Kerry and I just can't accept that all of things the pro democrat media machine  said to hype Kerry was, well, just hype and even so, didn't work to seal the deal for Kerry so he could win.    I voted for the guy that lost. I can't accept that. I know that Kerry is a loser. I know that he spent 20+ years in the senate and didn't do a thing. In all of those 20+ years he missed nearly every meeting and every vote and only made 5 stupid proposals which nobody took seriously and never got off the table. Yeah I know the taxpayers paid this guy $140,000/year to do absolutely nothing, but so what? They paid Bill Clinton much more than that for 8 years to do nothing.     I know that Kerry filled out the applications for his fake Purple Hearts. But so what? I wanted to believe that he is a hero. Why burst my balloon even if it's not true. So what if real heroes were denied Purple Hearts and awards? Kerry should come first.     I know that the silver star should have never been granted to Kerry, in fact he should have been tried for murder. But so what? Everybody lies and those people he killed, I didn't know them. So what if they were unarmed and defenseless? So what if he killed animals and people in the manner of Kenghis Khan? They weren't my relatives or my animals. Who cares?    So what if Kerry lied in that speech in Washington, D.C. back in '71 and so what if American POW's were tortured due to Kerry's allegations? So what if many of our loved ones are still MIA because of Kerry. So what if many of us were left orphans and widows all because of Kerry. John Kerry wanted to run for president. He planned it over 35 years ago. Why spoil his dream all because of incidentals?     So that is why I write these condescending reviews with names like Brenda Jr., Lisa Jr., Loyd, Heather, Avid Reader, Wedgie and so on. John Kerry is my hero. I want to lie, cheat and steal too. Maybe I'll run for office someday too. I'll just follow John Kerry's example. Lie like hell and get suckers to believe me. It nearly worked for him. And it was even closer for Al Gore. And it did work for Slick Willy. So you never know.    So these are the reasons for my stupid, incessant, cocky and condescending while totally worthless and false reviews that I write to defend John Kerry. Besides, there is a 1% chance that John  Kerry may become the #11 democrat out of 11 democrats to run for president in 2008 on the democrat ticket. So I have to hype this guy all I can.    Hope you understand.    Oh, and I only use Heinz ketchep too.    Now watch for my review by Avid Reader \\"A actual review (not really. I never read this book) of the book\\" coming up next. I love to change names and besides all of that, I have no life. All I do is sit in front of my pc all day long and write reviews. I already wrote 268 reviews since August and by voting for myself got into the top 500 reviewers category. You see, I have never won any real awards in my life so it makes me feel special.	2005-10-11

US	51167656	R3POETX6Q9CF56	0974039446	447896798	Fear: A Ghost Hunter's Story	Books	5	23	24	N	N	A Masterpiece	Most books of this type, including the very best of the genre, are for the most part second hand accounts of ghostly encounters. In other words, the author has interviewed people who have had a run in with a ghost and the author then relates the story in book form. On occasion one will run into a book that was written by a person who had been closely involved with the haunt in question but even then the author usually just happened to move into the wrong house. Kriss Stephens on the other hand, actively hunts ghosts and has taken her team to some of the most haunted places in the world. The only other author of ghost books that I have run into who does this is Hans Holzer who is considered by many to be the foremost authority in this field. Dr. Holzer however comes nowhere near Ms. Stephens when it comes to contagious enthusiasm for the subject at hand. While reading this book one can just feel the enthusiasm and excitement bursting off of the page and it is hard not to get caught up in the author's excitement.<br /><br />It turns out that Stephens grew up in a haunted house and it seems that she has been chasing ghosts ever since. Working with several TV shows including MTV's \\"Fear\\" has allowed her the opportunity to travel extensively in search of her elusive prey and has given her access to areas that most people will never see. She seems to be quite fearless in the pursuit of her goal as she wanders around in places that most people, myself included, would fear to tread. In the process she has encountered numerous entities and has even been physically attacked on occasion, including a pair of scratches that are shown in a photograph.<br /><br />The photographs are another thing that makes this book so spectacular. There is page after page of photos taken at the sites being investigated and many show a large number of anomalies that just shouldn't be there. Even the pictures that are quite normal help to add to the ever so creepy atmosphere of this book. I do wish that she had managed to get a shot of Old Green Eyes at Chickamauga however because I have always wondered just what he looks like. But alas, even this author wasn't brave enough to take on this green-eyed monster. I would also be remiss if I didn't mention this book's modern take on the Bell Witch which provided a very refreshing look at the possible modern day activities of this most famous of hauntings.<br /><br />There were only a couple of things that I would like to see change in future editions of this book, the first being a good editing to remove several typos. I would also like to see something along the lines of a cast list because it is sometimes hard to keep up with all of the author's ghost hunting friends. Finally, a small caption under some of the pictures in which the anomaly is hard to see might help out some of us with old and weak eyes. If these minor problems are addressed this book will in my opinion belong in the top five percent of all ghost books ever written.o wish that she had managed to get a shot of Old Green Eyes at Chickamauga however because I have always wondered just what he looks like.

This book fits in nicely between reference works like Eric Meyers \\"Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide\\" and technique books like Dan Cederholm's \\"Bulletproof Web Design\\". At first glance, this rather unassuming book contains pretty basic information about the applications of CSS. However, this book deserves a careful reading, as it is packed with excellent explanations and examples. <br /> <br />\\"Cascading Style Sheets\\" isn't full of flashy illustrations, but the examples are well thought out and present the ideas well. The chapter on layout (\\"Boxes, Boxes, Boxes\\") contains the best explanation I have seen on how layout boxes function in CSS. If you've been wrestling with understanding the difference between absolute and relative positioning, and how to use these values to make stable layouts, this book is for you. <br /> <br />The chapter on typography is an excellent resource for developers who may not have had the chance to study this essential subject. The authors present theory and application of good typographic practice (which is often ignored in current web design). <br /> <br />The chapter on browser bugs (\\"Cross-browser CSS\\") summarizes the current knowledge on cross-browser compatibility very well, and provides rock-solid workarounds for those thorny problems. <br /> <br />Last but not the least, the chapter \\"CSS Design Projects\\" will give you some solid examples to apply to your own designs. <br /> <br />There's quite a few good books out there right now on CSS, and quite a few not-so-good books; how is one to choose? Well, this book should be at the top of your shopping list--it's a rich, detailed, and extremely well-written book about the subtle craft of web design with CSS.	2005-10-11
US	49694646	R32HSCDGNZOU53	0156004801	475362106	All the King's Men	Books	5	5	5	N	Y	The best book of the 20th century....	This is the only book in my life I've read four times and each time is an experience that brings new insights and relevations.  I first read this book in high school and I come back to every three years so becuase its just that good.  Warren won the Pullitzer Prize in 1946 for this and I argue its the classic of the century and possibly the best American novel ever writte.  Reading this book is like drinking a fine wine...it needs to be sniffed, sipped and swirled to appreciated although I promise you won't want to spit this out! <br /> <br />Like all amazing pieces of work, this book has many different aspects to it.  The story revolves around a southern Governor and his right hand man who narrates the story.  The first time I read the book, I knew nothing about the plot or the historical undercurrents and I think this is the best way to read as it the best way absorb the beautiful prose.  Warren turns simple situations like the sound of rain beating down on an automobile into eloquent rythmical expressions that fuse you onto the page.  The book is also a coming of age story and Warren is able to capture and relate to the human psyche so well that I've thought I'm reading excerpts from my own life.  The relationships Jack Burden has with his boss, his father, his best friend, and his best friend's sister will surely ring true with many a reader.  Warren does an amazing job developing these relationships in realistic and heartbreaking ways.  I love how each chapter stands alone as it's own mini story. <br /> <br />There is so much to be said about this book and there is reason why so many other viewers give this book such high praise.  For novice readers this won't be an easy read as it exremely involving and some of the sub-plots are hard to follow.  I think more experienced readers won't be able to put it down.  For people looking to try some classic literature, this is a fantastic place to start.  Enganging enough for the advanced high school student, this wouldbe an excellent present for the teenager leaving home for college beacuse of the thematic relevancy. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  For me it is the standard all other classics are measured against.	2005-10-11

Blum's book provided far more practical advice relating to my project and was the one I consistently returned to for reference. I had an issue not addressed directly in the book, did a Google search on it and found the answer...by the book's author in an online discussion forum!  <br /> <br />In short, it is virtually impossible to find a book that addresses every last real-world gotcha inherent in starting any new project with a new language and class library as vast as .NET's, but if you have a C# sockets project to do then I can't recommend another book more than this one.	2005-10-11

She focuses on meals in the life and parables of Jesus, which in many ways tell more than the Last Supper story does about what our mission should be. <br /> <br />The chapter on meals covers 19 scripture passages including the wedding feast at Cana, dinner with the Pharisees and, of course, the feeding of the 5000. We see here an explicit reference to small-e eucharist as Winter points out that the emphasis is satisfying physical hunger. \\"That was a priority for Jesus. It is a priority now.\\" <br /> <br />Her reflection on the parable of the wise and foolish wedding attendants (Mt 25:1-12) is a good example of applying unconventional wisdom to an old story. The traditional interpretation, that storing up good works gains the approval of the heavenly gatekeeper, whom we assume to be Jesus, is problematic for some. For starters, the wise may be seen as \\"eating and drinking and being merry while the poor are kept outside.\\" And Jesus would never have barred the door, writes Winter. She also suggests that the \\"foolish\\" attendants may have been sensible, hardworking, and resourceful. They did bring some oil, perhaps as much as they could afford, though not enough to see them through the delay. And they went out in the middle of the night and managed to return with lighted lamps; yet they were barred. She closes with the notion that it would be just like Jesus to have told the story in reverse.	2005-10-11

It's been tough but he's finally there, and he has a great job lined up with a respected local firm.  One of his last classes is legal issues for the aged and infirm, and part of it involves giving free legal help.  It is here that he meets Dot Black, who has a medical insurance policy covering her family.  Her son, Donny Ray, was diagnosed with leukemia, but the company has refused to cover a bone marrow transplant.  Things appear to favor the Blacks, and Rudy has his first client.  And it's a good thing because due to a merger he suddenly finds he no longer has the great job he'd been promised, and ends up working for the sleaziest lawyer in town with a bunch of ambulance chasers.  He's broke and it just gets tougher from there.<br /><br />A very exciting story and full of legal drama.  Plus, being told from Rudy's perspective allows for a very funny sense of sarcasm to come across.  A number of side stories keep it from becoming boring, and keep you guessing what's coming next, even though not everything is tied up all neat and tidy.  And there was a twist at the end that I found especially interesting, but still very satisfying (my book had about 15 blank pages at the end so it kinda fooled me into thinking the end wasn't as near as it really was).	2005-10-11

But I have only read 100 pages of \\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes\\" and I am appalled.  I am not even sure I want to finish it and risk tarnishing my affection for all of Ms. Gabaldon's other tales.  SPOILERS ahead (though minor).<br /><br />What I find most disturbing is the crassness of the narrative and the apparant disregard for the history of the characters.<br /><br />SPOILERS:  The scene where Roger forces (albeit drunkenly) himself on Brianna - with Jem nestled sleeping at her side - and Brianna's response to it was astonishing.  Did \\"The Fiery Cross\\" not devote HUNDREDS of pages detailing the deep-seated emotional scars left by Stephen Bonnet's rape of Brianna????? Is this the same Roger who before always sensitively and tenderly restrained his lust in respect of her scars? Does this not matter to Roger anymore?  Does it no longer bother Brianna?  If so... HOW? WHY?  WHAT HAPPENED?<br /><br />And the late-night visit of the Cherokee girls to Jamie while he and Ian were visiting... Ian's amusement struck me as improbable, as did (devoutly Catholic and deeply committed)Jamie's decision to allow the naked girls to sleep with him.  Would Claire have been amused by this as well?  I don't think so.<br /><br />I assure you that I am no prude but it seems to me that in \\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes\\" Ms. Gabaldon has abandoned romance and passion for light porn; traded clever and seamless integration of historical events, time-travel and a truly remarkable fictional romance for crass dialogue and indifferent adventures; and worst of all... forsaken the integrity of the characters - as well as her own painstaking and tender work in building those characters - for sensationalistic filler material.<br /><br />On the other hand I have long dreaded the conclusion of this series and the necessity of saying goodbye to so many beloved characters...

Smith's Arkady Renko is considered the archetype for this type of foreign police detective and if you've read Gorky Park you will see similarities with Bangkok 8. Both stories take you inside a foreign culture and show you a side of law enforcement most Americans never see. Both stories also provide an interesting view of American culture as seen by an outsider. <br /> <br />As with many good books, what works in Bangkok 8 highlights what doesn't. At times it is evident Burdette isn't showing us the thoughts and feelings of Thai people as much as he's giving us his interpretation of these thoughts and feelings. Also, the American characters are portrayed as one-dimensional. I know part of this is the point, Americans seem dull to the Thai, but I think he could have developed the female FBI Agent who works with Sonchai a little better. She has the hots for him and immediately abandons western logic to adopt his eastern intuitive style of investigation. I think a more realistic approach would be for both of them to make contributions to the investigation based on the strengths of the systems they employ.  <br /> <br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and will look forward to reading it's sequel within the next year. <br />	2005-10-11

Seems to be good in comparison to others I've read.  OF course, the question of them teaching concepts that don't work in IE has been raised to the level of an \\"issue.\\"  One positive I can see in them discussing techniques that don't work in IE6 is that the authors expect IE7 to be more in line with browsers like Mozilla.<br /><br />If this book leaves me with anything, it will be the fact that standards compliance is a fight being fought by many of the leading designers - not just the authors (see Jeremy Keith, Dave Shea, and of course, [...]  That gives me reason to open my ears and read about why they find it important.

Many thousands of lives could have been saved if vitamin C had been readily available as it is now.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the power of vitamin C to fight influenza is still not acknowledged by the orthodox medical establishment, even though numerous published scientific studies have shown vitamin C, at adequate doses, to be very powerful at killing viruses and, thus, protecting us from their ill effects. One reason for this misunderstanding is that the orthodox medical establishment considers only about 90 mg of vitamin C daily to be needed by humans, and this dosage will not fight influenza. However, the actual dosage of vitamin C most humans need is at least 2,000 mg each day under normal conditions and much higher amounts when an infection starts to occur.  <br /> <br />For those who are willing to consider the benefits of vitamin C and other nutrients in fighting illness, I recommend the book How to Feel Better and Live Longer by Dr. Linus Pauling, the only person to have won two unshared Nobel Prizes.	2005-10-11

His gift is to capture the complicated in a simple way, describe the complex in understandable terms, lighten the onerous with humor and unmask the obvious truths in the obfuscations of the so-called \\"experts\\". David understands that education is a personal and often private matter, which can't properly be accomplished with the interference of other people's agendas (no matter how well meaning or professionally vetted), standardized tests, grading and all the other managerial tools foisted on kids in the name of systematized education. So he eloquently describes a better way. The essays in Have Fun. Learn Stuff. Grow. communicate the essence of how parents can lovingly nurture their children in life and in learning, and that is to recognize them for whom they are and to take them seriously. Feel able to do that, and you and your children are well equipped to embark on the adventure of education without school.	2005-10-11

This remarkable novel gets off to a rough start as 14-year-old Susie Salmon's neighbor man, George Harvey, brutally rapes and murders her, and to our dismay, gets away with it.  From Heaven, Susie narrates the entire book as she watches her family (parents and two siblings) shatter into pieces while slowly tracking their lives as well as those of several friends over the next 15 years or so.  The writing is vivid and emotional, and many a reader will shed tears along the way as the family grieves their way into breakdown.<br /><br />We thought the first half of the story a little better than the second.  Sebold did a fine job revealing the frustration and suffering of the family members, and how in turn they each coped differently.  What happened to some of Susie's friends was also entertaining, as they \\"came of age\\" in various ways.  During the latter half, we were a little disappointed that the story bogged down - and despite various buildups, several opportunities to identify and catch the killer, find the poor girl's body, and give all the characters some ultimate satisfaction were passed over by the author, leaving us somewhat unsettled as well.  Moreover, an unusual love scene near the conclusion seemed really wrong and out of place, somewhat destroying the \\"magic\\" of the heavenly narration by an out of context earthly event.  And we weren't sure that the family reunion at the end was as likely as portrayed.<br /><br />But - a 2300-reviewer 4-star rating can't be all wrong.  Many a provocative scene depicts the good and bad of life, and rarely have we seen a novel so delicately interweave both hope and despair.  The author's perception (or at least creative expression) of what Heaven is like is certainly different and less utopian than typical.  Maybe that people seem to want to talk about \\"Lovely Bones\\" long after putting it down may be the best recommendation of all!	2005-10-11

These people may be searching for love, for glory, for release, a burst of adrenaline in the desert, or for just a fling by the beach -- however, their problems and pasts will not go away.<br /><br />Eggers does occasionally dip into gimmickry, such as \\"There Are Some Things He Should Keep to Himself.\\" Don't expect much -- it's a few blank pages, which made me smile. But I feel a little cheated. He's at his best when he's unconsciously quirky, such as a cute conversation between God and the ocean in one short story.<br /><br />Eggers has done well in his past novel and memoir, but some of the themes of \\"How We Are Hungry\\" feel worn -- this man has a unique writing talent, but writers have to grow, and this writing doesn't show his mind or soul growing. The themes have not changed, and that lack of movement and growth makes it feel like he's just... stuck.<br /><br />That said, Eggers' writing is genuinely compelling and rich; in his rambly way, he's incredibly eloquent. His descriptions have a raw energy that can take your breath away, such as riding a horse in the desert. At the same time, he can wrap his characters in so much finely-drawn misery that it is difficult to not be moved by them. It's also the one area where Eggers stumbles -- despite the whimsy of the occasional \\"gimmick\\" story, the writing is dark and rather depressed. I'm not asking for sunshine and butterflies, but it lacks quips, wit and human insight.<br /><br />Those characters tend to feel like reflections of Eggers himself -- rather world-wear and melancholy. One woman, who climbs a legendary mountain in search of a purpose, is perhaps the richest character -- her inner thoughts are so real that they fly off the page. And she, like all the other characters, is hungry. Not for food, but to fill some emptiness inside that can't be named.<br /><br />Perhaps it's that inner hole that preoccupies Eggers' work, and the endless search is what keeps it from exploring the world. Despite a hint of stagnation, \\"How We Are Hungry\\" is a rich and engaging collection of stories. It leaves me wondering where -- if anywhere -- Eggers will go as a writer.like reflections of Eggers himself -- rather world-wear and melancholy.

Culture Clash is the fourth in a series of dog/training books that I ordered from amazon (fourth to Patricia McConnell's Other end of the leash; The Dog Whisperer (not Cesar Millan); and Ian Dunbar's Teach an new dog old tricks and I have to say I am glad that I waited to read this one.<br /><br />On the positive side: She drives home the point that dogs are not human (not furry humans, not babies, not spiteful)--this is perhaps the number one concept that gets us \\"melon-brains\\", into trouble when bringing home a new pup or as she refers to them, the \\"lemon-brains.\\" We forget that those big beautiful canines are their defense mechanism and that they will use them when necessary.<br /><br />On the negative side: She drives this point in such a arrogant, self-righteous tone that it's annoying to read (as if she wasn't a melon-brained monkey herself). I find myself skipping over the redundant ranting to get to the fleshy ideas she has to offer. For someone who stresses \\"positive\\" \\"humane\\" and \\"gentle\\" training her words and how they are organized leave me feeling like my choke chain has been pulled and yanked (sometimes i feel like I swallowed broken glass).<br /><br />On the positive side: Gives some ideas and techniques that are gentle and focus on positive reinforcement.<br /><br />On the negative side: You have to dig into the text and into the chapters (well into chapter 5 and 6) to find them. also the only set of pictures is at the back but they were of no use to me. its not the typical how to book.<br /><br />Patricia McConnell (animal behaviorist) in her book Other End of the Leash, really delves (in a well written and organized manner) into the research and gives concrete examples of research that supports her argument (same \\"dogs aren't human--so don't treat them as human\\" concept)and is so human and humane and truly witty. The data really builds McConnell's credibility as a behaviorist. McConnell calls us humans \\"monkeys.\\"<br /><br />Donaldson calls us humans \\"melon-brains.\\" It seems like Donaldson's book is just a book of opinions w/little research data to support it. I'm reading chapters 5 and 6 but in retrospect, I cannot recall scientific data to support her argument.<br /><br />I don't find Culture Clash by Jean Donaldson \\"witty\\" at all. Donaldson attempts a \\"what if\\" scenario by putting the humans in the dogs' place where the humans depended on these creatures called Grons (not unlike dogs depend on us humans). She goes on to question, how would you feel if all those natural behaviors, such as smiling, using the toilet, reading the newspaper were behaviors that the Grons didn't approve of (not unlike humans don't approve of chewing, excessive barking, and soiling the carpet). After a LOOOOONG and drawn out description of problem behaviors that lead to aggression (not unlike that found in a frustrated, confused, and under-socialized dog), the story ends sadly with the human being taken to Donaldson's version of the \\"shelter\\" to be euthanized because of such aggression.<br /><br />I found the story stupid and drawn out to make a simple point: communication and training with a dog (while isn't not rocket science)it takes time, effort, and responsibility on the part of the owner. I wish she would get to the point (for a melon-brained money, i'm thinking a lot more simply, like a dog).<br /><br />That's concept is what this book is supposed to be about: dogs don't think in such a complicated manner. Dogs close the gap between themselves and piece of food, they don't calculate calories. Dog increase the gap between themselves and a scary person/object/situation they don't analyze it to death.<br /><br />Having said that: Good concept and idea--bad, BAD, BAD presentation.he data really builds McConnell's credibility as a behaviorist.

It was difficult to put down.  The author, on account of her family connections, obviously had a passion for telling this story and that passion came through in the pages of this book.  The thing I appreciated most about the book--aside from its riveting subject matter--was that the author presented a very balanced and objective account of the tragedy.  She did not try to blame the mining company, the mine bosses, the cage operators or the politicians for the tragedy.  I did not sense any underlying agenda except to tell the story of these men and their families.  That was refreshing.  She actually seemed somewhat sympathetic to all involved and seemed to give them all the benefit of the doubt.  Again, very refreshing.  The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is because--for reasons that I cannot put my finger on--I was not quite as impressed with this book as I was two other disaster accounts I have read recently, Dark Tide (Great Molasses Flood in Boston) and Ship Ablaze (General Slocum disaster in East River), both of which I rated 5 stars (and highly recommend).	2005-10-11

To start at the beginning, The front cover sould use a bit of sprucing up.  Looking at the book cover would not have drawn me to it if I had seen in at a store rather than on Amazon. <br />     The book itself, well I feel as tho I spent 2.99 to buy what amounts to a glorified outline or first try at a story that has no mystery or advnture to it, especially to those of us who have enjoyed previous antics of the 'sisters'.  Since I enjoy the author's works, I have to assume tht either her editor or publisher planned this piece of a story. We know from the beginning how the story will end. We do not see much action from the sisters. it is interesting how a whole section is left out;that being the obvious healing of the young man by one of the sisters conviently out of town. I suppose she will make it home in time to heal the patient when her turn comes to have a book. <br />     There are so many openings for adventure and magic that are left untouched.

Sadly	The Rizzoli Contract is described as a literary thriller- literary both because it focuses deeply on what is taking place within Harry Donohue (its main character) and because the contract of the title is a book contract- not the contract put out on someone's life (as I had assumed, going in.)<br /><br />A good read? Yeah. But it would have been jazzed up by more hit men. More rocket launchers. And spaghetti sauce.<br /><br />Plot summary: a fifty-something Bostonian, failing to safeguard the family business which his siblings have entrusted to him, casts all his wits and strength into a make-or-break gamble. Can he turn Rizzoli's story into a bestseller that will revive the fortunes of Donohue Press? Can he keep his grubby old-man mitts of of Rizzoli's wife? Can he make amends with his own family, especially his estranged son? Over the course of 330 pages, all is revealed.<br /><br />The real appeal of the book is its portraits of Boston, the 80's, and Harry. (Get your reading glasses checked if you can't see the plot twist coming a mile away). There are some fantastic descriptions, and the spirit of that place in time is captured with complete authority. This is honest. It's the real deal.<br /><br />It's just that real life is the thing that foolish young dudes like me pick up books to escape.<br /><br />Three and a half stars outta five, and another anecdote in evidence that ex-pat eyes capture with amazing clarity their native country.	2005-10-11

Books	4	4	6	N	N	A hilarious indictment of the geek's sacred cow	Unix, and to some extent, its offspring Linux have always been something I've hated, and it was very refreshing to come across a book that summed up all my frustrations perfectly. In the Unix Haters Handbook, Daniel Weise and Simson Garfinkel take aim at your average geek's most sacred cows, from Unix to Usenet to the C programming language, and the result is nothing short of hilarious.<br /><br />The first portion of the book is dedicated to exposing the basic flaws of the Unix operating system, decrying the \\"Worse is Better\\" philosophy that it is built on. The crude, antidiluvian console interface, the utter lack of documentation, the hopeless X-Windowing system, nothing is spared from the book's wrath. The latter is devoted to exploring the flawed peripherals of Unix, from sendmail, to the troublesome system administration and file systems. Lastly, the C programming language is also thoroughly lambasted, undoubtedly earning the ire of geeks everywhere.<br /><br />The authors present their frustrations in a humorous and tongue-in-cheek manner, sprinkling anecdotes from other users fed up with Unix as well. But at it's core is a strong refutation of the claim that Unix and Linux are the embodiment of perfection. No doubt Linux Zealots will hate this book, but I found it to be a highly enjoyable read. The only flaw is that, being published in 1994, the material is quite out of date in sections are no longer applicable to modern technology. In spite of this, I highly recommend The Unix Hater's Handbook to anyone wishing to hear a different viewpoint besides the Linux propaganda spewed forth from the maws of geekdom.	2005-10-11

Spending time doing fun stuff with the kids is an absolute priority.  <br />Regardless of the chores around  - there is always laundry to be done or mail to sort out. However those chores are always going to be there. They are not going away but my children have only a few years to be children. They will grow up and I don't want to miss out on their growing up years.  <br />I want my kids to look back and think about the time they spent sleeping in an indoor makeshift tent or playing \\"dress up\\" with Mommy. They are not going to reminisce about the time spent doing homework or brushing their teeth before going to bed. Today I am as delighted as my cherubs that I made colored soda with Sprite and watercolors for the dolls tea party ,played tag around the coffee table, ate ice cream with pickles and potato chips. The list can go on <br />Oliver... is a great read for all parents along with their children - I actually feel it is an aide to planning pleasurable moments in your child's day. I would re-read this book as a constant reminder to not get caught up in my household tasks and errands that have to be run but plan some humorous and entertaining moments with the kids.  <br />Thanks Susan Taylor Brown for providing you the insight that we all seem to miss in balancing career & home. We seem to miss out on the amusing side of life. I think I am now going to treat myself to some tomfoolery however impractical that may sound. <br />Go ahead you all - indulge in some comical instances today.

But certainly not race. You know, J. Philippe Rushton may be the most brave man on the planet for publishing this book on a topic so verboten that it actually got him investigated by the Ontario police. Canada, what a country, everyday I wake up pleased that I don't live there.<br /><br />Rushton informs the reader in his Preface that his goal is to examine whether or not innate differences between the races exist. He is not interested in proscribing policy or advocating positions, yet, for many in our universities, objectivity is a curse word they may not believe can even exist in any capacity. Rushton unwittingly stepped into a punji trap by daring not to grovel before activists disguised as professors. The classic confusion between politics and science can best be summed up in an exchange I had with an instructor last summer. In reference to a discussion on sex differences she said: \\"But what good do you do society by studying things like that?\\" The answer: the goal is to find truth. However, to elucidate the truth not only is the reason we have universities in the first place, but also a great good in itself.<br /><br />What you have before you with Race, Evolution, and Behavior is the attempt on the part of a learned social scientist to integrate theory with reality. Rushton analyzes 60 separate factors and compares them to see if disparities exist among Asians, Caucasians, and blacks. Some discrepancies, such as skin cancer rate, society will accept without a blush, but others, such as intelligence are more flammable than a depot of kerosene. Rushton doesn't glide, he heroically pushes forth with facts and research. In my humble opinion, this beleaguered scientist is a hero.	2005-10-11

I LOVE this cookbook even more than her first (The Voluptuous Vegan).<br /><br />The recipes are not only simple, nutritious, and delicious, they are fun to prepare.<br /><br />The Sesame Tuna is out of this world and I have prepared this recipe again and again for my family.  It's a House Favorite along with the Pecan Crusted Trout, Indonesian Corn Chowder, Braised Tempeh with Curried Coconut Sauce and the Tempeh Ruebens with Carmelized Onions.

Other must-try's are: Browned Butter Berry Galette, Sesame Biscotti, both of the Luscious Puddings, and  Roasted Peaches with Caramel Sauce.<br /><br />This cookbook stays on my bookstand in my kitchen because I use it all the time.

Yes, it is in the best seller section	I walked into my local BAMM and found Unfit For Command in the best seller section, right near the paperback best sellers and close to Rich Dad Poor Dad which is also still a best seller. <br /> <br />In the same area was The 100 People Who Are Scrwing Up America. My only disagreement with this book is t hat Kerry didn't make the front cover of that book as well. <br /> <br />So yes, UFC is back int he best seller ranks. Of course, if all you do is sit in front of your pc and never leave the house or visit a bookstore, you won't be able to find it will you? And you can't base all your information on what you read from the free stuff here on the internet. <br /> <br />I think what really bothers this one Kerry-shill is that Corsi and O'Neill don't provide a free look inside the book which is why they are clueless on the contents and can't answer the questions that have been asked here. Nor have they ever bought or read this book.  <br /> <br />So I ask you, why write not one, not two but dozens, perhaps hundreds of reviews on a book that you don't own and have never read?

The news was serious, but she and her co-anchor, Lloyd Dobyns, seemed to be taking it all with a grain of salt, enjoying their gig while all the grown-up anchors were asleep. It was fun to watch reporters who weren't taking themselves too seriously.<br /><br />For the most part, Ellerbee maintains that attitude in Take Big Bites, but it's a bit difficult when you've been through a few marriages, breast cancer, and reporting from war zones. Take Big Bites isn't exactly a memoir, it's a collection of essays and memories of places she's been, people she's met, food she's eaten. You can take it in order, or skip around, as Ellerbee has done.<br /><br />I suggest small bites, contrary to Ellerbee's advice. A little bit of Ellerbee goes a long way. Her first encounter with pho, Vietnamese noodle soup is amusing, and so is her reaction to Singapore. But there is a bit too much homespun philosophy for my taste, as well as James Taylor lyrics. I like JT as much as anyone who came of age in the Seventies, but quoting him this much seems like an odd 'blast-from-the-past'.	2005-10-11

US	48534487	R28GLMYWB17Z5R	0670034460	360300095	The Planets	Books	5	59	68	N	N	Wonderful mix of history, science and sheer enthusiasm	Dava Sobel's newest offering deviates from the historical path of her previous work, but the stellar prose that remains in The Planets will inevitably pull in any who wander too close. This book touches on the social, religious and intellectual aspects of the solar system from antiquity to January 2005, but cannot properly be called history; Sobel simply stuffs the most interesting stories and facts about each celestial body into a slim 231 pages (plus a glossary and a brief appendix of factual details). Of course, interesting stories and facts about the planets could easily fill a book many, many times as long. The beauty of The Planets is that Sobel (who has clearly culled from an enormous pool of potential content) selected only most fascinating and unusual to include. Few but historians of planetary astronomy and the most dedicated trivia buffs are likely to be bored by too much they already know, even though nearly everything comes from published sources. And even if the contents are old news, Sobel's packaging is a joy.    The Planets is organized into thematic chapters that, for the most part, read like separate essays. The introduction and conclusion give the context for Sobel's longtime and continuing passion for the Planets; the former is not particularly riveting, but does not detract. The chapters-there are ten including the Sun and the Moon, with Uranus and Neptune sharing one-bear titles indicating the overarching theme of each, though each theme is stretched far enough to allow a feeling of continuity as the book proceeds outward from the Sun to the edge of the solar system.    Beginning appropriately with \\"Genesis,\\" Sobel's Sun chapter is perhaps the least novel (as well as the shortest). Sobel gives an overview of basic facts and trivia about the Sun, while beginning and ending with invocations of creation and drawing a few parallels between the scientific and religious stories. Mercury's \\"Mythology\\" has the easiest theme (mostly Greek, though it dabbles in other cultures), but Sobel makes it interesting by telling the scientific history of the planet through anecdotes of scientists applying the same mythological themes to their work. The integration of science and culture is even smoother in Venus' chapter, simply themed \\"Beauty;\\" highlights include poetry on Venus by scientists and literary figures alike (and what sophisticated history of science is complete without a William Blake reference?). Our own pale blue dot offers a change of pace; Sobel tromps through a brief history of the developments of Earth's \\"Geography,\\" dispelling a number of common historical myths in the process. \\"Lunacy\\" vaguely revolves around Moon superstitions but is mostly filled with interesting facts.    One of The Planets' best chapters is \\"Sci-Fi,\\" which is told entirely from the perspective of a 4.5 billion year old Martian rock that crashed into Antarctica sixteen million years ago. The rock tells its own story and that of Mars, explaining how its home planet has been the object of such fascination among Earth natives through science fiction. Jupiter has the honor-or shame, depending on one's perspective-of bearing the theme of \\"Astrology.\\" Given it's role in the careers of Galileo, Kepler and so many other early astronomers, historians of science should appreciate Sobel's choice for the king of the planets, despite whatever offense contemporary astronomers may take. Saturn's \\"Music of the Spheres\\" addresses the numerological aspects of the history of planetary astronomy, opening with a discussion of Gustav Holst and interspersed with other musical references. Uranus and Neptune share \\"Night Air,\\" which tells their stories of discoveries mostly through the eloquent correspondence of 19th-century American astronomer Maria Mitchell. \\"UFO\\" is nominally Pluto's chapter, but as the name suggest, Pluto is odd planet (if it can even be considered one) out, more similar to other recently discovered Kuiper Belt objects than its traditional brethren. Discussion of such discoveries segues into the conclusion, which brings planetary astronomy up to the ongoing investigation of Saturn and its moon Titan.    General readers will take a lot from this book: a head full of scientific knowledge about the planets, details and anecdotes about how that knowledge was produced, and an appreciation for their historical cultural significance as well. But the greatest gift Sobel grants the reader is a small piece of her enthusiasm; The Planets makes you want to, if not become an astronomer, at least do more reading on the subject.	2005-10-11

The first story featured a murder mystery within the animation industry (Michael Joens has past week in the animation field.) and in this novel, the plot revolves around people involved in horse-racing and breeding.<br /><br />Our heroine, Sandra Cameron is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder from the events of the past story. She's having nightmares as well as breakdowns and although her relationship with Tom Rigby, as well the kitten Sylvie he gave to her, have helped, she's still pretty messed up. Things only seem to go from bad to worse when the murder case in this novel, of horse trainer  Chet Gundry, ends up involving both her and her father as potential suspects.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, there are more deaths and more potential suspects as well. The web grows quite complicated and the strain takes its toll on both Sandra and Tom. It'll keep you guessing right up to the end.<br /><br />I didn't enjoy \\"Blood Reins\\" quite as much as \\"An Animated Death in Burbank,\\" but overall it was still a great story. It's probably just because I have an interest in animation, but don't really care much about horses. Still, if you enjoyed the first book in the series, you'll probably like this one. And I'm definitely looking forward to the next installment in the series.	2005-10-11

He repeats lines over and over, gives us the punch line and then repeats it at the end of a story, then next story repeats a line because he must think the solid repetition moves us to deeper emotion.  His pro-war stance, the idea that war makes men is severely outdated.  Vietnam may be his obsession but the goal of literature is not to write for therapy but to write for clarity and experience.  He is unable to all of these.  It comes off like the party bore who won't stop talking about a single subject, crying to make sure you feel the emotion along the way.  Many better books on Vietnam exist out there. That this was a Pulitzer finalist is a true insult to many better writers.	2005-10-11

Goldratt, is an intelligent, metaphoric business novel that introduced the Theory of Constraints (TOC) and helped launch a revolutionary era in economic theory as it relates to production and quality improvement. The TOC replaces time honored metrics of cost accounting as the prime measure of productivity and includes some common sense concepts, such as, throughput, inventory, and operational expense.<br /><br />This change in thinking results from the notion that \\"bottlenecks\\" are the prime determinant of a plant's throughput. This concept is pertinent not only to industries that produce manufactured goods, but it has important applications in service industries as well. To convey these new concepts, Goldratt resurrects an ancient teaching technique, the Socratic Method, to enhance the learning experience of his characters and his readers.  He also cultivates an understanding of complex concepts, such as \\"statistical fluctuations in dependent events\\" through real world examples, such as, a Boy Scout Troop's hike through the woods.<br /><br />Alex Rogo, the principle character of the book, is the plant manager for UniCo whose product is never revealed. Since the factory has not made money for some time, the story starts when Alex is informed of the possible closure of his plant.  Rogo was from Bearington, the location of this plant, so he takes pride in his position as the plant manager. He is extremely motivated to turn the factory around.  Most of his activities have centered on crisis management, such as, finishing and shipping orders in response to mounting customer complaints. He has been spending most of his waking time at the plant trouble shooting, and this has taken a toll on his personal life to a point that his marriage to Julie is failing.  With the plant always taking priority over Alex's family life, the reader recognizes the strong work ethic and dedication typically expected from individuals at this level of management in contemporary life.<br /><br />Julie Rogo is a two dimensional character who fits the stereotype of the stay at home  \\"wife,\\" takes care of the kids, and requires a certain amount of attention from her husband.  Up until the very end of the book, she has very little interest in the plant and Alex's work. Most of the time, she is nagging him despite his pending career disaster.  The last straw for Julie was when Alex took their son on a scouting trip rather than spending the day with her. This seems very immature on Julie's part, but then again, she was obviously not very happy with their relationship. Her change in attitude follows a period of separation during which she continues to \\"date\\" Alex. The couple seems to reinvigorate their interest in one another, probably because they elevated the constraint of \\"time\\" in their relationship. While dating, they discovered more effective behaviors to enhance their relationship.<br /><br />Goldratt probably used Julie as an example of how horrific one's personal life can become when a job is made more difficult and time consuming than necessary by process mismanagement.  To that end, Julie served the purpose, but I believe that this book could have been a better novel by adding more complexity to her character.  This book probably has more appeal to those readers who do not customarily read novels (i.e. non-fiction readers).  For those who enjoy reading for pleasure, I would suspect that the economic lessons imbedded in this story does not compensate for any possible lack of character development. As a non-fiction reader, I may not be the best judge of \\"character\\" development in fiction. Yet, despite my lack of interest in contemporary fiction, The Goal illustrated how teaching can be made more interesting by encapsulating the learning objectives in a narrative.<br /><br />Bill Peach, the division vice president, informed Alex that he had only three months to turn the plant around or else face closure. This \\"time constraint\\" wasnot accidental or incidental to the story.  Most systems have a primary and a secondary constraint, and these constraints are generally two of the following three factors: time, money, or quality. Having triple constraints, i.e., all three of the previous constraints, can make a project very difficult to achieve. Successful projects should have at least one of the three previous factors relatively unconstrained. For instance, on May 25, 1961, President Kennedy announced, \\"I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to earth.\\"<br /><br />That short statement contained two primary constraints: time (\\"before the decade is out\\") and quality (\\"landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to earth\\"), but said nothing about money or costs.  During the life of the Apollo project, the priority between time and quality fluctuated. When quality issues arose, such as, the fire of Apollo 1 resulting in the death of three astronauts, NASA elevated \\"quality\\" as their priority, at any cost. Although, Congress frequently complained about the size of the NASA budget, the project remained fully funded beyond Apollo 11 and the moon landing. It was not until the seventies with the mounting cost of the Viet Nam War, growing inflationary problems in the economy, and perhaps a loss of vision by our country that \\"costs\\" were elevated as the primary constraint in continuing to launch men to the moon.<br /><br />Goldratt, through the character of Bill Peach, sets the plant constraints as \\"time\\" (three months) and \\"money\\" (make the plant profitable), but then through the character of Alex Rogo embarks on a discovery of quality management (TOC) where the reader learns an irony that exists in any system of constraint. The true constraint for most systems is quality, not time or money. The great awakening that occurs through the Socratic Method and real world examples is that \\"quality\\" management is the only true constraint to any operation.  By managing quality appropriately, the constraints of time and money will also be properly managed as a byproduct. \\"Quality\\" has a broad meaning; it encapsulates the best of all human characteristics, including creativity, innovation, management, and discipline. This lesson is elevated to conscious awareness by the novel through the character of Jonah, Alex's old physics professor.<br /><br />Alex accidentally runs into Jonah at an airport and during their conversation Alex brags about the plant's new robots.  After a few probing questions, Alex realizes that Jonah has far more insight into his plant's operation than he has; so, from that moment, Alex pursues the tutelage of Jonah.  Alex keeps looking for answers, but Jonah just gives him more questions that continue to lead to a path of discovery. At times, I felt Alex's frustration with Jonah.  Why don't you just get to the point? In a follow up book, Goldratt explains why he used the Socratic Method so heavily in The Goal.<br /><br />He explains that the process of ongoing improvement should be the norm in any industry, but any improvement requires a change in behavior by the workers.  \\"Any change is a perceived threat to security (Theory of Constraint, 1990, p. 10).\\" This gives rise to emotional resistance which must be overcome by a stronger emotion.  Such emotions can be evoked by a threat of job loss, but instead Goldratt prefers a more powerful emotion based upon the \\"meaning to life\\" that the inventor of an idea experiences.  By originating an idea, the resulting emotion can inspire and overcome great resistance.<br /><br />Thus, the Socratic Method triggers the emotion of the inventor.  \\"The minute you supply a person with the answers, by that very action you block them, once and for all, from the opportunity of inventing those same answers for themselves.  The Goal deliberately elaborates on Alex's struggle to find the answers, so that the intuition of the reader will have sufficient time to crystallize (Theory of Constraint, 1990, p. 18).\\" The Goal is mesmerizing and fast paced because \\"the readers are inventing the answers before they read them (TOC, p.19).\\" He further explains that the Socratic Method effectively makes the problem the reader's problem, and the usual ways to solve these problems do not work.<br /><br />Goldratt uses two mechanisms of ascertaining proof in his Socratic discourse: the Cause and Effect Method and the Evaporating Clouds technique. He explains these in his book The Theory of Constraints.  Every endeavor of human inquiry goes through distinct stages of development.  The earliest and perhaps least developed stage is \\"classification,\\" in which observations that share like properties are grouped together.  The next stage is \\"correlation,\\" in which relationships seem to exist between properties of a system.  During this phase, the question of HOW seems to dominate.  Only when human inquiry reaches the last stage, \\"cause and effect,\\" does it become scientific.  This line of inquiry is more concerned with the WHY of a process, and establishes logical deductions and explanations.  Thus, the assumption that the goal, making money, can be measured by throughput, operational expense, and inventory is illustrated in this book by the cause and effect principle.<br /><br />The Evaporating Clouds technique is based upon the fact that most people have preconceived notions of acceptable solutions to a problem. This acts as a block to re-thinking a dilemma.  Such preconceived solutions usually arise out of a compromise that minimizes the number of changes necessary to create an environment where the problem no longer exists. The Evaporating Clouds technique provides a framework to overcome preconceived notions. The \\"precise definition of the problem\\" is the first step in utilizing the technique.  Next, \\"the requirements that must be fulfilled (Theory of Constraint, 1990, p. 37-8)\\" should be identified, and in most circumstances one can expect conflicting goals. \\"Compromise\\" arises when achieving both goals is attempted by sharing resources or doing one thing at the expense of the other.<br /><br />The Evaporating Clouds technique seeks to eliminate this conflict all together rather than finding a compromise solution.  Generally this is achieved by restating the problem in more global terms.  This is clearly seen in the dilemma in the batch size of the work orders.  In an effort to facilitate the movement of work through the bottleneck part, the NCX10, batch size and the composition of the batch is varied.  They even color code parts to insure that certain inventory critical to production are processed first.  To their surprise, this results in the emergence of new bottlenecks.  That problem \\"disappears\\" completely after they allow the bottleneck itself to determine the flow of the non-constrained resources.  The dilemma over the \\"size\\" and \\"type\\" of inventory to process \\"evaporated\\" away in a \\"cloud.\\"<br /><br />The relationship among Alex, his staff, and Jonah develops throughout the book, and it becomes the centerpiece to learning these new concepts of business management.  Jonah is a busy business consultant, which is a far cry from a physics professor. The book never explains how Jonah becomes involved in this line of work, but Goldratt associates the scientific method of physics to the Socratic Method of learning.  Jonah helps Alex realize that the goal of any manufacturing organization is to make money, and that every action of the company should bring it closer to that goal.  Up to that time, the prevalence of stale concepts of \\"cost accounting\\" resulted in outdated performance metrics for plant operations, i.e., resource efficiency, net profit, return on investment, and cash flow.  Overemphasis upon these isolated factors with no interrelated metrics was at the root of the plant's failure.<br /><br />To make matters worse, the plant had invested in expensive robots that did not contribute to the overall performance of the plant. The robots seemed to be a symbol of all \\"high technology\\" equipment, and the message from Goldratt was clear.  The utilization of high-tech does not guaranty success.  Jonah's measurement of plant performance was quite different. They include \\"throughput, inventory, and operational expense.\\"  Jonah gave these concepts to Alex in a brief phone conversation, so Rogo brought them back to his plant to discuss them with Bob Donovan (production manager), Lou (plant controller), Stacey (inventory control), and Ralph (data processing).  The resulting discussions helped the reader absorb the intricate inter-relations between these concepts.<br /><br />\\"Throughput\\" is the rate at which any system generates money through sales.  \\"Inventory\\" is the money tied up in purchasing things a business expects to sell. \\"Operational expense\\" is the money spent to turn inventory into throughput.  Contrary to the principles of cost accounting, these new metrics account for the value added steps that occur during the production of throughput in a different way.  Under the new metrics, labor and depreciation in manufacturing plant are expenses, not inventory. Likewise, knowledge is an expense unless the plant is selling the knowledge. These changes eliminate the confusion of whether certain stages of production should be accounted for as an expense or an investment in inventory. Under Jonah's metrics, there are only three forms of money in the plant: money coming in from \\"throughput;\\" money stuck in the plant as \\"inventory;\\" and money going out as \\"operational expense.\\"<br /><br />The ultimate goal is to increase \\"throughput\\" while simultaneously decreasing \\"inventory\\" and \\"operational expense.\\"  Jonah quickly points out that any single factor cannot be changed without affecting at least one other of these three measures.  The old concept of a \\"balanced plant\\" taught in cost accounting can actually result in a decrease in throughput and a precipitous increase in inventory.  These two factors are a formula for lost revenues, or a movement away from the goal.  In a balanced plant each and every resource is matched exactly to the demand for that resource. Excess capacity is viewed as a lost opportunity to reduce operational expenses.  In reality, though, if excess capacity of plant resources is trimmed too much, throughput will decrease.<br /><br />Jonah states that a balanced plant is doomed to fail due to \\"statistical fluctuations in dependent events.\\"  This new concept puzzles Alex until he encounters Herbie on a Boy Scout Troop hike in the woods. Herbie, due to his over-stuffed backpack is unable to keep up with the rest of the troop.  His slow pace results in huge delays in the line's progress toward their final destination.  Alex realizes that the ability to move faster than the average speed of each Boy Scout is limited.  The accumulation of each individual's speed that falls below the average speed of the line results in no lower limit on how much the progress of the troop can be delayed.  The bottom line is that in a linear dependency of two or more variables, the fluctuations of the variables down the line will center on the maximum deviation established by any preceding variable.  Thus, throughput will be equal to the slowest person in the line at any given time.<br /><br />With the Boy Scout troop hike, one can draw an analogy to Jonah's metrics of a plant's operation. Throughput can be viewed as the last Boy Scout in the line. When the last boy arrives at the final destination, throughput has been achieved. The distance between the beginning and the end of the line is inventory, and the energy expended by each boy to keep up with the line is operational expense.  When the distance in the line increases, throughput is reduced and inventory is increased.  To catch up, more energy must be expended, so operational expense increases.  This example clearly illustrates that inventory moves through a system not in a manageable flow, but in waves.  The system can get further and further behind due to the accumulation of negative deviations from the average.  Thus, the capacity of a resource cannot be measured in isolation, but its position in the production process must be considered.<br /><br />Once Alex and his team came to this realization, they were able to identify two kinds of plant resources: bottleneck and non-bottleneck resources. A bottleneck resource has a capacity that is equal to or less than the demand placed upon it.  A non-bottleneck resource has a capacity that is greater than the demand placed upon it. Rather than using the balanced plant model of cost accounting, where each resource is balanced with the demand for the individual resource, the plant should strive to balance the flow of the product through the plant with the market demand for that product. Or more precisely, the flow through the bottleneck resource should equal the market demand for the product.  All attempts should be made to maximize the bottleneck resource since it directly determines throughput.<br /><br />Alex and his team identified the NCX10 as the bottleneck resources in their plant.  They took several steps to increase the capacity of the NCX10, such as, putting quality control ahead of the machine so it would only process good parts, keeping it operational all the time even during lunch and breaks, having it work only on parts that could not be processed by some other machine, and by reactivating retired equipment that could perform the same function at a slower pace.  Other bottleneck optimizing steps included processing parts that would only contribute to throughput today; otherwise, a build up of inventory would result. Any increase in inventory decreases the plant's cash flow since inventory ties up money.  Likewise, when one attempts to run a non-bottleneck part at peak efficiency, excess inventory is the result.  It too should only work on parts that contribute to throughput today.<br /><br />The level of utilization of a non-bottleneck resource should not be determined by its own potential, but rather by the constraint in the system.  Goldratt emphasizes this principle by distinguishing between \\"activating\\" a resource and \\"utilizing\\" a resource.  Activating resources initiates some type of mechanized process or labor force, but does not necessarily result in profit.  A system with local optimums is not an optimal system; it's an inefficient system. Utilizing these same resources only insofar as it contributes to throughput today is an efficient system despite the existence of excess capacity in the individual non-bottleneck resource. A non-bottleneck part should be released according to assembly capacity and bottleneck processing.  Idle capacity is frequently a fixed cost, so increasing its utilization results in no additional savings despite any increase in the local efficiency.  Excess inventory, on the other hand, that results from efficiency based upon local optimums will decrease cash flow.<br /><br />These lessons, once learned by Alex and his team resulted in measurable improvements in the plant.  Even Bill Peach took notice.  Goldratt interjects a dramatic element in the form of a competitive plant manager named Hilton Smyth who is trying to advance in the division by discrediting Alex and his team. However, Alex's next wave of discovery puts his team firmly in the winners circle and gains Alex a promotion to division manager. After running into rolling bottlenecks in the plant from a part-marking system they implemented to maximize bottleneck and non-bottleneck resources, Alex and his team decided to take a more serious look at process times.<br /><br />The team identified the following four process times.  \\"Setup time\\" is time spent waiting while the bottleneck resource prepares to work on the part.  \\"Process time\\" is the time spent modifying the part into a new form.  \\"Queue time\\" isspent in line waiting for a resource that is busy working on another part.  \\"Waiting time\\" is the time that a part waits on another part for assembly.  Alex and his team determine that the bulk of the time is spent in queue time and waiting time. Both of these are determined by the bottleneck resource, the NCX10.  By reducing the batch size, both waiting and queue time can be reduced.  This had a net effect of increasing the speed of processing and cash flow, while at the same time decreasing inventory, order lead times, and time to market. Some excess capacity of the non-bottleneck resources were absorbed due to smaller batch sizes, but this did not increase costs in any way.<br /><br />Alex had discovered that certain non-bottleneck resources are \\"capacity constraint resources\\" in that they depend upon the sequence of the work process.  These resources determine which process should occur first, and unless properly managed, can result in the emergence of new bottlenecks. When properly managed, though, plant throughput can be increased. The best way to determine the order of part processing is by paying attention to the demands of the bottleneck resource. With this new discovery, Alex approached Johnny Jons, the marketing manager, to increase their orders.  They accepted new business from abroad that was below their normal price points.  Since all fixed costs were covered by their normal process load, most of the money received from these foreign orders was profit (minus the variable costs).<br /><br />A very important lesson was learned about spare capacity and inventory control. Excess capacity is necessary, and it can be absorbed to facilitate bottleneck movement when a delay occurs.  If excess capacity is not available, then bottleneck delays will result in lost throughput. Additionally, an inverse relationship exists between spare capacity and inventory.  If excess inventory is available in front of the bottleneck resource, then less spare capacity is needed.  If spare capacity is increased, then lower inventory is necessary in front of the bottleneck resource. Thus excess capacity in non-bottleneck resources results in lower inventory levels and greater cash flow.  Attempting to reduce both excess capacity and inventory simultaneously is a recipe for reduced throughput and disaster.<br /><br />The book has a happy ending.  Alex and Julie reconcile. The plant and perhaps all of UniCo is saved. Alex is promoted to division manager, and Alex's team is promoted up the ladder. By the way, Hilton Smyth is discredited. Jonah had asked Alex to pay him whatever he thought his services were worth if the plant was saved.  I was surprised when Goldratt did not complete that part of the transaction. Perhaps this is his only accounting error.  The book concludes with Alex and Lou trying to identify the process that led to the plant's turnaround. That is when Goldratt summarizes the basic principles contained in the Theory of Constraint.  He seems to speed through this part of the book to my disappointment.  He does provide more detail in his follow up book, Theory of Constraints, published in 1990.<br /><br />Alex and Lou identified a five step process that they did not label, but Goldratt calls it the Theory of Constraints.  Before listing each step, one must understand the goal of the system, and the measurements that will help one gauge the achievement of that goal.  In this case, the goal was to make money, and the metrics were throughput, inventory, and operational expense. Since every system has at least one constraint, the first step in the Theory of Constraints is to \\"identify the system's constraints and prioritize them according to their impact upon the goal. Second, all resources, non-constraint or constrained, should be managed in such a way to maximize the output of the constrained resource.  Third, whatever the constraints, a way to limit their impact must be devised. Fourth, the constraint should be elevated until it is broken.  The final and fifth step is to go back to the process and look for new emergent constraints once the original constraint has been broken.<br /><br />This last step states that an ongoing improvement process must occur rather than patting oneself on the back for a job well done.  For an ongoing process to be effective every manager must understand \\"WHAT TO CHANGE.\\" In other words, the manager must identify the core problems that will result in a major improvement upon the system once changed.  Also, to avoid panic and chaos, the manager must know \\"WHAT TO CHANGE TO.\\"  The final managerial duty is the most difficult, \\"HOW TO CAUSE THE CHANGE.\\"  Alex sees it as \\"the amount of inertia that we can expect from the division.\\"  He concludes by asking,\\" If a manager doesn't know how to answer those three questions, is he or she entitled to be called manager?\\" The abrupt ending that followed this brief discussion left me confused at first, but then I realized that it may be a great time to turn to the Socratic Method.  It also proved to be a great segway to Goldratt's next book, the Theory of Constraints.<br /><br />In the final analysis, The Goal illustrates that the real constraint upon any system is \\"quality,\\" or \\"continuous quality improvement.\\"  Money should always be a constraint in all systems, so any industry that operates in an environment where there is no limitation on financial resources is unrealistic and not of this world.  Economics is the study of the efficient use of scarce resources to achieve the maximum satisfaction of economic wants.  In essence, accepting that premise is what a mathematician calls a \\"zero-sum-game,\\" i.e., one person's loss is another person's gain.  This may be true for a period of time, but technology can serve to expand the resources available at affordable prices.<br /><br />How do technological advances affect the resource limitations of an economic system? In Unlimited Wealth, Paul Pilzer lists three technology factors that, when present, can propel an economy faster than the rate of capital accumulation (money). In his book he writes:<br />1.Technology is the major determinant of wealth because it determines the nature and supply of physical resources.<br />2.The advance of technology is determined mainly by our ability to process information.<br />3.The backlog of unimplemented technological advances is the true predictor of economic growth for both the individual and society (p. 16).<br /><br />Thus, technological advances can turn \\"limited resources\\" into \\"unlimited resources.\\" For instance, insulin can now be commercially synthesized at a fraction of the cost and in unlimited supplies compared to older methods of harvesting the compound from animals. The motivating factors in the development of these technological advances that lead to \\"unlimited wealth\\" are the limitations of the natural world itself, or more specifically the limitations of financial resources.<br /><br />Can the limitations of money lead to improved technology and unlimited resources?  On October 4, 2004 Burt Rotan's SpaceShipOne, a privately built space craft, was dropped from its mother ship, the White Knight, and rocketed 62 miles into space to win the coveted Ansari X Prize of $10 million.  Microsoft's founder Paul Allen spent $20 million to win the prize and to be the first commercial venture to launch a passenger into outer space. This seems to make little economic sense, but the technology that resulted from this endeavor will lead to the profitable commercialization of space flight and have a dramatic impact upon the future direction of space exploration. Rotan designed a moveable wing unit for SpaceShipOne that eases reentry into earth's atmosphere making heat shields unnecessary and greatly lowers the risk of reentry accidents.<br /><br />One can only theorize how differently the Apollo project would have progressed if President Kennedy had said \\"I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to earth on a budget of $10 million.\\"  In the end, continuing the mission of Apollo with a blank check proved unrealistic.  At the same time, the realities of our current limited financial resources may result in more efficient resource allocation and ultimately in the discovery of newer technologies that can be widely applied. The key to all this seems to be ongoing quality improvement and technological advancement at every scale of the economy. This is the lesson made clear in The Goal.a system not in a manageable flow, but in waves.  The system can get further and further behind due to the accumulation of negative deviations from the average.  Thus, the capacity of a resource cannot be measured in isolation, but its position in the production process must be considered.           Once Alex and his team came to this realization, they were able to identify two kinds of plant resources: bottleneck and non-bottleneck resources. A bottleneck resource has a capacity that is equal to or less than the demand placed upon it.  A non-bottleneck resource has a capacity that is greater than the demand placed upon it. Rather than using the balanced plant model of cost accounting, where each resource is balanced with the demand for the individual resource, the plant should strive to balance the flow of the product through the plant with the market demand for that product. Or more precisely, the flow through the bottleneck resource should equal the market demand for the product.  All attempts should be made to maximize the bottleneck resource since it directly determines throughput.         Alex and his team identified the NCX10 as the bottleneck resources in their plant.  They took several steps to increase the capacity of the NCX10, such as, putting quality control ahead of the machine so it would only process good parts, keeping it operational all the time even during lunch and breaks, having it work only on parts that could not be processed by some other machine, and by reactivating retired equipment that could perform the same function at a slower pace.  Other bottleneck optimizing steps included processing parts that would only contribute to throughput today; otherwise, a build up of inventory would result. Any increase in inventory decreases the plant's cash flow since inventory ties up money.  Likewise, when one attempts to run a non-bottleneck part at peak efficiency, excess inventory is the result.  It too should only work on parts that contribute tothroughput today.            The level of utilization of a non-bottleneck resource should not be determined by its own potential, but rather by the constraint in the system.  Goldratt emphasizes this principle by distinguishing between \\"activating\\" a resource and \\"utilizing\\" a resource.  Activating resources initiates some type of mechanized process or labor force, but does not necessarily result in profit.  A system with local optimums is not an optimal system; it's an inefficient system. Utilizing these same resources only insofar as it contributes to throughput today is an efficient system despite the existence of excess capacity in the individual non-bottleneck resource. A non-bottleneck part should be released according to assembly capacity and bottleneck processing.  Idle capacity is frequently a fixed cost, so increasing its utilization results in no additional savings despite any increase in the local efficiency.  Excess inventory, on the other hand, that results from efficiency based upon local optimums will decrease cash flow.           These lessons, once learned by Alex and his team resulted in measurable improvements in the plant.  Even Bill Peach took notice.  Goldratt interjects a dramatic element in the form of a competitive plant manager named Hilton Smyth who is trying to advance in the division by discrediting Alex and his team.

Alex had discovered that certain non-bottleneck resources are \\"capacity constraint resources\\" in that they depend upon the sequence of the work process.  These resources determine which process should occur first, and unless properly managed, can result in the emergence of new bottlenecks. When properly managed, though, plant throughput can be increased. The best way to determine the order of part processing is by paying attention to the demands of the bottleneck resource. With this new discovery, Alex approached Johnny Jons, the marketing manager, to increase their orders.  They accepted new business from abroad that was below their normal price points.  Since all fixed costs were covered by their normal process load, most of the money received from these foreign orders was profit (minus the variable costs).           A very important lesson was learned about spare capacity and inventory control. Excess capacity is necessary, and it can be absorbed to facilitate bottleneck movement when a delay occurs.  If excess capacity is not available, then bottleneck delays will result in lost throughput. Additionally, an inverse relationship exists between spare capacity and inventory.  If excess inventory is available in front of the bottleneck resource, then less spare capacity is needed.  If spare capacity is increased, then lower inventory is necessary in front of the bottleneck resource. Thus excess capacity in non-bottleneck resources results in lower inventory levels and greater cash flow.  Attempting to reduce both excess capacity and inventory simultaneously is a recipe for reduced throughput and disaster.         The book has a happy ending.  Alex and Julie reconcile. The plant and perhaps all of UniCo is saved. Alex is promoted to division manager, and Alex's team is promoted up the ladder. By the way, Hilton Smyth is discredited. Jonah had asked Alex to pay him whatever he thought his services were worth if the plant was saved.  I was surprised when Goldratt did not complete that part of the transaction. Perhaps this is his only accounting error.  The book concludes with Alex and Lou trying to identify the process that led to the plant's turnaround. That is when Goldratt summarizes the basic principles contained in the Theory of Constraint.  He seems to speed through this part of the book to my disappointment.  He does provide more detail in his follow up book, Theory of Constraints, published in 1990.           Alex and Lou identified a five step process that they did not label, but Goldratt calls it the Theory of Constraints.  Before listing each step, one must understand the goal of the system, and the measurements that will help one gauge the achievement of that goal.  In this case, the goal was to make money, and the metrics were throughput, inventory, and operational expense. Since every system has at least one constraint, the first step in the Theory of Constraints is to \\"identify the system's constraints and prioritize them according to their impact upon the goal. Second, all resources, non-constraint or constrained, should be managed in such a way to maximize the output of the constrained resource.  Third, whatever the constraints, a way to limit their impact must be devised. Fourth, the constraint should be elevated until it is broken.  The final and fifth step is to go back to the process and look for new emergent constraints once the original constraint has been broken.           This last step states that an ongoing improvement process must occur rather than patting oneself on the back for a job well done.  For an ongoing process to be effective every manager must understand \\"WHAT TO CHANGE.\\" In other words, the manager must identify the core problems that will result in a major improvement upon the system once changed.   Also, to avoid panic and chaos, the manager must know \\"WHAT TO CHANGE TO.\\"  The final managerial duty is the most difficult, \\"HOW TO CAUSE THE CHANGE.\\"  Alex sees it as \\"the amount of inertia that we can expect from the division.\\"  He concludes by asking,\\" If a manager doesn't know how to answer those three questions, is he or she entitled to be called manager?\\" The abrupt ending that followed this brief discussion left me confused at first, but then I realized that it may be a great time to turn to the Socratic Method.  It also proved to be a great segway to Goldratt's next book, the Theory of Constraints.         In the final analysis, The Goal illustrates that the real constraint upon any system is \\"quality,\\" or \\"continuous quality improvement.\\"  Money should always be a constraint in all systems, so any industry that operates in an environment where there is no limitation on financial resources is unrealistic and not of this world.  Economics is the study of the efficient use of scarce resources to achieve the maximum satisfaction of economic wants.  In essence, accepting that premise is what a mathematician calls a \\"zero-sum-game,\\" i.e., one person's loss is another person's gain.  This may be true for a period of time, but technology can serve to expand the resources available at affordable prices.           How do technological advances affect the resource limitations of an economic system? In Unlimited Wealth, Paul Pilzer lists three technology factors that, when present, can propel an economy faster than the rate of capital accumulation (money). In his book he writes:   1.Technology is the major determinant of wealth because it determines the nature and supply of physical resources.  2.The advance of technology is determined mainly by our ability to process information.  3.The backlog of unimplemented technological advances is the true predictor of economic growth for both the individual and society (p. 16).    Thus, technological advances can turn \\"limited resources\\" into \\"unlimited resources.\\" For instance, insulin can now be commercially synthesized at a fraction of the cost and in unlimited supplies compared to older methods of harvesting the compound from animals. The motivating factors in the development of these technological advances that lead to \\"unlimited wealth\\" are the limitations of the natural world itself, or more specifically the limitations of financial resources.           Can the limitations of money lead to improved technology and unlimited resources?  On October 4, 2004 Burt Rotan's SpaceShipOne, a privately built space craft, was dropped from its mother ship, the White Knight, and rocketed 62 miles into space to win the coveted Ansari X Prize of $10 million.  Microsoft's founder Paul Allen spent $20 million to win the prize and to be the first commercial venture to launch a passenger into outer space. This seems to make little economic sense, but the technology that resulted from this endeavor will lead to the profitable commercialization of space flight and have a dramatic impact upon the future direction of space exploration. Rotan designed a moveable wing unit for SpaceShipOne that eases reentry into earth's atmosphere making heat shields unnecessary and greatly lowers the risk of reentry accidents.           One can only theorize how differently the Apollo project would have progressed if President Kennedy had said \\"I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to earth on a budget of $10 million.\\"  In the end, continuing the mission of Apollo with a blank check proved unrealistic.  At the same time, the realities of our current limited financial resources may result in more efficient resource allocation and ultimately in the discovery of newer technologies that can be widely applied. The key to all this seems to be ongoing quality improvement and technological advancement at every scale of the economy. This is the lesson made clear in The Goal.	2005-10-11

Still, this author is not John Le Carre at his best (George Smiley series).<br /><br />What I found most interesting, as I read through the book and found connections with both my past and with Japan, was the manner in which the author appears to have found a formula for connecting what he has done in his own past, what he has read about, and what he is presumably writing off on his taxes--comprehensive travel.<br /><br />I put the book down, not disappointed--I certainly recommend this book to anyone who has not been a spy--but thinking to myself, WOW, this is what I can do when I retire--travel all over the world, write a spy novel with details about each place I visit, and presto, it is all a grand tax write-off.<br /><br />Professionally speaking the book is way too facile.  Planting an audio device is very very tough.  The need for line of sight from the transmitter to the receiver kills most applications.  Generally speaking, you have to listen for four hours to get five minutes worth of useful stuff.  Killer technologies certainly abound, but as CIA found when it tried to kill Castro with exploding cigars, infected dive suits, beard killers, and the bomb-dropping pigeons, generally technology is not the answer.<br /><br />3 for former spies, 5 for the general public, 4 on balance.

C. S. Lewis actually wrote all 7 stories BEFORE he published them. He published them in a different order so as to create intrest in his stories and market them better. Take the TV show Lost on ABC for example. The do not show the story in chronological order; they repeatedly flashback to before the plane crash so as to create questions while answering only a few at a time. I'm not comparing the two stories together (Lewis would win any day), but to say that they printed them with The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe first to create questions as well as a great story. Later books answered some of those questions while creating more until they were all answered by the close of the series.<br /><br />Scholastic first decided to print them in chronological order because that's way C.

Here, he and his colleagues turn their attention to defining school leadership behaviors and actions that raise student achievement.  They blend practical advice and research to come up with specific steps that school leaders can take to see that students improve academically. <br /> <br />Marzano et al found that there are 21 leadership responsibilities that have a statistically significant relationship with student achievement.  All are important, but the three most correlated with achievement are (1) Situational Awareness (of the specific school situation and good use of this information), (2) Flexibility (to adapt to the specific situation and to handle dissent), and (3) (tied) Discipline (to protect teachers from undue distractions), Outreach (as advocate and spokesperson for the school), and Monitoring/Evaluation (creating a system that provides feedback on effectiveness). <br /> <br />They classified previous efforts at school change into two types.  First-Order Change is incremental, a step-by-step pattern.  Second-Order Change is sudden reversal of pattern or direction, anything but incremental.  Both change processes can be effective, and both require different behaviors by school leaders.  The three most effective behaviors for First-Order Change are (1) Monitoring/Evaluating, (2) Culture (building a positive culture that influences teachers), and (3) Ideals/Beliefs (leader's well-articulated ideals and beliefs).  The three most important behaviors for Second-Order Change are (1) Knowledge of Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment, (2) Optimizer (optimism as a critical characteristic), and (3) Intellectual Stimulation (of Staff). <br /> <br />The third component Marzano et al looked at was the importance of the leader's ability to select the right work or issues for the school staff to tackle to improve achievement,whether through the use of models of site-specific or of comprehensive school reform.  Both models are effective if tailored to the needs and context of a given school. <br /> <br />But hold on.  Don't be discouraged from reading this book because you fear that this is just another text full of education theory and cliches.  Or don't succumb to thoughts of \\"been there, done that\\" and been burned too many times before.  Marzano and company offer a thorough, five-step plan that works for experienced or novice leaders.  They recognize that no one person can do all they suggest, and they show how to share leadership with other educators and community members.  This book is the most clearly defined, research-based plan for improving student achievement you can find today; and everyone, educator or not, who is interested in better student academic growth should read it. <br /> <br />If there were educational awards equivalent to the Congressional Medal of Honor given for service beyond the call of duty for the promotion of student academic excellence, Robert Marzano should receive the first.	2005-10-11

While \\"On the Run: A Mafia Childhood\\" is an entertaining read, it also raises several serious issues.<br /><br />On one level it is a great antidote to the \\"Sopranos\\", \\"The Godfather\\", \\"Wiseguy\\" and all the TV, movies and literature that expose, yet tangentially glorify organized crime.  Organized crime, as experienced by the Hill family, was a family life with Dad going in and out of jail.  Kids being surrounded by drug abusing, sexually irresponsible adults.  Kids living with no sense of security or continuity.  The criminals were just drug abusing, self-centered low-lifes.  Yeah, they flashed cash, and were generous when they had money, and people feared them, but it was all about immediate personal gratification.<br /><br />On another level, the serious questions raised are about the witness protection program.  While it may have allowed prosecutors to use Henry Hill as a witness, it totally destroyed the continuity in the lives of his children who were constantly being yanked from one place to another, unable to tell the truth, unable to continue friendships, unable to have anything resembling a normal childhood.<br /><br />Henry Hill didn't change when he went into witness protection.  He was still a lying, theiving, violent, thug with a severe drug and drinking problem.  Given a new background and government protection was like a free pass to do the same things he'd been doing without consequence to himself.<br /><br />The now adult children make one question whether the witness protection program is ever a good idea.  And, if it is, if it is fair to take the family into it.<br /><br />Gregg and Gina Hill are to be commended for managing to grow up into productive apparently well-adjusted adults.  Interestingly, they come across as remarkably balanced; this is not a whining account of a dysfuntional family.  As dysfunctional as this family was, Gregg and Gina Hill come across as remarkably normal and devoid of self-pity.	2005-10-11

I read the entire thing in one day; definetly a page turner!  As another reviewer mentioned, Jackson does attempt to put in a lot of mystery and suspsense, but at least for me, I found it very effective.  I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.<br /><br />The characters were great.  Brig was the typical \\"bad boy,\\" and was both sexy and sweet enough that I could see why the heroine was so attracted.  Cassidy also was very likable.  She was a spirited tomboy, and very likeable.  The romance between these two was especially sweet because we got to see them when they were young as well as in adulthood.<br /><br />I was a little surprised by how much of the book is spent on the \\"back story.\\"  Based on the book's description, I was expecting there to be maybe a couple chapters of past history, and then the majority of the book spent with Cassidy's return to her home as as an adult.  Instead, there was as much time spent in 1977 as in \\"the present.\\"  This worked out fine since the story of them as teens was interesting, but I wish there would have been a little more of them in the present.  I thought the latter half of the book was really rushed.  As much as I wanted Brig and Cassidy to be together, it was based primarily on their young love, rather than their relationship as adults.  We simply didn't get to see enough of their \\"grown up\\" selves.  Still, I wouldn't say this knocks it down from a 5 star read.<br /><br />As for the mystery, I thought it was well done.  The villan was neither too obvious, nor so obscure that it didn't make sense.<br /><br />This was great for a fun read.  And yes, it is fairly long, but like I said, it moves so quickly that I finished it in a day.  I completely enjoyed it.	2005-10-11

To that end, she provides a useful overview here, in thirty brief, unfootnoted chapters, of the spouses of all the monarchs from William I through William IV. Elizabeth is excluded, obviously, but Mary Tudor is included, as the wife of Philip II of Spain, as are Queen Anne and Queen Mary (of William-and-Mary). There's plenty of gossip and quotations from private correspondence, but the narrative is comfortably non-lurid. A good quick reference for the student of royal genealogy and an enjoyable read.	2005-10-11

You can find the same ideas expressed in other history books about the impact of \\"discovering\\" the new world on the old world.  Mr. Weatherford just does it in an anecdotal style with emphasis on contributions made by the indigenous american people.  What's interesting to me is some of the reviews.  Whenever someone writes a book discussing the ingenuity of indian or other \\"colored\\" people reviews pop up discrediting the book off-hand saying it's politically correct propaganda.  I suspect these reviews are made by white males who cling to the idea the white man is superior and non-white people should be subservient.

Back then in the 1930s, blacks were treated badly just for the color of their skin. Nobody cared about them. As for the whites, some found it hard to live that kind of lifestyle, just like the main characters, Jem and Scout, two siblings living at this time. They live in the town of Maycomb, Alabama. The town seems very boring and desolate. It also seems like they are stuck in a bubble, not able to get out of the town. <br /> <br />The book is narrated by a young girl named Scout who lives during the time when blacks and whites were segregated. Her father is a lawyer and he is often made fun of because he defends black people. Later in the book, he has to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who is charged for the crime of rape of a poor white girl, Mayella Ewell. <br /> <br />Atticus is the father of Jem and Scout. He raises him with their cook, Calpurnia. Atticus teaches Scout everything. He tells her, \\"You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view...Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.\\" She remembers this especially in the end of the book. Atticus says a lot of important things such as \\"There's a lot of ugly things in this world, son. I wish I could keep 'em all away from you. That's never possible.\\" He really cares about his children and he wants them to grow up right. <br /> <br />One summer, Jem and Scout meet their next door neighbor's nephew, Dill, who comes over every summer. They become amused with the house down the street, the Radley's. They want to see the son who is believed to have stabbed his father with scissors, Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley. They have a silent relationship with Boo because of the presents Boo gives them in the knothole of a tree near the Radley house. The presents that he gave them included chewed up gum and figures that looked like them. It was really odd. <br /> <br />When I finished the book and took time to understand the meaning of why it is a sin to kill a mockingbird it all came to me and I liked the book. The book very harsh with racial discrimination, but it is really funny that the children of Maycomb County care more about the blacks than the adults. There are some fun and interesting parts besides the harsh comments, but mainly it focuses on how the past really was. I am still very happy to have been born in the time that I was. You must read this book because it will make you understand the past a little bit better and you will learn from the mistakes people back then made.	2005-10-11

Everest Disaster	Books	5	2	2	N	N	"Triumph of Desire Over Sensibility"	John Krakauer chronicles the tragic chain of events that led to the demise of 12 mountaineers in May, 1996, culminating in the deadliest season in Everest history.  Krakuaer's assignment was to participate in a guided expedition of Everest and write about his experience for \\"Outside\\" magazine.  His piece was published in the September issue.      Tormented by his experience atop Everest, where oxygen depletion can cause a host of debilitating conditions, Krakauer set out to write \\"Into Thin Air\\", hoping to \\"purge Everest from\\" his life.  The result was a book that was widely successful, but did not achieve its therapeutic effect for the author, and worse yet, opened him up to criticism from various sources, including some family members of the deceased.    Nevertheless, this is a story that begged to be told, and Krakauer does an excellent job of piecing it together from Kathmandu to the top of Everest and back.  He focuses on the the lives and actions of participants in his expedition, \\"Mountain Madness\\" led by the seasoned and highly disciplined Rob Hall, and that of \\"Adventure Consultants\\" with Scott Fischer as the guide, both vying for positive press and recognition.    One of the best non-fiction adventure books written.	2005-10-11

It is a follow up to the best seller A Million Little Pieces.  Leonard is a mentor and a father figure to James and a known criminal. Yet, he exposes James to classic paintings and gives him advice like to live honorably and with dignity.<br /><br />One of my favorite parts in the book is where James celebrates his promotion from a cleaning person to a doorman in a bar by buying and eating cake.  Frey also writes very honestly about the anixety and fear he felt working for Leonard as a transporter picking up large amounts of money and delivering it to different places.<br /><br /> My Friend Leonard really moved me in some parts like when James learns that his girlfriend Lilly has committed suicide.  The pain from that personal loss prevented James from having successful close relationships with women for a long time.  Another event in this book that really touched me in this book is where James has to put his much loved pit bull dog to sleep.  I could relate to the pain he felt, because I had to the same thing to my dog.<br /><br /> The most important thing to remember after reading a book like My Friend Leonard is to live every day like it is your last, because you never know how much time left you have to live.  My Friend Leonard is an unique book about the things our friends can teach us about life,  It is also  about how to deal with personal loss in our lives. I really enjoyed it.	2005-10-11

Merwin?  Long acclaimed as one of our most poignant and important poets, his newest collection is an endless stream of homages to fleeting thoughts, ideas, and other delicacies encounter by the informed eye and heart.  Merwin keeps his language simple but continues to prod our senses with challenging concepts.  In these one hundred odd poems he wanders through our perceptions and imaginations and strikes chords familiar and foreign, all with the flowing beauty of his carefully molded words.<br /><br />These poems seem to be odes, not so much to people as to natural matters and objects and notions.  In 'To a Falling Leaf in Winter':  'At sundown when a day's words/ have gathered at the feet of the trees/ lining up in silence/ to enter the long corridors/ of the roots into which they/ pass one by one thinking/ that they remember the place/ as they fell themselves climbing/ away from their only sound/ while they are being forgotten/ by their bright circumstances/ they rise through all the rings/ listening again/ afterward as they/ listened once and they come/ to where the leaves used to live/ during their lives but have gone now/ and they too take the next step/ beyond the reach of meaning.'<br /><br />There are no adequate descriptives for Merwin's gifts.  They are simply there for the savouring of those with quiet hearts to read and hear.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, October 05	2005-10-11

Before the series from which this story comes, there was another called \\"Magic: The Gathering\\" using different writers for the separate episodes.  Mark Sumner did THE PRODIGAL SORCERER.  Then, he came up with the series, \\"News From the Edge\\" about a tabloid which is 99% trash.<br /><br />In this one, the female reporter who 'works' for something called 'Global Query,' and sets out to interview a real-live vampire.

The female reporter has much to learn about interviews.  First, with a vampire, you don't stand close enough for him to bite you anywhere.  When's the body disappears completely, she has to wonder had it been a ghost, apparition, or merely a figment of her imagination.  She wants to find some truth out there, but no, this has nothing in common with the \\"Cat Who\\" books, nor George Martin's book about vampires.  Now, that is a scary book.

Unfortunately, while the protagonist's almost unwavering faith and will to survive are inspiring, the core of the novel is hardly redeemed with its barely-there conclusion. This fantastical tale of a young boy and a comically named tiger trapped on a lifeboat is heartwarming at times, but the novel's unbridled visual imagery is not for the weak-stomached.  All in all, the novel's redeeming qualities most definitely outweigh its shortcomings and even if it doesn't change your mind on God, it will at least make you think a little about survival mentality.	2005-10-11

It was a little dull in the beginning but Wick captured  my heart again.I would reccommend this book to any reader who is fascinated by love.	2005-10-11
US	33347828	R56HVH4RAGYP9	0345379063	590264183	Legend (Drenai Tales, Book 1)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Enjoyable read	Legend by David Gemmell is an intriguing tale of a hero from the past coming out of retirement to help fight a battle. This is the first book I have read by Gemmell and can honestly say I will be reading more. Gemmell has a straight forward style that is not over the top, but he has a knack for weaving a great believable story. I never post spoilers in my reviews, but there are two things in this book that I didn't see coming. One positive and one negative, I'll let you decide which is which.<br /><br />The characters are what truly drive this book. While the story is good, the characters are that much better. From Rek and Druss to Bowman and Hogun, they are all believable and all have their flaws that add to the story. Another thing that I found particularly enjoyable was the dialog of the characters. Gemmell has a way of making sure the reader hears different voices in their head as the characters talk. I have been told that character dialect is one of the most difficult things for a writer to do and Gemmell pulls it off with no problems at all. I have read books that are character driven that I have not liked at all, yet with these characters you don't want the book to end.<br /><br />On top of great characters is a pretty straightforward plot, but done in such a way that the reader doesn't know what to expect. I mentioned before the hero of old returns from retirement to fight in this epic battle. I am not one that enjoys reading about these large scale battles, I think they are over done and can be found in to many books, yet the way Gemmell does it he gives the impression of the large scale battle - without all the fluff. There is a little bit of political intrigue but the meat of the story is the battle, holding the keep from the invading army. I wasn't sure if the book could sustain this battle for as long as it did, but when I finished I could easily see how more could have been written about it and still been fine.<br /><br />I have a few `complaints' about this book, one I won't mention because it's a spoiler. But the other is simply that the ending felt rushed to me. The entire book is building up to the end of this massive large scale battle, only once you get there - it seems rushed and a little disjointed. It's not to say it's a bad ending, just that I think it could have been done better and still gotten where the author wanted to go. I think part of this may be due to this being the first book Gemmell had published at the time (1984), but it bugged me a little bit.<br /><br />With all that said, I think if you are a fantasy fan, even a casual fantasy fan at best, you will enjoy this story. I would highly recommend it.' about this book, one I won't mention because it's a spoiler. But the other is simply that the ending felt rushed to me.

[...]    \\"Johnnie and Dorothy met on the show [What's My Line mystery guest segment].\\"  Co-authors Larry and Bonnie Hearn Hill have their characters meet that way, but the Hills' premise demonstrates their ignorance of Hearst news reporting.  I will explain.    The reason Johnnie Ray appeared on What's My Line for the first time was to plug his first movie:  There's No Business Like Show Business.  The year was 1954, and it was a Hollywood creation.   It started production two years after Johnnie first became famous, and that initial fame happened on the Broadway circuit and in jukeboxes.  He sold a record number of tickets at the Copacabana nightclub (a mile away from Broadway but part of the Broadway club circuit) in April 1952 followed by a stint at the Paramount, then a major part of Times Square.    The point is, Johnnie Ray and Dorothy Kilgallen had at least one conversation in the spring of 1952, long before What's My Line united them.  Part of her job was to interview every singer who sold a lot of tickets at those clubs.  Had she neglected this job duty in 1952, her bosses would have lost all faith in her.      Catholic Dorothy's bosses were the Catholic sons of the recently expired William Randolph Hearst Sr., and they hadn't started mismanaging their empire yet.  In 1952 Hearst plus those nightclubs plus Toast of the Town had absolute control over which recording artist became a teen idol.  Johnnie Ray became one; Merv Griffin didn't.  They were almost the same age.     So why would Dorothy Kilgallen pass up a Johnnie Ray interview until he'd toured the world and finished a movie shoot on the Fox lot?  No way.  The authors screwed up this initial incident in their plot.  Selling many tickets at the Paramount by itself warranted interviews with Kilgallen, Sullivan, Winchell, etc.  Were the Hearsts that dumb in 1952?  They had a monopoly on entertainment journalism then.    My reasoning supports the claim of Miami - based comedian George Hopkins.  Nobody has published his eyewitness account of Johnnie and Dorothy meeting at a press party for his new 45 single that sold more copies than any 45 single on the Columbia label up to that time.  Party took place at the old Astor Hotel across the street from the Paramount marquee that shouted \\"Johnnie Ray.\\"  Also present:  Vic Damone, Tony Bennett, Kitty Kallen and many others who passed long ago.    The Hills paint Dorothy's search for Lee Oswald's delusions/accomplices as an obsession that started in November 1963, blocking every other story within her reach.  In truth, she devoted an entire column to the kidnapping and rescue of Frank Sinatra Jr. just weeks after Oswald died.  You don't see any traces of her feud with Frank Sr. in it.  She lambasted TV reporters for asking police officials the wrong questions.  She wanted them to ask why the kidnappers set up the ransom drop at a highway overpass that was well - lit at night.    I'm well aware the Hills always write fiction.  You can see a list of their titles.  Why did they devote their very first novel to transforming a smart, worldly woman into a horny Catholic who sees paths to paradise and conspiracy everywhere?  Bonnie Hearn Hill proves what Shirley Chisholm said about more people picking on her for being a successful woman than for being a successful African American.      Ms. Chisholm and Ms. Kilgallen were New Yorkers and contemporaries, and Ms. Chisholm made her famous observation just a few years after the Voice of Broadway expired.  Sadly, the reality of sexism trumping racism burns brightly in 2005.  When was the last time you read in the Sunday New York Times that James Baldwin was ugly with bulging eyes?  His looks don't matter, but Ms. Kilgallen's weak chin does.      Dorothy referred to James Baldwin during her testimony on behalf of Lenny Bruce's First Amendment rights, but that's yet another episode the Hills ignored while they painted their Kennedy / Marilyn / bisexual chic portrait.  No one ever went broke underestimating ...	2005-10-11

Set in the New York ballet world of the 1980's, the novel is told by three third-person narrators. Sandra is a young and promising ballerina who aches to be recognized by the director of the New York City Ballet - George Balanchine, or Mr. B., as the dancers call him.  Adam, her friend and now lover, dances with the other company in town, the American Ballet Theater, under the direction of Mikhail Baryshnikov.  Finally, Balanchine himself tells a magical segment of the story; although his health is ailing, he wants to direct one more ballet - Sleeping Beauty - and he wants Sandra to be the star and his muse. <br /> <br />Sharp addresses with insight and compassion the artist's eternal debate - how to live in the real world with one's dreams and aspirations, and each character embodies this struggle as the story unfolds.  Sandra must live with the realities of an ill father, a brilliant historian who has battled with mental illness since before Sandra's mother died when she was a child.  Adam must deal with the pressure he receives from his parents, dancers themselves, who provide a stunted kind of support: they love him, but their own dysfunctional relationship and their need to turn away from romantic passion and seek only the passion they can find in art has made them poor role models for their son.  He must learn how to negotiate relationships on his own.  For solace, Adam has always turned to his godfather, Randall, the only one in the family who sees him as a person more than as a body.  Yet Randall is failing, deteriorating from the ravages of Kaposi's sarcoma. <br /> <br />This book investigates in unflinching but breathtaking prose the layers of passion to be navigated by dancers.  There is the romantic and sexual passion that Adam and Sandra share in their desperate attempts to meld their souls while simultaneously trying to extricate themselves from one another.  There is the passion of the dance, the physical passion, in all of its rough and tactile glory.  In one powerful dance scene, Adam has the opportunity to dance with his father, Frankie, in a ballet that his grandfather's lover has created for the three of them - Adam, Frankie, and Sandra.  The scene details the movement of the men's bodies, the etchings that makeup creates in the lines of their faces, the film of sweat their hands slip over when they grasp one another's limbs for their intricate moves.  Adam is at the top of his game, feeling at first intimidated by then energized by his father's presence; he executes his leaps and vaults with passion and precision.  And when Sandra comes out of the wings, he uses that energy to create a dynamo on the stage.  But the experience, Adam realizes, exhilarating as it is, taps into too much emotion since it involves the people he loves.  For the reader, the scene highlights the question of how the artist, in his or her realm, can exert control - over self, over art, over love. <br />  <br />The final level of passion is exemplified by Balanchine himself, as he struggles to transform the vision in his head to the three dimensional world of the studio, and ultimately, the stage.  For his passion, control is also an issue.  He can control the vision of his art, but he can't control his deteriorating body, nor can he control the life of the woman he wants to birth as his final muse. <br /> <br />Adrienne Sharp's First Love offers a multitude of reads from passionate love story to real-life depiction of the dance world, to treatise on the evolution of an artist's vision.  All are deeply satisfying. <br />	2005-10-10

It can be a root to many problems and issues.  Rabbi Twerski is an esteemed rabbi and Pittsburgh-based psychiatrist who is called upon the world over for his opinions.  I was so addicted (a good addiction) to this book, I had to buy two more copies, because I kept loaning out my other copies to friends.  There are over 200 questions and answers in this book covering issues including marriage, medicine, anxiety, 9/11 trauma, child rearing, chronic discontent, causeless hatred (sinas chinam), jealousy, pettiness, shalom bayit, retirement woes, depression, bi-polarity, addiction, an immature spouse, a paranoid shulmate, emotional dependecies, issues with parents and in-laws (who goes for help, the person with the headache or the person who causes the headache?), issues of self esteem, issues of hashkafah (perspective/ideology), dyselxia, and shidduchim.  You learn a lot; it is a tiny bit voyeuristic; and if you are like me, you will find yourself disagreeing with him in some cases, and finding him Solomonic in other cases.<br /><br />Some of my favorite questions were: One \\"BT\\" asks why he is being discriminated against for a shidduch even though he is a great student (is it his perception, or something different?)  An educated questioner is frustrated that no one listens to him/her (is it the ideas, or the way they are presented).  May a shul move from a deteriorated neighborhood to a new suburb if it will leave older congregants without a house of worship?  Can a rabbi recuse himself of giving advice to a nudnick if he has a vested emotional interest in the outcome?  What if a teen crosses the street rather than walk quickly past an older slower walker so as not to embarrass them, but actually cuase them to feel ostracized?  Why would Rabbi Twerski discourage the use of tranquilizers by a widow or widower to overcome shiva grief?  What should one do if their husband is beloved in the community, but a tyrant at home? What if one's father abandoned the family and now wants to come to the daughter's wedding since she is marrying into a prestigious family?  How can one overcome exam anxiety?  Is marriage a hospital (will a shidduch solve emotional issues)?  Must you honor a parent who calls you derogatory names?  If a wife likes nail polish and her husband does not (due to religious reasons) , but the wife feels pretty with it on, but her husband doesn't, what should they do?  If you act like a doormat, will people (or your daughter in law) wipe their feet on you all the time?

You can tell she abhors abortion...she rails against abortion through her characters in many of her books, but she seems to have a peculiar fascination, actually , obesession with betrayals and extramarital affairs. Its almost like she is living out some fantasy. In most of her books that I have read, the main characters are usually attached in some form to someone else (silken web, led astray etc.) and we are supposed to like them and relate to them. I had the same problem here. How is 7 years of solitude a penance for not just betraying your fiance but being responsible for his death as well. I notice that she really doesnt explain away or attempt to resolve this moral dilema that confronts readers when they are required to relate to and sympathasize/ excuse such transgressions on the part of the main characters. I have noticed this element creeping up even in her secondary characters (the hero's dad has a mistress by the side etc...Mirror image, Hidden Fires). I dont know why she has to resort to that. A book is so much more enjoyable when these issues dont have to be dealt with....and when the main characters do not have moral failings. isnt that the idea behind a romance novel? I used to enjoy her romances but now, I ave checked out completely and hae moved on to other authors.	2005-10-10

Does WizKids even care about their customers?	This book should have come with an adult content warning.  It reminds me of a cross between Silence of the Lambs and ShowGirls if they were written by a 10th grader.  The main characters are either psychotic or perverted.  I dispute a previous reviewer's opinion that the content of the book is acceptable because the MechWarrior universe is targeted at adults.  The fiction and games (video and miniatures) are equally, if not more appealing to kids. The blatant homosexuality alone in the book makes it unacceptable for that audience; parents should be forewarned.  In addition, the author has taken great liberties with established characters.  For instance, Antonia Chinn, a miniatures character, is supposed to be a reluctant follower of Katana Tormark.  Instead she has been repainted as her Tormark's lesbian devotee.   As for the author's writing style, it is also weak.  The author heavily peppers the text with Japanese vocabulary which adds nothing to the content while at the same time, has characters that should live and die by their courtesan formality and honor, talking like teenage boys in a locker room.  Hopefully, I will soon forget all about this book.  For now, how do I get my money back?	2005-10-10

Volume II contains The Thousand Cities, which is told from the Marukaner General Abivard's point of view, and Videssos Besieged, which is told by his counterpart (and foe) the Videssian Emperor. Abivard has come  up in the world since the first book in the series (see Time of Troubles I for The Stolen Throne).  Now the General to King Sharbaraz, Abivard finds his problems have gotten more difficult.  While he has successfully invaded all the Westlands of Videssos, he cannot find a way to cross the sea into the capital.  Meanwhile the Videssan army is now striking back, using their navy to place troops wherever they wish.  King Sharbaraz expects Abivard to win more and more battles while offering fewer resources and troops.  And his wife Roshnani, while always offering able counsel, contines to urge big changes in Marukan society.   <br /> <br />Videssos Besieged is again told by now-Emperor Maniakes, who is losing support as the war continues to falter.  Tax revenues are almost non-existant with the Marukan army occupying most of the West, and the Kubrati invading from the North.  Now he's losing the support of the priests and the people for committing incest; he married his first cousin and he's quite happy about it.  Turtledove shows us his background as a technical writer in spending far too long describing a magical spell in forging a document that's just a fantasy version of cut and paste using an actual (squeak!) mouse. <br /> <br />Once again the books closely follow the history of the Byzantine Empire, with magic overlayed here and there. This is the same formula, history meets fantasy, used in the Darkness series (which retold World War II as a sword and sorcery epic) and the Peachtree trilogy (The US Civil War). Turtledove, as always, does it well. <br /> <br />I can't give the book (the two novels) five stars because the characters are too similar to Turtledove's other heroes: logical-thinking straight-talking types married to women much like themselves. The characters observe repeatedly that war kills people, that women do battle in the birthing bed, and that people are people the world over. The books are enjoyable but don't make the leap to profound.	2005-10-10

Although new to this author I've read a few of her earlier works and truly enjoyed her take on historical figures and the stories she created around them.  With that said I feel that Ms. Gregory's latest effort \\"The Virgin's Lover\\" although entertaining was a tad of a let down.  Perhaps due to the fact that it's a story about Queen Elizabeth and there are so many preconceived ideas about this amazing woman that creating a story for her cheats the reader.<br /><br />The story revolves around the love triangle of the young queen Elizabeth, Robert Dudley, and Dudley's wife Amy.  There was always a connection between Elizabeth and Robert that neither could admit to or act on.  Despite this their relationship grows, changes and although Elizabeth loves Robert she draws the line at allowing him to rule as King.  She'd rather he rule as Queen's Consort.  On the otherside of this coin is Robert and his wife Amy.  Amy is a Catholic and although she practices in secret a divorce from Robert is not in the cards.  Elizabeth feeling torn turns to her trusted advisor William Cecil looking for help.  Cecil has no love for Dudley and he knows that it would be bad policy if he was made King.  But he is more concerned with the fact that the Dudley family historically has participated in treasonous activities and that Roberts love for Elizabeth may not be the best thing for the young queen.  After all an ambitious man will do almost anything to see that he gets what he want's.  When love, a countries best interests, and a secret meet...nothing good can come from it.  What will Elizabeth do when faced with this situation and William Cecil's plans to put it to rest?<br /><br />Historically speaking it's difficult to put twists and turns on events that truly happened.  The creativity then come from the concept of \\"what if...\\" and I feel that this is where Ms. Gregory started her plotting.  This is a fantistical love triangle that truly existed.  Robert Dudley was the Queens favorite and this is historically understood.  Perhaps this is why this story fell flat.  No matter how hard you try...you just can't re-write history.  Ms. Gregory though does an amazing job of bringing to life, the court, the time period, and her characters Robert and Elizabeth. The reader will truly feel the angst of this love triangle.  Come to this read with an open mind and the reader should do just fine.  Forget what you were taught and just enjoy this work of fiction as it stands.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designsand this is historically understood.

I did some of the exercises and I will do more. Mainly, it's Andy's love of words and his ability to construct sentences that make perfect sense while at the same time sing, in a zany kind of way, that I found inspiring. After playing in these pages, you just gotta write something.	2005-10-10

And then, finally, it's undersized in that the ending falls flat, because the title character's redemption is telescoped from page one.  But, with all that, it's pretty much a good read because Gregory David Roberts knows, loves, and can write about Bombay specifically, and India in general, and takes us places in India's heart we'd never get to on our own.	2005-10-10

Even my Danish friends wanted this book so they could understand their own grammar. Its perfect for beginners and a great reference book for more advanced speakers of this often times difficult language. The only problem with this book (and the reason why I gave it 4 stars) is that it is written in very high formal British English, which is different from formal American English. This can often times confuse the reader, but not to a large extent. All in all, this is an excellent book and well worth the price. I plan on using this book the rest of my life (and the rest of my exchange year here in Denmark).	2005-10-10

Any fan of military aeronautics is going to be floored at the detail he has encluded; from weoponry to the way they travel between the planets.  It seems like there really may be people colonizing the moon and they are way ahead of us Earth dwellers- and they are from Earth.  Never underestimate brilliant children as they play a large part in the running of this extraordinary society.  If those people come down one day asking for the world to acknowledge their right to ownership of the moon I wouldn't fight it.  They can make it very uncomfortible for us down here and they wouldn't even have to kill anyone!

At the outset I have to say that I have been an avid John Irving fan since I read Setting Free the Bears, and Owen Meany to me was the embodiment of why people write novels, and why we should read them.  <br />This latest offering from Mr Irving doesn't live up to most of his previous work. I reckon this is him trying to exorcise some fairly unpleasant ghosts from his own life, if a recent TV interview is anything to go by. UIFY needed a strong editor to whittle it down as there is much that is repetitive, both within the text and drawn from previous material. The idea of distorted memory and the accounts of the tattooing were genuinely engaging, and the abuse angle was a disturbing but realistic plot line but the overplaying of a a device never works in the long run. <br /> <br />There were only a few glimpses of the achingly funny and witty writer that Mr Irving can be, and his attention to detail is undimmed, but again, sometimes less would have been a good idea. <br /> <br />Emma was a great character, but Jack I grew tired of and the end wasn't an ending, rather a stop. <br /> <br />I had hoped for so much, and feel let down. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10
US	52120786	RVZ88K4LR45BO	0756402190	460694079	1: Shadowmarch: Shadowmarch: Volume I	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Hooked by the end	I'll start off by saying that William's \\"Memory, Sorrow and Thorn\\" series is one of my favorite fantasy series of all times. I'm probably a bit biased, because before I started reading Shadowmarch I really WANTED to love it. <br /> <br />The first half of the novel I couldn't help but seeing how some characters in Shadowmarch were simply COPIES of other characters in MST. There was the mysterious doctor who was knowledged in the arts of magic (Morgenes, Chaven), the small humble man who only wanted to help (Tiamak, Chert), the strong independent princess (Miriamele,Briony), and even a non-human  woman leading the opposing forces.....etc.  It wasn't until the midway point of the book that characters began developing a little more uniqueness, and that the plotline began to pick up a bit more. If you can make it that far into the book, the rest of it is a joy to read. <br /> <br />Other things that made this book intersting. The \\"bad guys\\" in Shadowmarch were much more well developed compared to MST. We're not given much information about them, but already I can see that they're not all that bad. They've been wronged in the past, and only trying to fight for what they lost. This is much more interesting then the typical bad guy. The other \\"bad guy\\" in Shadowmarch is the autarch. He, in typical bad guy fashion, already seems to be completely evil. It will be interesting to see what happens with that end of the plotline.  <br /> <br />All in all, the first half of the book was a bit of a disapointment, but Williams made up for it in the second half of the book. If you don't mind a bit weak character development for a few hundred pages while the story is being set up for the rest of the series, I think you will enjoy reading this.	2005-10-10

For Jessie Holland and Erin Delahanty, the chance to live out a real life \\"what if\\" presents itself.<br /><br />Writer Jess is in going nowhere relationship with a single father not willing to commit; innkeeper Erin's husband just left her and their teenage daughter after a quarrel. While commiserating with her editor, Jess jokingly mentions that she and Erin should change lives. Her editor, seeing an interesting story hook makes it happen and soon Jess is back in her small Arizona hometown avoiding the fianc&eacute; she left at the altar while Erin is pounding the pavement in the Big Apple looking for a job for a novice chef. Erin's daughter encourages her mother's trip, hoping to bring her parents back to each other.<br /><br />This is just the separation that Jess needs from her boyfriend Jonathon - she figures that her absence will make his heart grow fonder. She does not count on falling for a sexy environmentalist. Meanwhile, Erin gets a job as a production assistant on a cooking show, and when the co-host is a no-show, she fills in and makes quite a splash.  Soon she is filling in as host of another cooking show while the regular host is on maternity leave. Her upstairs neighbor shows more than a passing interest, which she does not want to act on, even is she believes that her estranged husband Skip has been unfaithful.<br /><br />\\"Otherwise Engaged\\" is a bittersweet tale cautioning that you ought to be careful what you wish for. Neither protagonist leaves a particularly thorny situation, but their continued absence from the ones they love could result in more than thorns.	2005-10-10

By killing off Helen Clyde (surely this is no longer a spoiler) she seems decided to make either the perpetually aggrieved Barbara Havers or the dreary Simon/Deborah couple the centerpiece of any future books - even though earlier books that didn't feaure Lynley have sold dramatically less well.  It looks like her absorption with \\"growing as an author\\" has caused her to badly misjudge why people bought her books.  Witness ended on a dark and dreary note that only bodes ill for future books.  I recommend that George fans start looking for another favorite author.	2005-10-10

Riley <br /> <br />This book is less than impressive. It exhumes the need for elucidated text in the field of computer science. <br /> <br />I am compelled to correlate this book with the awkward ramblings of Vizzini to Westley in the movie, \\"The Princess Bride\\". <br /> <br />Reading this book was more than a slight burden. Only one who is versed in reading the writings of such authors as Joseph Cambell or Henry David Thoreau can comprehend the confusion of word and sputter heavily peppering this book.  <br /> <br />Allow me to illuminate: <br /> <br />1) This author finds it fit to include typos and syntax errors in the example code as to completely change the meaning of the code. Only one already experienced in programming will catch such errors. Others will wallow in confusion as to why the program is not working properly, after all, they copied it from the book word for word, it should be working, right? <br /> <br />2) In several instances, the author uses programming syntax and variable naming methods in his text that has nothing to do with the code explaination at hand. He actively titles the beginning of each sub-section as if it were a class or variable. IE: DivisionOfRadians()  <br />NO THAT'S NOT A CLASS! :D <br />This is a common practice of David D. Rileys throughout the book, and not only for chapter sub-sections. He uses such writing methods all too liberally. <br /> <br />3) This genius author also uses an arbitrary library called aLibrary. Good for him, he designed his own library! Since this whole book is based on the aLibrary, any real world application have just been made void. I mean seriously, try convincing your co-workers that this aLibrary is the next big thing. What happened to the commonly used AWT and Swing libraries? Hmmm, oh, it's shoved in the back index. Right where you would expect commonly used every day libraries. <br /> <br />4) His code snippets and actual text are seperated by font style. Only problem is, you can't tell at all. His method of referring to code, methods, arguments, classes etc in his text is extremely easy to miss without paying impossibly close attention. His text is filled with inconsistencies and problems. I DO NOT recommend this book. If at all possible, avoid it entirely. For those of you who are using this book as a college text, well, all I can say is, I'm very sorry. <br /> <br />On the bright side, his explaination of objects and classes is ... decent.	2005-10-10

Usually, you learn about the E-field first, solve a lot of problems and develop a really solid familiarity with it.  Then, once you're really familiar with the E-field, you can move on to magnetic fields and make analogies between H-fields and E-fields.  This is impossible with Dr. Rao's approach, because he introduces electric and magnetic fields almost simultaneously.  So, you wind up getting less insight into what the E-field is; and this prevents you from fully understanding H-fields, which are more complicated (because of the cross-products, right-hand rules, etc.).  My advice: stay away, and go with a book that gives you a more traditional approach: electrostatics, magnetostatics, then dynamic electromagnetic fields.  Hope this helps.	2005-10-10

Am I the only reader who felt that Ms. Reichl's fascination with disguises bordered on creepiness?  Perhaps I'm naive, but is theatrical make-up, a wig and a new wardrobe absolutely required in order to mask the identity of a newspaper food critic?  Did it sound perhaps like Ms. Reichl had perhaps a bit too much time on her hands?  Was it absolutely necessary that she create long and detailed lies to tell complete strangers (the manicurist and unsuspecting dining companion Dan Green)simply to write a compelling restaurant review?  I think not.  It seems she simply enjoyed playing dress up and putting one over on everyone.   <br /> <br />All in all, I couldn't get past the author's odd behavior to appreciate her talent as a food critic.  While I did enjoy Tender At The Bone, this is certainly a book I would skip.  As another reviewer here mentioned, many parts of it felt contrived, exaggerated and perhaps, with Ms. Reichl's penchant for creating an elaborate ruse, simply untrue.	2005-10-10

Why, Cannie is so special and unique that she doesn't even need a standard nickname.  I don't think she rejected \\"Candy\\" because she felt it would invite taunts over her size, I believe she felt it was too pedestrian for someone as educated, witty and ambitious as herself. <br /> <br />Throughout the book Cannie disparages: black people, the uneducated, lesbians, those who have the misfortune of being thin and most curiously, secretaries.  When Bruce describes the new girlfriend that he inevitably began dating after Cannie told him it was over, she picks her apart in her mind:  \\"Great, older, poorer, more dependent, less intelligent.  I was dying to ask if she was blonde too, just to make the run of clichs complete\\" This she laments about a 31 year old kindergarten teacher who attended, gasp, Montclair State.  Or let us contemplate this passage: \\"Saturday morning in late November,  the kind of day where it looks like everyone with means and money has fled the city and gone to the Bahamas...and the streets are populated with the people they'd left behind:  pock marked delivery boys, black girls with braids, scruffy looking dreadlocked white kids on bikes.  Secretaries.  Japanese tourists.  A guy with a wart on his chin...\\"  So, essentially, the scenery that depresses Cannie is populated with blacks, Asians and working class people.  Yeah, that Cannie, boy, she is a breath of (bigoted) fresh air! <br /> <br />Also, while one's heritage is important and should most definitely be commented upon, must every individual with importance in Cannie's life be Jewish?  Obviously, as Asians, African Americans and the working class bum Cannie out. <br /> <br />Also, after reading \\"In Her Shoes\\" I noticed a theme to Ms. Weiner's characters: overweight, self depreciating, highly successful and knows it yet not entirely sure, ignoring the advances of the \\"most perfect guy in the world\\" because she isn't worthy of love but I'm better than all these other chicks, right?, heroine.  With a younger, thinner hotter sister who is a loser, alkie, slutty slacker.  With an evil step parent.  And dogs are featured somewhere. <br /> <br />If you like formulaic fiction with fairy tale endings, this one is for you.  I have read better, with more likable characters.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-10

(And death.) The first surprise was-- Hastings' stories contain humor--something you don't expect in a funeral instruction book. (How many funny undertakers do you know?) That's one thing that makes the book wonderful--it's full of the unexpected. But it's never irreverent, either. Hastings talks straight from the heart, which is the only way you can deal with funerals anyway. I first opened up to \\"Appendix A\\"...where her flow chart begins with...\\"Has someone died? -Yes - No.\\" Even though I came upon this book just days after my mother died, I thought-Wow! This writer DEFINITELY has my attention. So this book is more than a \\"How To\\" book. It's a look ahead (to a place where most of us go kicking and screaming), but Hastings guides us gently along a path we know we must someday walk. She has a special touch. Her book is sensible, genuine-it's almost like a memoir in that it takes you to personal places you've never before gone to, but really need to visit. My advice:  take the trip with Hastings. It's the least expensive, most gently humorous, most intelligent walk you'll take with ANYBODY down that valley. (Plus, you'll learn a lot.)	2005-10-10

While this novel picks up the \\"Never Ending War\\" generations later, the characters are new, and the situation is very different.<br /><br />Friedman uses the old twins separated at birth plot as central to this episodic work dealing with the overthrow of a tyrant. Less a novel than a series of incidents that coalesce at the end, the point of view keeps shifting, even within chapters sometimes.<br /><br />With this author, there are always complications, and you need to be on the alert for foreshadowings and surprises. You need to keep careful track of the characters, too--fortunately there's a glossary to help out.<br /><br />Friedman writes well, and she creates fascinating characters, all of whom become pawns in a game that's greater than they know. I hope it doesn't take another 15 years before the author drops back into this universe.	2005-10-10

If you start by reading the Publisher's Weekly review, you might prefer a poke in the eye with a sharp stick to reading Ghost of the White Nights, and that would be a mistake!<br /><br />The concluding volume of the Columbia-Ghost trilogy is Modesitt's best volume in the series.  It is well-paced, start to finish, it has some interesting plot twists, and the hero, Johan Eschbach, is at his finest.<br /><br />Fans of the series will already understand the basic premise.  Columbia, an alternate-world semi-USA faces the twin threats of chronic oil shortages and Austrian Emperor Ferdinand's plots to dominate the world. Eschbach, spy, professor, war hero, and good guy who wipes the dishes and makes a fair salad, must handle both issues.<br /><br />This time, Eschbach must broker a deal with a creaky Romanov regime, trading technology for oil.  There is plenty of intrigue, and Modesitt really has the Russian character-- proud, paranoid, but ultimately somehow likeable--down pat.<br /><br />It is a shame that Eschbach's ahem--itchy-ahem French wife is still along for the ride, fussing about every bowl of soup, but if you can get past that, White Nights isn't bad at all.  Some odd plot twists like having Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel appear in the alternate universe as an insidiously smarmy US Ambassador to Russia, are a lot of fun, too.<br /><br />White Nights is a significant uptick on the previous volume, Ghost of the Revelator, which had almost nothing in it but the French wife crabbing about the chow!	2005-10-10

Jones, professor of philosophy in California. This series is a very strong, thorough introduction to the course of Western Philosophy, beginning at the dawn of the philosophical enterprise with the pre-Socratics in ancient Greece to the modern thinkers such as Wittgenstein and Sartre. It has grown, over the three decades or so of its publication, from one to four then to five volumes. It has remained a popular text, and could serve as the basis of a one-year survey of philosophy for undergraduates or a one-semester survey for graduate students. Even advanced students in philosophy will find this valuable, all major topics and most minor topics in the course of philosophy are covered in these volumes.<br /><br />Jones states that there are two possible ways for a writer to organise a history of philosophy -- either by addressing everyone who ever participated in philosophy (which could become rather cumbersome if one accepts the premise that anyone could be a philosopher), or to address the major topics and currents of thought, drawing in the key figures who address them, but leaving out the lesser thinkers for students to pursue on their own. Jones has chosen the latter tactic, making sure to provide bibliographic information for this task.<br /><br />This volume, 'Kant and Nineteenth Century', starts where the last volume leaves off, as philosophy is coming of age as a discipline removed from the direct control and overarching influence of the church and, to a lesser extent, the politics of those in governmental authority. The world of the Renaissance and Reformation gave way to a world of continuing renovation and revolution, in America most notably as a start, and then throughout the rest of the Western Hemisphere and through Europe in many places.<br /><br />The period of the Enlightenment, the few centuries following the Renaissance and Reformation, is often called the Age of Reason. To a large extent, the historical presence of the church was withdrawing, and the dominance in intellectual and social circles of a humanist, empirical and rationalist mode was now firmly established. By the time of the nineteenth century, however, the confidence in the rationalist model was beginning to wane, with nothing clearly taking its place (this has continued into the twentieth century). Onto this stage, the first major thinker to emerge was Immanuel Kant, a wide-ranging thinker whose greatest contributions were probably in the field of knowledge, reason, ethics and metaphysics.<br /><br />Kant became the standard by which other philosophers would be measured. Hegel and Schopenhauer both dealt with responses to and reactions against Kantian ideas. Hegel's though became a standard by which history itself would be measured as a discipline. Following quickly was the rise of the Utilitarianists, Comte and Marx (whose ideas would not see their fullest political expression until the twentieth century). In Europe, the century culminates in Kierkegaard and Nietzsche (whose philosophy also influenced twentieth century politics, having been co-opted by the National-Socialists of Germany). Meanwhile America was beginning to produce philosophers, such as C.S. Pierce and William James. Jones also includes a relatively unknown philosopher, F.H. Bradley, who is little known outside of philosophical circles, but was important continuing the Hegelian legacy into the twentieth century.<br /><br />Each volume ends with a glossary of terms, and a worthwhile index. The glossary warns against short, dictionary-style definitions and answers to broad terms and questions, and thus indicates the pages index-style to the discussion within the text for further context. The one wish I would have would be a comprehesive glossary and index that covers the several volumes; as it is, each volume has only its own referents.<br /><br />This is minor criticism in a generally exceptional series. It is not easy text, but it is not needlessly difficult. The print size on the direct quotes, which are sometimes lengthy, can be a strain at times, but the reading is worthwhile.. <br /> <br />This is minor criticism in a generally exceptional series.

In that book, Plato set up the ideal city-state, with classes born and bred to specific functions and roles in society, and a sense of philosophical outlook consistent across the board.  However, such a society was unlikely to be brought out, in Plato's time and, as it turned out, in any other.<br /><br />Plato tried at different times to persuade rulers to become his envisioned philosopher-king; the last attempt was with a tyrant of Syracuse, who in the end imprisoned Plato rather than following his directions.  Plato wrote this work, 'The Laws', as the last of his dialogues.  Its difference from the Republic is immediately apparent in the absence of Socrates as a character - Plato at the end of his life has finally taken to working in his own right and not through a proxy.<br /><br />Just looking at the contents will show the breadth of this work - it involves practically every aspect of civil society:  legislative bodies (and Plato has some scathing commentaries on some that he has known); education and its proper role and method (including even drinking parties as part of the educational process); ideas of monarchy, democracy, and the balance of power (some American constitutional ideas were generated from a reading (and occasional misreading) of this work); civil administration; arts and sciences; military and sports training; sexual conduct; economics; criminal law, torts, and judicial process; religion and theology; civil law, property and family law; Plato even argues for the need of a 'nocturnal council', one that delves not only into the practical aspects of the law, but also their philosophical bases.<br /><br />According to translator and editor Trevor Saunders, 'The reader of the Republic who picks up the Laws is likely to have difficulty in believing that the same person wrote both.'  Saunders speculates that Plato in his older years changed from optimism to pessimism, from idealism to realism, but that this is not all there is to the assumption, because in actual fact the transition from the Republic to the Laws involves transitioning unattainable ideals to attainable realities.<br /><br />Plato describes the construction of a utopian society in great detail, down to the number of citizens permitted to live in the city (5040) and the length of time foreigners might reside in the city (20 years).  This shows that Plato considers politics to be an exact science (indeed, despite the inclusion of the 'nocturnal council', he did see his system of laws being essentially unalterable through history).  Plato is not averse to the use of force and coercion to set up and maintain the utopian society.  Finally, Plato sees a self-contained kind of society that is likely to become xenophobic to the extreme, with less tolerance toward its own citizens than toward those foreigners permitted to live and work in the city.  Indeed, for the virtuous citizens to be free to pursue their virtue, the majority of the manual work and crafts must be done by a worker class composed of slaves or immigrant workers, or both.<br /><br />Plato's Laws suffer from much greater criticism in the modern world than the Republic, in part because it is a more 'realistic' work, with a reality that no longer applies.  However, many of his insights are worthwhile, and the overall structure of his society reflected in the Laws is worth discussion as much as is that of the Republic.  One of the problems with this work vis-a-vis the Republic is its length (the Laws is considerable longer); another problem is that it lacks the dramatic reading possible from the Republic, rather the difference between a political debate and a legal seminar.  Still, it is an important work, showing how Plato's thought had shifted in his lifetime.der years changed from optimism to pessimism, from idealism to realism, but that this is not all there is to the assumption, because in actual fact the transition from the Republic to the Laws involves transitioning unattainable ideals to attainable realities.   <br /> <br />Plato describes the construction of a utopian society in great detail, down to the number of citizens permitted to live in the city (5040) and the length of time foreigners might reside in the city (20 years).

It is interesting to see his ideas as they started and others he later refuted presented. <br /> <br />The other angle is the ideas contained here need to be considered in their context.  The presentation of this material in 1938/9 would have been difficult at best but that also figures into the rejections it received.

Magnor's book \\"Video-Based Rendering\\" provides an in-depth introduction to the emerging field of real-time video-based rendering (VBR). This book is suited for general audiences with scientific background as well as graduate students in this field.     The text is clearly structured. The preface and the introduction give a broad overview of VBR and point towards possible future applications in everyday life. The first chapter provides a basic motivation for VBR, while the second chapter lays the groundwork in terms of technical hardware and basic image reconstruction algorithms. The detailed discussion of image based rendering proves especially useful for the understanding of the various VBR algorithms that follow in chapters 3-6. The book concludes with an outlook on novel applications based on VBR as well as required technological advances needed to make real-time VBR a reality.    Each chapter starts with a brief motivation and summary of the topic that is being discussed. Technical terms are clearly defined and frequently cross-referenced throughout the book. In Appendix A these terms are defined separately for additional clarity. Each section begins with a general intuitive overview of the topic and gradually progresses towards more and more complex ideas. Magnor's clear language and his vast number of references throughout the book allow the reader to get an in-depth look into the current state of the art in VBR. Multiple figures allow the reader to visualize the concepts discussed. [...]    I strongly recommend this book as both an accessible and in-depth introduction to VBR as well as a useful resource for graduate students and scientists in the field.	2005-10-10

Just when I thought this was a long wait, in strolls my favorite twosome and third(lover/wife) favorite again to astound, excite, puzzle, and delight the audience of fans, and even beginning with this book-- would anyone not go immediately back and read the other?  Of course!  Because of this wonderful  English-writing author, and I mean wonderful, as I have read them all including the US variety which she stands as a beacon in the darkness. Thomas and Barbara will never change, and thus, their constancy is the defining factor in every new mystery.  Indeed, this is what keeps bringing us back, over and over and over again.

In the story a family decides to visit the art museum (presumably for the first time) and the book follows their visit through the museum with complaints and good times.  Even though there are complaints in the beginning, everyone is glad they visited the museum in the end.  The book is very low on actual content.  The writing is done through the bubbles of each person speaking.  There is no real information about the art or a museum and how to visit one.  Since I have worked for art museums most of my life, I would have like to see something with more helpful information or some educational content along with the fun conversation between the family members otherwise when you have read it once, there is no reason to ever pick it up again.	2005-10-10

Rene Descartes is often considered the founding father of modern philosophy. A true Renaissance man, he studied Scholastic philosophy and physics as a student, spent time as a volunteer soldier and traveler throughout Europe, studied mathematics, appreciated the arts, and became a noted correspondent with royals and intellectual figures throughout the continent. He died in Sweden while on assignment as tutor to the Queen, Christiana.<br /><br />Descartes 'Discourse on Method' is a fascinating text, combining the newly-invented form of essay (Descartes was familiar with the Essays of Montaigne) with the same kind of autobiographical impulse that underpins Augustine's Confessions. Descartes writes about his own form of mystical experience, seeing this as almost a kind of revelation that all past knowledge would be superseded, and all problems would eventually be solved by human intellect.<br /><br />In the Discourse, Descartes formulates logical principles based on reason (which makes it somewhat ironic that this came to him almost as a revelation). Descartes had some appreciation for thinkers such as Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes, but he thought that Bacon depended too much upon empirical data, and with Hobbes he disagreed on what would be the criteria for ascertaining certainty.<br /><br />Descartes was a mathematician at heart, and perhaps had a carry-over of Pythagorean mystical attachment to mathematics, for his sense of reason led him to impute an absolute quality to mathematics; this has major implications for metaphysics and epistemology. Descartes method was a continuation in many ways of the ideas of Plato, Aristotle and the medieval thinkers, for they all tended toward thinking in absolute, universal terms in some degree.<br /><br />Descartes in his first section discounts much of Scholasticism, stating that the only real absolutes are theology and mathematics; because theology is based upon revelation, it is therefore beyond reason, and thus, mathematics becomes the only rational truth. Descartes develops this idea further with rules of method, which include ideas of intuition, analysis and deduction. He uses some of his method to come up with his greatest proposition:<br /><br />Cogito ergo sum - - I think, therefore I am<br /><br />'The Cogito is a first principle from which Descartes will now deduce all that follows.' This permits Descartes to deal both with rational elements and empirical data.<br /><br />This is an important text, one that I read the summer before I went to college, and makes a good study for those who wish to see the personal element in the development of philosophy.mathematics becomes the only rational truth.

This book should have been called \\"The science of tectonic plates, geological and philosophical musings and the history of the San Francisco earthquake considered while on a road trip.\\" <br />Sound appealing?  If so, this might be a good book for you.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, I purchased this book pretty much exclusively with an interest in human stories and events related to the San Francisco earthquake.  The net result for me was a bloated, verbose, meandering narrative maze that was entirely unsatisfying. <br /> <br />I was worried I had made a bad purchase halfway through the never-ending prologue in which the author indicates he is taken with the gaia theory that the earth as a whole can be defined as a living entity. <br /> <br />The author came off as in love with the sound of his own voice (or was he being paid by the word?). I was offended at what amounted to a cheap shot that the author took at the religious paradigm of people in prior centuries.   Reflecting on the huge Lisbon earthquake several centuries prior, he noted that the unsophisticated people present lacked the intellectual capacity to understand the earthquake in any other way than \\"God caused it.\\"  A historian is supposed to consider his or her subjects within the context of their own times and not condescendingly refer their inferiority. <br /> <br />I read the author's book \\"The Professor and the Madman\\" and enjoyed it.

This book might be the first one available to deal with the (inside of the) wine business, it is definitely not a good one. <br /> <br />Being an M.Sc. B.A. by education, a teacher of managerial accounting by profession and a wine buff, I think I am able to comment on the quality of most chapters.  <br /> <br />To begin with, there is considerable overlap between chapters when it comes to (e.g.) the discussion of the U.S. three-tier distribution system and of the financial peculiarities of the industry.  <br /> <br />More importantly, the contributing authors mostly fail to deliver new insights to the business, as you may expect from either professionals or academics in relevant fields. <br /> <br />Somehow it gives the impression of a rush job, not well thought through and not well edited.

The message of being present and liberating oneself from the imprisonment of thought is largely the same, but the format of this book is more compact and accessible and also places Tolle's message in more specific contexts. <br /> <br />In \\"Stillness Speaks\\", Eckhart Tolle replaces the Q&A format found in \\"The Power of Now\\" with a direct and pithy narrative style modeled on Sutras. The first chapter essentially provides the book's entire message while subsequent ones place that message in more specific contexts such as how to bring stillness, awareness, and compassion to work or relationships. <br /> <br />This book, like its predecessor contains much truth. It is the kind of truth that you don't really have to think about because either you'll recognize it intuitively or you won't. While I found both \\"Stillness Speaks\\" and \\"The Power of Now\\" to be useful, powerful books, I was also a little put off by the author's subtle tone of righteous arrogance. A small but significant amount of the \\"energy\\" in each book is directed toward establishing Tolle's credentials as a guru. This, along with the intense sales and marketing found on his home page, seems wasteful, contradictory, and unnecessary.  <br /> <br />Despite, these misgivings, I highly recommend this book for its invaluable teachings. The message has always bee here regardless of who continues to bring it or how it arrives. I understand that Tolle's next book is about bringing consciousness to one's flatulent behavior and that its title will be \\"Stillness Squeaks\\".	2005-10-10

Williams-Sonoma's `Kitchen Companion' is at least as good or better than books I have seen from similar commercial enterprises such as Home Depot and Smith and Hawken. The stated object of the book is to make up for the fact that fewer and fewer people learn how to cook at their mother's (or grandmother's) apron strings.<br /><br />While the subtitle, `The A to Z Guide to Everyday Cooking Equipment & Ingredients' gives the impression of a dictionary approach, the straight alphabetical organization is compromised by a second objective to make the book interesting to pick up and read in your armchair instead of simply being a reference when you want to noodle your way through an unfamiliar recipe, tool, or ingredient. Thus, the book is organized much more like an encyclopedia with big articles on group subjects. Thus, instead of thirty (30) articles on individual herbs, there is one article on `Herbs' covering all common varieties.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this organization, so it is important enough to point this out for your consideration.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the material in the articles, I believe it is very high, although just a bit conventional now and then. For example, the article on microwave ovens says everything you would expect it to say, including the warning that when you double the volume of food, cooking time will also double. What it does not say is how inconvenient it is to use a microwave oven for certain tasks and how careful you have to be with your timing. Similarly, the article on how to make an omelet covers all the basics and firmly distinguishes the omelet from scrambled eggs or any other egg dish, and provides reasonably good diagrams, albeit a bit small and hard on the eyes. On the other hand, the article on the omelet covers much less than many good treatments I have seen.<br /><br />In considering whether to buy this book, you must ask `For what information would I go to this book before going to `Larousse Gastronomique', `The Joy of Cooking', or Shirley Corriher's `Cookwise'? Of course, if you have none of these books, you will go to what you have. And, as a standin for these other books, this one is pretty good, especially for the relatively low list price.<br /><br />If you have no other general cooking references and you are new to cooking, this may be one of the two or three best books to get. If you already own twenty cookbooks and have been cooking for at least a few years, you may want to pass on this, as I would if I were not reviewing it.<br /><br />The book has a decent bibliography, but I think it would have been far, far better to have put references to other books at the end of each individual article. Then, this book would have been a uniquely valuable encyclopedia, extending our horizons far beyond its covers.tronomique', `The Joy of Cooking', or Shirley Corriher's `Cookwise'?

I LOVED \\"Summer of my German Soldier\\" and couln't wait to read the sequal.  But once it was over I felt the book was very structured.  If you have read this book and was dissapointed you can probobly relate.Even though the detailed emotions were good.  The book only mentioned Anton a few times, plus Patty liked lost the gold ring because she didnt wear it or even mention it.  Almost everything Anotn had taught her was gone.  The she meets Roger in Paris and almost half the book takes place there.  But in my opinion Roger is a JERK and Patty is so desperate for love and to selfish and proud to take Ruth's so she goes for the first good looking thing that comes along.  There is also only 1 chapter on Anton's family and Patty only spends about 10 minutes there.  This book was a big let down compared to how great SUMMER OF MY GERMAN SOLDIER was!  Plus it did not answer many of the unanswerd questions that the pre-qual left behind!!  I was not pleased with this book.  It was complicated,and rushed.	2005-10-10

I can identify with all you rabid Stephen King fans out there, as I am one myself. Most of you would agree that the master of horror couldn't write something uninteresting if he tried. This book has few bright spots however, and none of the \\"I can't put this book down\\" feel that is common to most of Mr. King's work. It is short enough that readers should make it through to the end, but what is waiting there to reward them is no prize. Mr. King's popularity sets him into a unique place. He can publish anything, and book sellers and loyal fans will eat it up. Because of this, I think he is toying with his readers, as an experiment. What he hopes to learn by this experiment is beyond me, and I am not happy to have been a part of it. Read this book if you feel you must, or if you have read everything he has ever written, but be warned, it is not up to his usual standard.	2005-10-10

Charlie Fox's boyfriend is on assignment in Florida and he wangles her a job working security for the software company that's hired him. Her assignment, guarding the teenaged son of a star programmer, is annoying because the kid is a bit of a jerk, but she's out of cold England, enjoying the Florida sunshine, and able to spend the nights with her boyfriend--or at least that's the plan. But the plan goes very badly astray when someone tries to grab the kid at an amusement park--and opens fire.<br /><br />Unsure of who she can trust, fingered by someone as responsible for the killings herself, and alone in a foreign country, Charlie and Trey go on the run. When she tries to make contact with her employer, instead of help, more gunmen come after her. When she tries to find her boyfriend, she learns that he has disappeared, along with Trey's father. Charlie is dedicated to her job, but there's only so much one woman can do--and it would sure be easier if the kid she's supposed to guard wasn't such an annoying punk.<br /><br />Gradually, Charlie unravells some of the truth--that the software program is important, and could motivate murder, that there are multiple factions seeking the secret of the program, and that she's been set up as the scapegoat in whatever happens. Staying alive long enough to take advantage of what she's learned is going to be a challenge, though.<br /><br />Author Zoe Sharp plunges Charlie Fox from one danger to the next, barely giving the reader a chance to breathe. Readers may not be too surprised by some of the twists and turns that the plot takes, and there are a few cases where we wonder how a woman as sharp as Charlie didn't see things coming, but overall FIRST DROP is an enjoyable story.	2005-10-10

This study of her life and \\"Little Way\\" reveals the journey of a pampered, excessivly emotional and devout middle-class French girl who was formed into one of the only three women who have been declared Doctors of the Church.  Ida Gorres strips off the sentimentality that has threatened to turn Therese into a sugary caracature of herself.  She carefully deals with all the negative aspects of Therese's culture, upbringing, life as a nun, and unglamorous, excruciating and humiliating death of TB at age 24.  When Gorres has exposed all the aspects of the sentimental religiosity of that time and place, sparing nothing in revealing Therese and her family to us with all their \\"warts\\", she then proceeds to delineate how Therese rose above all that, and even contradicted it in her \\"new\\" spiritual understanding. It becomes clear that it was a direct action of the Holy Spirit, needed by the modern religious seeker.  <br /> <br />Jansenism still tainted the devout Catholicism of that time.  Somehow, Therese saw through the heresy and formulated a spirituality that returned the Church to the basics of Christianity.  What is most surprising to me is that she did it alone, with no person to teach or counsel her.  Indeed, very few of the people around her even understood her, including her loving blood sisters who were also in the same convent.  Ida Gorres tells this story clearly and with considerable insight into true sanctity. <br /> <br />This is not a book to approach lightly, although it is not hard to read.  It stretches the reader's understanding, calling one to greater love of God and the truth about following Jesus.  One dares to try Therese's Way even in very different circumstances of life. Gorres does away with the plaster saint figure of church statues and gives us an intelligent, flesh-and-blood, mature, serious, and appealing saint to be our teacher.  I recommend this book highly for anyone who is seeking true teaching and inspiration in their Christian walk.	2005-10-10

US	33622372	R2MTVHCWD0TFPR	0688133827	901097586	Pegasus	Books	5	23	23	N	N	Very nice book	I am happy with this purchase.  The story is well-written with  Craft's beautiful artwork.  The story is about a king's son, Bellerophon, who was set up by a jealous foe to be killed.  But the kindy king Bellerophon was sent to could not kill a good man by his own hand, so the kindly king sent Bellerophon on a challenge to kill the bloodthirsy Chimera monster... to certain death.  But Bellerophon sought help from a wise man who told him to find Pegasus, that attacking Chimera from the air would put him at an advantage over other men that died trying.  But Pegasus is hard to find and also wild.  This is the story of how Bellerophon found Pegasus, how they became 'brothers in trust', and how together they were able to finally destroy Chimera.  But will the kindly king that was told to kill Bellerophon be able to follow through once Bellerophon proves himself such a hero on top of being the good-hearted man that impressed him?  And what about the kindly king's daughter who Bellerophon quickly fell in love with?      This picture book fits nicely into a collection of other story books of this genre, such as Beauty and the Beast and The Twelve Dancing Princesses, both written by Mayer (Beauty was illustrated by another great artist named Mercer Mayer, Craft illustrated Pegasus and 12 Dancing Princesses).  The nice thing about this book is that the focus is not on romance, so it is quite a different story and one that my son may get more into when older (although I myself have a weakness towards the romances!).  There is the slaying of Chimera, so it is more violent than the above mentioned fairy tales, but as I said, the 'dragon slaying' quality may appeal to boys.      Stories like this and most books in this genre don't spell out every action or emotion, but that's the nature of fairy tales.  I think it's nice to use our imaginations to fill in the gaps and details; these stories are thought provoking.      My only complaint about Craft's artwork is that the charactersin her various books look so similar.  For example, the princess in Pegasus looks just like the main princess in 12 Dancing Princesses.  And with her Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty books, I can't tell a difference between the two different woman.  A lot of the princes look the same, and, in my opinion, they all have the face and headsize of a ten year old boy painted atop a man's body.  Her artwork is beautiful, and I know that's the style, but it does kind of disappoint me, along with how the people look alike from story to story.  But nonetheless, the art is great and beautifully detailed, and the stories are classic.      Children have always and will always be intrigued by fairy tales (and mythology), so that's what makes these beautiful books so great to own.  They will be read and reread, with the artwork studied.  My daughter is only 3 1/2 and already adores anything fairytale she is allowed to see:  books, begs to watch my Faerie Tale Theatre collection (great shows from the 80s!), the Barbie fairytale stuff, you name it.  That's why I consider books like these a good investment, and with care, they can be passed down.	2005-10-10
US	52880883	R2HOU8ESBHSMXU	0028644107	330704435	The Complete Idiot's Guide to Middle East Conflict (2nd Edition)	Books	1	34	67	N	N	Heavily biased	To me, a successful overview of the Middle East should be (1) factual, and (2) unbiased.  I read many of the reviews that stated this book was biased, but there were enough positive reviews that I figured the charges of bias were just the inevitable result of glossing over some details for brevity's sake. <br /> <br />I was wrong.  This book is so heavily biased that it reads more like propaganda than a fair account of history.  After a few chapters, I found myself questioning the validity of the facts themselves -- at that point, the book was pretty much useless to me.  <br /> <br />To illustrate my point (and because I didn't heed the \\"bias\\" calls from earlier reviewers), I decided to include two quick samples of the bias in the book: <br />-- This statement on p. 69, which is indicative of the tone of the book:  \\"The Arabs weren't happy with Jewish immigration because they believed it would lead to their displacement from Palestine.  This assumption simply was not the case, and subsequent history would prove it.\\" <br />-- A recurring sidebar called \\"Tut Tut!\\" is supposed to correct common \\"mistakes & misstatements\\" about the Middle East.  There are 38 of these sidebars in the book -- 28 are pro-Israeli, 13 are neutral or indeterminate, none are pro-Arab.   <br /> <br />Now, I'm not pro-Arab (or pro-Israeli, for that matter).  But seriously - the most contentious subject in the history of mankind, and the author can't even find one example (out of 38 sidebars) of an incorrect statement that bolsters the Arab cause?  How is this kind of bias helping us to understand (and maybe eventually solve) the problems in this region?  I think a book this biased simply makes matters worse by perpetuating the arguments of one side. <br /> <br />Bottom line -- if you're looking for a fair discussion of the Middle East, there have GOT to be better books out there -- I'd suggest moving on to another book.  And if you find a good one, please post a review - I'm still looking. <br />	2005-10-10

By the time of 1993's Meatmen Volume 14, the publisher and several of his better contributors had already parted company, and the cracks were beginning to show; the front and back covers by 'Osze' on this volume were a particular error in judgement, as while you can get away with a certain percentage of duff art inside, slapping mediocrely-traced fanboy sketches on the front of the book will only deter possible readers and browsers. <br />Inside, there's many of the usual faces; a vintage Tom of Finland, \\"Forced Entry\\" by 'Stephen', admittedly the strongest and most erotic story in the book, where opportunistic burglars take more than their victim's valuables; 'Sean's \\"Tunnel of Lust\\", with his usual cast of Jethro-clones. All good, fun stuff, and joined this time by Neal Adams-wannabe 'Hozer', and Joven's \\"Jack Masters, Private Dick\\", two creditable and nicely-drawn genre pieces.  <br />However, there's also lengthy contributions from the dated and distorted 'Mike', John Blackburn's 'Coley' who's convoluted and overly-ornate style doesn't work for me, the aforementioned 'Osze', and Farraday, one of the less competent renderers ever to hit Meatmen's pages. \\"Jackin' Off\\", by 'Joe', while faithfully traced from physique and porno mags, lacks credibility and fails to satisfy. So, that's half of the 'serious' contribs in some way deficient. <br />On the comedy front, things are more hopeful; Donelan and Kurt Erichsen work their usual bitchy magic, (what, no Jeff Krell's \\"Jayson\\" this time round? For shame!) and surprisingly, 'The Hun' proves more adept at one-off funnies this time than he ever does in his claustrophobic and sticky-fingered porno stories. <br />Not without merit, by any means, but if you're not a hopeless completist, and just want to sample a Meatmen volume, there are several rather better ones to try.	2005-10-10

The plot was well thought out and well executed.  So many romance plots borderline on the ridiculous, and this one I actually found credible.  Probably because the protagonists behaved like real people.<br /><br />But as much as I found myself admiring the plot and the characters, I realized that I didn't exactly LOVE the book.  It seemed rather slow-paced for my taste.  I felt as though I kept waiting for the book to \\"really get started,\\" and then was dismayed to see that I was nearly halfway through.  The last half is certainly better than the first, however, I think it took entirely too long to really get into this book.  Also, I thought the description on the back of the book was really misleading.  I was under the impression that the \\"Robin Hood\\" aspect would be a significant part of the story, but this was not so.  I won't go into plot details and ruin the story for everyone, but I will say that I was disappointed that the Robin Hood aspect of the story was so absent.  For most of the book I thought perhaps the publishers had made a mistake and forgotten to update the book description.  The \\"real\\" plot was interesting enough, but I for one was looking forward to seeing how the author would handle a female Robin Hood figure in a romance.  I was disappointed.<br /><br />I would probably give this book three and a half stars.  I wouldn't recommend anyone against it, but I also wouldn't enthusiastically urge anyone to rush out and buy it.  Overall, just a pretty average read with its bad points neutralized by good writing and strong characters.	2005-10-10

Ignore those who didn't like this book!!! <br /> <br />Anne McCaffrey, passed but not forgotten, handed her Pern torch to her son, Todd.  Their collaboration on \\"Dragon's Kin\\" was Todd's introduction.  \\"Dragonsblood\\" was done without his mother.  His willingness to continue the legacy of Pern for us is very commendable and appreciated.  The distenters are just rabble-rousing and are without empathy.  Todd's handling of this new Pern novel was very good - better than I could have ever done!  Who is to say mother didn't leave book ideas for his next ten books?  The book itself was very good and any good reader should be able to follow it easily, I had no problem.  The one who wrote that it was hard to believe - let me remind you that this is a FANTASY WORLD (duh) and there is license to expand or contract based on nothing but whim!  Todd did very well keeping things together and presented a very enlightening plot that I had never thought could be included in the Pern series.  The fact that nothing in prior Pern novels hinted at this plot - well do you know everything that happened to people in America or Africa or China all along the time line?  No!  Neither do we about Pern!  Give the guy a chance and address your critiques to the Editor! <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fantasy mixed with science, who is willing to support a new writer and support the legacy of a great friend, Anne McCaffrey.	2005-10-10

Unlike many children's cookbooks, this one actually involves useful cooking techniques. The recipes are simple and the story engaging. This is a gem for me to use when I have little ones around who want to \\"help\\" as we can find something for them to make that the rest of us really want to eat.	2005-10-10

US	39473064	R2X596DOTQ6XS	0385486804	674569455	Into the Wild	Books	2	6	12	N	N	Not enough material for a book	While the story of McCandless is semi-interesting, there doesn't appear to be enough material for a book.  The author attempts to flesh out the story through long quotations, his personal stories, stories of others, and information about McCandless from people who could not have known him well.  Curiously, Krakauer refers often to the photos McCandless took of his surroundings and himself, but only offered one in the book.   <br /> <br />For my two cents, I think Chris McCandless has some mental problems.  He was charismatic and charming with strangers, but had no friends or family that he kept in contact with that he had known for more than two years.  He knew that he would quite possibly die in Alaska, and he did. Was he an explorer, a free spirit, a silly young man, an incompetent egotist?  In the end I didn't really care that much.  It's a sad story and I hope at least that it will serve as a warning for the foolhardy.  Otherwise it would have been better to leave the story alone, let the family get over their grief, and not subject readers to such round-about writing.	2005-10-10

Books	5	1	2	N	Y	The Falls	I enjoyed the rich history and for the most part, factual tidbits about the pollution issues of that time. The Falls, is a troubled community in this story, and I got involved in the page turning aspects quickley. The struggles of a family and the families around them, are astounding. The author truley has a gift for covering all aspects and keeping the reader begging for more. Alot of years are spanned in this story, and the author kept it all tied together extremely well. It's a keeper. (Not a book to give away.)	2005-10-10

This book covers most of the key concepts and ideas that are essential for a proper understanding of this extremely important area of pure and applied mathematics.<br /><br />I will however give this book only 3 stars, and this is because, inspite of everything it has, this book simply fails to create any motivation for the subject. There are little real world applications. For eg, a lot is written on Vector Spaces, and operators, but hardly anything on how these ideas are made to work in the real world. One might argue that applications really form a part of Matrix Analysis, but well, I think a Math major doing a course on Linear Algebra, needs to develop some fundamental (and algorithmic) concepts in Matrix Analysis too. After understanding what eigen-values and eigen-vectors are, I am sure students need to know \\"how\\" these are calculated in real-world applications. And this where, the harder algorithms, and some more abstract concepts creep in. Sadly, Linear Algebra by Hoffman, has nothing on this.	2005-10-10

Religion, as we know it, it outdated. It's an unpopular belief, but religion is fairy tale. Mr. Harris explains his position and is most concerned that others should be able to verbalize their beliefs, even if they are not politically correct. This book hit a nerve with me and gave some of my beliefs credibitity. This is a must read for anyone interested in exploring their own belief systems.	2005-10-10

The novel's structure is a bit clumsy.  The language is not the hyper-clean, fanciful, elegant prose people seem to love in contemporary Indian English-language writers.  There are no drunken avatars, scheming matriarchs, spunky research scientists, or sexy-but-ill-fated intercaste romances.  But what you do get is a real slice of Delhi life in all its kookiness, violence, desperation and denial.  It's funny and devastating, and it's political without being preachy or heavy-handed.  Last, a reviewer below complains that Bajwa's characterization of \\"upper-class belles\\" is over the top.  Having known many such belles myself, I find her descriptions and dialogue to be spot on.	2005-10-10
