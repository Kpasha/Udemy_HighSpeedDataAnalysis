I thoroghly enjoyed this book from cover to cover. <br /> <br />True, it does rehash events we've already seen in the show and I can see why some readers were disappointed, but I enjoyed hearing those events told from Spike's point of view.  It made his madness in Lessons understandable and even, at some points, sorta rational. <br /> <br />His love for Buffy really shines through in this book, and while I'm more of a Buffy/Angel fan, I found it heartening and touching.   <br /> <br />This book is well written and wonderfully descriptive.  Spike is an awesome character with a lot of depth and history, and he deserved his own book.  The author brings him to life in this story. <br /> <br />If you're a Spike fan, curl up with it.  It brings the reader as close to the blond vampire as a fan can hope to get.  A great read!	2005-10-13

This book comes out of the romance novel tradition, and while there's nothing wrong with that, it's not my thing.  The book wasn't at all what I was expecting: the vampires in this novel eat food, like garlic, go to church, and can go out in the sun as long as they wear long sleeves.  In other words, the vampires have been cleaned up for the conventions of the romance novel.<br /><br />If that's your cup of tea, go for it, but this novel may disappoint those of us whose ideas about vampires come from the horror tradition and not the romance tradition.<br /><br />For sexy and romantic vampires that DO come more from the horror tradition, try Laurell K. Hamilton.	2005-10-13

The editors assembled a wide range of computer security talent to show the way identity theft can be abused for crime.  This work of fiction is closer to truth than you'd wish possible.  These sobering tales of computer exploits explains the motto \\"Control Information, Control Life.\\" <br /> <br />It's a scary thought that this much information (and therefore power) is so easily available online. <br />The book makes an interesting point about how some people will be secure in protecting their personal information, but then post genealogy information online freely without realizing its value to crackers. <br /> <br />Learning to \\"know your enemy\\" in the computer realm requires a pirate's intuition, savvy?  Chapter 2 is a neat scenario for creating and cracking codes.  My wonder is where did all the money comes from and what was his father up to?  Chapter 3 sounds frightfully easy to do - knowledge is power.   <br /> <br />The stories are compelling and interesting, arousing both fear and intrigue.  This shows how close fiction and real life can be.  Parts of the book and the ending are somewhat hard to follow and I found the ending disappointing.  Although you get the endgame of the story, it'd like to learn more about the lessons learned from such an experience.  In thinking through all these activities, what can be learned for prevention of identity theft for our individual, business, and government responsibilities? <br />The book doesn't fully address the added possibilities of fraud, cyber stalking, information abuse, blackmail, and spamming that these cyber capabilities allow.	2005-10-13

With language that is succinct and precise, he takes us on the ultimate surreal journey; the journey of the questions of late middle age.  Gratuitously, Coetzee gives us a clue to the dream journey by calling one main character \\"Marijana,\\" a word/name whose resemblance to the hallucinogen of virtually the same spelling but for one letter is inescapable.  This device allows Coetzee to do a unique and wonderful thing.  It allows him to have an entire book that represents one man's conversation with himself, complete with graphic images. <br /> <br />His protagonist \\"Paul\\" is a retired photographer, who is living a nice and full life at the age of 60.  Due to a fantastic accident on his bicycle, he has recovered.  But he has not recovered completely.  His knee was totally shattered and his leg was amputated just above the knee.  It is as a result of this condition, that he hires a nurse. <br /> <br />Yet, we must remember that the conversations are all with Paul himself.  Whatever the characters say or do are all written by Paul.  He writes the lines.  He creates the images.  All in the book is constructed or written by Paul.  And those constructions are specifically targeted to answer a very difficult trifurcated question.  \\"What to do with the rest of my life?\\" <br /> <br />The question has 3 potential answers.  The first is to go back to his prior life as best he can, given his condition.  The second is to sit in his gloomy room till he dies a natural death, nothing ventured, nothing lost; so to speak.  The third is to choose to self-terminate and save himself the pain and anxiety.  These are the choices Paul has to select from.  There are no others.  And through this phantasmagoria, Paul investigates the inevitable question that faces all of us when we are `struck down' for the first time at some point in life. <br /> <br />The book is written with extreme aplomb and illustrates some of the deepestquestions of life.  Have I been a contributor?  Have I lived a full life?  Have I lived a righteous life?  Have I accomplished anything by which to be remembered?  All of us at some point have the opportunity to ask these questions.  Almost all of us will at some point, have this conversation with ourselves. <br />	2005-10-13

Basically, the story says that there is a cabal of men (and women too, I suppose, though Twelve Hawks doesn't mention any) who really rule the world, and they are opposed by people who are born with the potential to travel between universes - travelers, they're called - who by their very nature have the ability to effect changes in world affairs. <br /> <br />Devotees of \\"The X-Files\\" will devour this book and its potential sequels lock, stock, and barrel.  And just like that TV series, I'm sure they will find more questions than answers.

The leaders of the Catholic Church would, of course, want to have people believe that she was lying, but they are the true liars. They lie about the reason for every one of their satanic rituals. Anyone interested in the satanic background of the Catholic Church should read The Two Babylons by Alexander Hislop. Maria Monk cared deeply about the Catholic people who were going to die and go to hell because they never trusted what God said in the Bible. They believe in penances, purgatory, indulgences, worship of graven images, etc. etc. which are spoken against by God in the Bible. We are saved by being born again through a saving faith in Jesus Christ. He died once for all, and priests are all liars because they would have people believe they can somehow sacrifice Him over and over again on their demon alters. Maria Monk's testimony reveals a true witness for the saving grace of Jesus Christ. That this book, or any other book, has tried to slander her by saying it is fiction, reveals how far the devil can go to try to keep his deception alive and well that the Catholic Church is \\"Christian.\\" Any born again Christian recognizes that the Catholic Church is full of pagan rituals that are evil and satanic. Read the Bible and the truth will set you free. May God bless Maria Monk for her braveness in telling her story in the face of evil.	2005-10-13

And the behind-the-scenes account of the part of Gatorade that we all know about, the commercials, was equally interesting and entertaining.  I found myself singing 'Be Like Mike' and reminscing about the great Jordan commercials.   I definitely would have paid a premium for an accompanying dvd of all the great Gatorade commercials.

Almost alone at a retreat in North Carolina, one week has stretched into three, but the real world is calling again and they must reluctantly part ways.<br /><br />Just as they reach the airport, Callie gets a phone call from Stella Gold.  Her husband Eli has just been shot by a sniper and is in surgery.  Before loosing consciousness, he specifically asked for the two of them to come.  Since Eli is such a good friend, they drop everything and rush to his bed side.<br /><br />A PI, Callie wants to figure out what happened to Eli.  The only clue is a warning from someone named Nadine.  When Eli and Stella's condo is searched, it is further proof that someone is after him.  Where might he have hidden his notes?  And why did Eli request Tom's presence?<br /><br />As this series has progressed, the plots have only gotten strong, and this book is no exception.  It starts with a bang and keeps right on going.  Every time an answer comes, it only leaves more questions.  Yet Callie and Tom keep digging, getting themselves further and further in trouble.  While some things seemed obvious a little early on, there are still several nice twists along the way that keep the reader guessing.<br /><br />Fans of the series will be happy to learn that Tom is a very active part of this book instead of only a presence like in previous entries.  In fact, we even get to learn what he does, finally.  His relationship with Callie continues to grow as she continues to move on from her husband's death.  In fact, one of the strong points of the series is watching Callie finally truly deal with her grief.<br /><br />The writing style is still a little rough, keeping the reader a little more at bay by telling instead of showing.  It's not a big problem, however, and I found myself staying up too late reading every night to see what would happen in the next chapter.<br /><br />The only problem with this book is the cliffhanger ending.  Even though I saw it coming (I've read the back of the next book already), it still left me wanting to pick up the next book right away.

Quality professional women are harder to get and no \\"tricks\\" really work.  Meeting a girl in a bar is easier than you may think because of the mere fact that the woman is at the bar to socialize and meet people.  However, remember conventional wisdom about meeting people in bars is probably true.  Look at the characters in this book and their dysfunctions: that will be the type of people you attract.  To read about someone throwing tantrums IS entertaining to live with someone like that IS NOT.<br /><br />2.  The best technique to getting women is to be successful (defined by yourself), have decent grooming about your looks, and be friendly.  If you are missing one of these factors \\"the game\\" won't work.<br /><br />3.  Psychologically, people are attracted to mates who are in their own league, for example a fit attractive \\"8\\" girl will be attracted to a 7-10 guy, or vice versa, not a guy who is a 5 and is out of shape.  Notice how most couples have mates that are similar to them in attractiveness regardless of skin color, profession, etc.; sure exceptions exist but pay attention to the majority.  People are attracted to people who are similar to themselves or who will better them not opposites (although it probably is many average mens' fantasy to find a beautiful girl who will...once again marketing/media has a very strong effect on how you perceive the world and others).  Attraction is not a choice people make solely on a few criteria unless it is short term, that is why some people give everything of themselves and nothing works.<br /><br />4.  Money is to be made by marketing things like AXE Body spray, $50,000 convertibles, \\"THE GAME-guide bible/book\\", etc. to make people think that \\"If I only had...\\" scenarios (which is fun to do) but at the end of the day men/women prefer a mate who complements them both in looks and lifestyle.<br /><br />5.  PROS: The book is entertaining and cleverly marketed but be realistic about yourself.  The book does make you think that you can go out and girls will fall all over you which in some ways is positive because it MAY give you confidence and may help you meet girls initially, but negative if you think you will get a Paris Hilton type girl to come home with you.<br /><br />6. LASTLY: If this book does give you the confidence to make you like Hugh Hefner (truly  the greatest pick-up artist, AMAZING life story) great for you but take most of this book with a grain of salt as the cleverly marketed book it is.t and girls will fall all over you which in some ways is positive because it MAY give you confidence and may help you meet girls initially, but negative if you think you will get a Paris Hilton type girl to come home with you.  <br />6.

Some books, after all, are great for read-once inspiration. Other books simply demand that you get your own copy, because it's earned a spot on your shelf.<br /><br />I've been working with The Thimbleberries Guide for Weekend Quilters for the last couple of weeks, courtesy of the Scottsdale Library, and I'm just finishing up one of the quilt projects. I'm probably going to order my own copy of the book; but the key word is \\"probably\\" (as opposed to \\"definitely, I'm doing it now!\\"). It has some compelling features... though it's not perfect, either.<br /><br />Let's start with the good stuff. The 25 projects in this book are  mostly full size (double and queen-sized) quilts, though there are several smaller quilts (such as the one I chose, a table runner). Most have an accompanying project, such as pillowcases to go with the quilt, or a fabric-trimmed rug.<br /><br />Not all of them are gorgeous, but none of them are lame. The designs are primarily using traditional blocks, such as flying geese, though a few projects also incorporate applique. While the quilts aren't labeled for expected skill, they all seemed pretty straightforward to this still-a-beginner.<br /><br />One thing I *love* about the book -- and which earned it a star all on its own -- is that each project is shown with a color photo and matching quilt diagram, _plus_ another picture showing the same quilt done in different colors. That works wonders, when you're trying to visualize how this quilt will look with the fabrics you already have in your stash.<br /><br />Each project is laid out in sections, to accomodate the premise of the busy weekend quilter who can grab time in small chunks. That's a strengh of the book, but it also contributes to its weakness. (At least for me; it may work exactly the way you prefer.)<br /><br />Every project gives a complete list of fabric you'll need (1/2 yard gold print, 5/8 yard red print, etc.); that's standard. However, most quilt books have you cut all the fabric in one fell swoop, so you can get done with that task and put away the rotary cutter. Instead, this book treats each part of the project (cutting the blocks, making the border, etc.) as a separate project. You cut out the fabric for the blocks, then piece them. THEN you cut out the fabric for the quilt center, and piece that.  Then you cut for the border, etc.<br /><br />If you're really working on the weekend-quilter schedule -- just a little bit at a time -- maybe this works for you. In my case, I found it irritating. I had to leave my entire setup spread up (on the dining room table, as it happens) over the course of most of a week, as I wanted to get this silly little table runner done (in addition to working 60 hours a week). I'd rather have done ALL the cutting, then tackled the piecing. Which, of course, I could certainly have done, if I had realized the non-standard way the book presents the project. Instead, I kept being surprised that I had to cut stuff AGAIN! If you know this ahead of time, it may be less annoying; you'll expect it.<br /><br />Overall, however, this is a very good book. The author is cognizant that you have limited time, and has designed a book full of attractive, do-able quilts that you can be proud of.yard gold print, 5/8 yard red print, etc.); that's standard.

The twist of a far away time in the future, when Ancient civilization (us) has destroyed themselves by warfares and ultimate mortal engines, really made the story hard to put down. The stage was created complete with the new religions, new ways of life and new societies. All was well but I can not help if I feel something missing by the end. Perhaps it was the easiness of the author in killing many of the key characters, but I think it was necessary to picture the power of destruction of the resurrected engines or it just the quiet ending after the great climax. In short, I like the unexpected elements and am looking forward for the next book.	2005-10-13

I don't recall the author promising that reading his book will change one's  life, or that reading Proust's work will necessarily be a life-changing experience--only that it might turn out that way. <br /> <br />I was given a dog-eared copy of How Proust Can Change Your Life by a friend whom I'd told I was considering giving Proust a go. I read maybe half of it, found it amusing, and found the portrayal of Proust amusing as well. The book seemed to fizzle out after that, but what I'd read was enough to get me started on Swann's Way. I had not expected Proust to be comical in any way, but I credit Alain de Botton for illuminating Proust's self-deprecating sense of humor. Had it not been for that, I might never have made it past the famous and seemingly interminable description of juvenile insomnia that opens Swann's Way, much less enjoyed it. <br /> <br />Five years later, I have just finished The Captive and plan to begin The Fugitive within the next month or so. Has Proust changed my life? Well, yes. His work has attuned me to the importance of paying attention, resisting the dulling effects of habit, slowing down, finding meaning in the ordinary rhythms of life, accepting the painful inevitabilities of existence, laughing at my own foibles. There's more, but I won't bore you with it. <br /> <br />Proust is not everyone's cup of tea. But he might be yours. And if he is, you're in for what can, in fact, be a life-changing experience. (At the rate I'm reading him, it could also be a lifelong experience.) You may not be happier, handsomer, thinner, richer, or smarter, but you just might have a better understanding of why being who, what, and where you are is worthy of your attention.  <br /> <br />If you're thinking about diving into Proust and not sure that it will be worth the effort, I'd recommend spending a few bucks on this primer first. If it inspires you to move on to the real thing, that's great. If it doesn't, you will have saved yourself hundreds of hours of what could be, for some, utter tedium. And if happiness, beauty, and wealth are what you really want, and you want them now, there's always Dr. Phil.	2005-10-13

I have been a yo-yo dieter, compulsive overeater since the age of 4. Up and down the scale all the live long day, and mostly overweight. In fact..yes...I think my \\"thin\\" lasted about 13 minutes one time.  <br /> <br />I have read many books on the same subject content...but none hit me like this one. I GOT IT!! Knowing that Rob Stevens totally understands, has been there and has overcome is incredibly inspiring.  <br /> <br />I no longer obsess about food 24 hours a day (a miracle). I now stop as soon as I am satisfied and not overeat (miracle). It is ingrained that I will never diet again (another miracle).  <br /> <br />This book helped me to LISTEN to my body and honor it in a loving way. Instead of outside influences (otherwise known as \\"they-say\\")...telling me \\"don't eat this, and eat that\\". How many fad diet books CAN we buy anyway?? (I for one, could open a book store).  <br /> <br />Rob's \\"non-diet\\" book is a fun and fast, highly impactful read. You get the message and it stays with you.

The Mom Inventor's Handbook is a very detailed, hands on guide for taking an invention from idea to reality. There are several things I believe make it so useful: it's relevant and recent (no outdated advice here), it's based on real-world experience from an inventor and the others she has mentored, and it offers myriad resources to implement her advice. The examples of moms who have had success also make it inspirational.<br /><br />I also liked how the author uses examples that clearly illustrate what she is advising. For examples, she gives before and after pictures of the packaging design for her invention, the TP Saver when illustrating design elements.<br /><br />I interviewed the author about the book on my Internet radio show, EverydayWealthRadio, and found her to be very knowledgeable. If you've been thinking of inventing a product, this is a book you must have.	2005-10-13

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The protagonist, Alessandra, is not sympathetic and it's very difficult to bring oneself to care about her struggles. The novel does have a few redeeming qualities - Dunant's skill with words and her knowledge of Florence. Her descriptions of life in Renaissance Florence are fascinating and carried me through the novel even when I had lost patience with the narrative. In fact, all of the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting. Dunant is definitely a skilled writer but this book is not her best.	2005-10-13

As the true life recounting of finding a lost and forgotten German WWII submarine off the U.S. coast I found it engaging in several respects.  The story moves along at a fairly good clip with lots of details about the deep dives and WWII submarine operations - technical yet never boring.  The author puts enough background into the major real life characters that you have a real grasp of who these people are and why they do what they do. I found it to be accurate in every way with decisive drama over the deaths that occurred while trying to retrieve items from the sub.  The reader is gripped with the very real danger that surrounds these kinds of deep dives.  The terrible physical affects of the 'bends'were quite descriptive and a bit unnerving.  And, as a WWII history buff I also found this book very satisfying on that level as well. I even found myself trying to \\"guess\\" which U-boat it was after the author put forth the alternatives.  I was taken so much by the lost U-boat crew that I did some research on the internet to \\"see\\" the real life crew (there is a website with actual photos).  Who were these men that were entombed in this watery grave for 45 years?  I also found the research that was done; talking with WWII survivors, pouring over Coast Guard and U.S. Navy log books, etc. to be quite interesting. The book has a very satisfying ending and is definitely worth reading.  You will not be disappointed.	2005-10-13

First, it is full of factual errors (many noted by other reviewers here).  Those errors should have been caught before the book was published.  Second, Ms. Pont leaned much too heavily on the metaphors she introduced in her chapter titles (e.g., \\"Irony,\\" \\"Knowing,\\" \\"Full Circle,\\" \\"Luck\\"), and so hammered the reader with them, under the flimsiest of pretexts, that it at times felt like reading a freshman term paper.  That problem might have been resolved with another draft or two.  Finally, the book would have felt more structured if the author had focused more tightly on the amazing streak of Miami of Ohio coaches (Gillman, Hayes, Parseghian, Pont, Schembechler, Mallory) and not pursued tangents with other members of the \\"brotherhood of Ohio coaches.\\"    But I still fully enjoyed the book, because Ms. Pont's affection for her subjects is contagious.  And because she seemed to pull warmth out of those subjects that other writers do not necessarily find.    So I recommend the book to anyone who loves college football.

I was not sorry I did, from the first page to the last.  I am a very strong believer that everyone should learn their countries history, from the beginning to the present.  Mr. McCullough certainly gives us an enjoyable way of learning a small, but important part of ours!  The year 1776 was the lowest point of our war for independence for the men and women who struggled against seemingly insurmountable odds.  We of course know that in the end, they did win out against these improbably odds.  This should give all of us encouragement and hope.I also must admit that my admiration for General Washington rose quite a lot.  He, Washington, has taken some hard hits lately over the fact that he was a slave owner.  It must be remembered that he was a product of his times and was acting accordingly.  I am quite sure that in two or three hundred years, we, as a society will take our share of criticism after being viewed through the scope of our coming history.  The author's  narrative was wonderful and he certainly performed some meticulous research.  I do feel that for the reader to get the most of this work, it would certainly be an advantage to know a bit of American History in reference to before and after this particular time period.  But then again, it is not absolutely necessary to thoroughly enjoy this work.  There is nothing of the text book flavor about this book and it holds the readers interest from front to back.  I highly recommend this one and in fact, recommend it as an addition to your library as you will no doubt want to give it a reread on down the road.	2005-10-13

But when the gov't gives you that much attention and tries to go after you and sue you, ban you, etc...you know this guy has something worth your attention. People say he's a scam. Well what's worse.....buying his 30 dollar book (which you can get for 16 or 17 at Sam's Club)and maybe paying a little more to be a member on his site or paying thousands a year every year to doctor's that give you a pill that just alleviate the symptoms and don't do crap for the cause of the problem? Not to mention most of the stuff in grocery stores that are in boxes, bags, bottles, and cans have countless tons of garbage ON TOP of the garbage already listed on the labels that turn your body into a human waste basket. No one can deny that Americans are probably among the most unhealthy people on earth because of bars, McDonald's, pop machines, and processed foods. Kevin is shedding the light on the financial demons that run our gov't, drug and food corporations, etc. and is a guiding light to get us out of the dark. Half the problems we have now we didn't have hundreds of years ago when corporate America became the power it is today. People wake up. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that eating an organic apple or head of lettuce is safer than eating a Big Mac or taking NyQuill. LOL And if you think he's full of crap, then why don't you all do everything OPPOSITE of what he says and see how well the turn out is? I totally am behind Kevin and his crusade to bring truth back into the world. The ultimate goalof many people is happiness. Your health is a part of that happiness. Why not get a head start on it?	2005-10-13

I read this book because Oprah recommended it and she usually has Sixth Sense when it comes to good books!  <br /> <br />I wish I had ordered Martha Stewart's new book instead. <br /> <br />Although Frey is a good writer--even masterful in places--too much of the book was repetitious.  <br /> <br />One thing he does well is flesh out his characters so they become real, enabling his readers to sympathize with them. I felt the pain of his characters, but the joy of reading about the \\"overcomers\\" was the highlight of the book. And his dialogue seems realistic. <br /> <br />While I think this book might benefit some people with addictive personalities--in danger of becoming addicted to alcohol and/or drugs--I could only give it a 4-star.

His work, however, was theoretical. Since it was theoretical, it is open to interpretation, application, etc. Otherwise, his work would be fact! Any basic Human Development course or text would reveal a more accurate critique of Erikson's work. Dewart provides a critique based on her religious beliefs--which is fine, except that you will note that all of her writings are pointing out which theorists, philosophers, ideologies do not match her religious beliefs.You would think that someone writing a book about the errors of a major psychological theory would have a more appropriate background than Dewart's--she is a ventriloquist doing bible puppet shows! Don't waste your time with this one. Fabricant's book does a much better job of showing how Erikson's theory aligns with most religious doctrine, instead of running counter to it.	2005-10-13

Had I not read that book with it's emphasis on the organization, personalities and political history of the Nazis, Burleigh's work would have been even harder to follow then it was. It is implied that you have read it already or something like it, perhaps even Mein Kampf -- though the author rarely cites the latter and the former not at all --  and assumed you know the difference between a Gauleiter and Gruppenfhrer or are fully aware of the nature of the events and party infighting behind the Night of the Long Knives.  <br /> <br />You will find little information in this book about the roots of Nazism or the events that led to it's rise; nor will you get more than a glimpse of characterization of it's principal actors.  Having said that, A New History fills in some gaps left out of the popular William L. Shire work and others in the areas of economy, government, policy, and society with a very heavy emphasis on the crimes of Nazi Germany. <br /> <br />Burleigh does not try to hide -- and neither necessarily should he -- a personal bias that should be lacking in the objective observer in his view of seeing Nazi Germany as nothing but a state of pure evil with hatred it's only raison d'etre and who's only historic legacy was mass murder.  The narrative does a fine job of identifying the evolution and natural progression from eugenics to euthanasia to murders-of-convenience during wartime to large scale assembly-line genocide.  And yet, after we are told how it happened, we are still left to wonder -- and continue to wonder today, even as our own inner demons lead to events such as an abu gharib -- about the nature of the psyche that could lead sane people in a highly civilized culture to sink into barbarity.	2005-10-13

The other two reviewers on this page have noted that Balzac regarded this novel, certainly not his best, as one of his favourites, and I think that is due to the fact that throughout it he is playing with the characters and with the reader. One of the reviewers also noted the similarity with subjects treated by Stendhal and Falubert, and indeed it would be good if someone (I may do it one day) wrote an essay comparing this novel to Stendhal's \\"Red and Black\\" and Flaubert's \\"The Sentimental Education\\".  <br /> <br />This is what literary critics call a \\"bildungsroman\\", a novel of apprenticeship -or lack of it. Apparently a Romantic novel, it can also be read from the other side of the street, as an Anti-Romantic novel. The experienced reader of Balzac is surprised that here he turns out so much corniness and cheap sentimentality, until he/she finds out why at the end.  <br /> <br />Felix de Vandenesse is the youngest child of a noble family of Touraine, in beautiful Western Central France, whose luck has been bad under the Revolution and the Napoleonic Age. Nobody loves poor Felix, especially his horrible mother, who sends him to live first with a breast-feeder and then to cruel boarding schools where he suffers from loneliness and poverty. During his return home, he attends a party where he instantly falls in love with a married woman, older than him. In fact, he falls so in love that he kisses her shoulder, to the astonishment and rejection of the surprised lady. Felix then falls into depression and his mother sends him to the countryside with some rich friends. And... surprise surprise, the neighbor of the friends is none other than the lady and her husband and two permanently sick kids. Felix befriends the Mortsauf family and starts a strange, indeed sick, romance with his beloved, Henriette, Madame de Mortsauf. It's a platonic, repressed and tormented love affair. Thefour memebers of the Mortsauf family are among the strangest and most complex in all of literature, especially the Count and Henriette. The former is an asylum lunatic suffering from bipolar depressive disease, big time. He is hypochondriac, coleric, verbally violent, blackmailer and unsympathetic, and he makes life hell to his wife and kids. Henriette is also an emotional blackmailer, a religious fanatic, martyr by vocation, overprotecting mother and a lover with the Wendy complex: she feels herself to be the mother Felix never really had. The kids are two morbid creatures with a foot in the tomb, who appear and disappear like the children in Henry James's \\"Turn of the Screw\\". The novel is written in the form of a long letter Felix writes to his current lover many years after the events. <br /> <br />After some months by Henriette's side, young -and virgin- Felix leaves for Paris, where he will enjoy contacts in high places, provided by Henriette's parents. When he leaves, Felix carries a wonderful letter written by Henriette, in which she gives him sound advice about how to deal with the world of politics, sex, and business. It's one of the best parts of the novel. Through the years, Felix comes and goes keeping the platonic relationship with her. But then he gets an English lover and it all goes to the dogs. The scene of the confrontation with Henriette on the subject of the sexuallly greedy lover comes right out of a bad soap-opera: \\"I enjoy her body but it's you I really love\\" , \\"I'll never be yours but then no other can be\\".  <br /> <br />In the end cruel and funny, it is a little piece of psychological penetration, a dissertation on human nature, an examination of love, and the analysis of a twisted passion.	2005-10-13

But the latest addition to his ever-growing body of work is neither a police procedural nor a classic psychological thriller. Rather, it is a departure that introduces a whole new venue: a legal suspense tale titled THE LINCOLN LAWYER. Here he introduces readers to Michael \\"Mickey\\" Haller, a defense attorney who is always looking for the \\"franchise client\\" who will change his life. \\"A franchise client is a defendant who wants to go to trial and has the money to pay his lawyer's...rates. From first appearance to arraignment to preliminary hearing and on to trial and then appeal, [this kind of] client demands hundreds if not thousands of billable hours. From where [Mick sat] they are the rarest and most highly sought beast[s] in the jungle.\\"<br /><br />Mickey Haller is a cynic with a philosopher's approach to life. \\"After fifteen years of practicing law [he] had come to think of it in simple terms. The law was a large, rusting machine that sucked up people and lives and money.\\" Of himself he says, \\"I [am] just a mechanic. There is nothing about the law [he] cherished anymore. The law [is] not about truth. It [is] about negotiation, amelioration, manipulation.\\" He continues in this mode by stating, \\"I was needed and wanted. By both sides. I was the oil in the machine. I allowed the gears to crank and turn. I helped keep the engine of the system running.\\"<br /><br />As the novel opens Haller receives a call from Fernando Valenzuela, a bail bondsman he has worked with for years. Together they are waiting for that franchise client to drop into their laps. \\"I got something. I think I got a franchise player here.\\" The \\"something\\" is Louis Ross Roulet, arrested for what seems to be a bar pick-up turned deadly. \\"Guy's gotta be big money. Beverly Hills address, family lawyer waltzing in here first thing. This is the real thing, Mick. They booked him on a half mil and his mother's lawyer came in here today ready to sign over property...didn't even ask to get [the bail] lowered.\\"<br /><br />Haller agrees to interview the fellow in his holding cell at the jail, but he is too streetwise and savvy to even begin to think that this one is the case at the end of his financial rainbow. When he finally has the opportunity to meet this would-be client, Haller thinks, \\"Most of the time my clients have been in lockup before and they have the stone-cold look of the predator. It's how they get in jail. But Roulet was different. He looked like prey. He was scared and he didn't care who saw it and knew it.\\"<br /><br />One of the hardest stumbling blocks to a good defense is talk, jabber, chatter, sentences and paragraphs that all consist of words. Haller opines, \\"Most of my clients talk way too much. Usually they talk themselves right into prison.\\" After admonishing Roulet to keep his mouth shut, Haller leaves his new client in the holding tank and enters the courtroom. Valenzuela has already warned him that Maggie McPherson, aka Maggie \\"McFierce,\\" has been assigned to this case. She is \\"one of the toughest and...fiercest assistant district attorneys assigned to the Van Nuys courthouse. She also happened to be [his] first ex-wife\\" and the mother of his only child. She is not happy to see him. His presence here means she has to recuse herself from any participation in the Roulet matter, which could have been a career maker for her. But she gives the case up with good grace and still maintains her close friendship with her ex-husband.<br /><br />The overriding nightmare that haunts Mickey Haller is the possibility that he might not recognize an innocent man if he is ever called to defend him. As the case moves forward and he gets to know his client, he admits, \\"I felt uneasy about Roulet's story. It seemed so far-fetched that it might actually be true. And that bothered me. I was always worried that I might not recognize innocence. The possibility of it in my job was so rare that I operated with the fear that I wouldn't be ready for it when it came. That I would miss it.\\" Later in the narrative he berates himself for not being able to recognize evil when it stares him in the face.<br /><br />This conflict between good and evil is what drives the mystery writer. Without these two concepts they would have nothing to write about. And Michael Connelly is a master at grasping his characters' angst in regard to \\"good\\" vs. \\"evil,\\" which provides readers with just the right amount of suspense. Here he shows his talent as a master choreographer of the dance that lawyers perform regardless of which side of the courtroom they inhabit. His books are brilliantly constructed, the writing is strong and lucid, his plots have enough twists and turns to satisfy the most ardent reader, and his characters are always easy to recognize. He never writes down to his audience or takes them for granted.<br /><br />THE LINCOLN LAWYER is a courageous book in that it catapults Connelly out of the boundaries set by a series. Harry Bosch is a formidable and unforgettable character. He may be missed on this outing, but he is a staple in the top-notch procedurals that Connelly writes and will surely be back. In the meantime, this new novel will not disappoint those familiar with Michael Connelly or those new to his work.<br /><br />  --- Reviewed by Barbara Lipkien Gershenbaumnocence.

There's a photo of a race, but everybody seems to be looking behind them.  I couldn't figure it out until I started reading the chapter, that Mr. Davis decided to take up backwards running.

I recommend this book, not just for being well-written and enjoyable, but also for touching on how scary it is to grow up, take on adult responsibilities, and live up to the expectations of the family, partner, and self.  Mr. Davis' self-deprecating humor is charming, and I found myself rooting for him.

This is a Sam Vimes book and like all of his Sam vimes books, \\"Thud\\" is more dark than light.  Pratchett explores deeper meanings in these book than most of the rest of the series.  Sam Vimes is the heart and soul of the Discworld.  This time Pratchett explores the mideast conflict.  Two groups of ancient enemies are building up hostilities in the city of Ankh Moorpork over some ancient symbols.  The dwarves and troll do not need much antagonism to set them fighting each other.  A Dwarf radical is killed and the trolls are blamed, so the tension builds.  Enter Sam Vimes to solve the case, except nothing is as it appears on the surface. <br /> <br />Once again Pratchett has written a masterpiece.  His character sketches are getting better and better.  I have been reading this series for better than twenty years and I am still amazed how fresh this world feels.  Pratchett fill out Vimes more so now his home world is now starting to but into his working life.  \\"Some thing are important\\" is the catch phrase throughout and I won't tell you now because it will ruin the story.  Pratchett explores the concept of radical religion and how it affects even the non-religious.  He never blames either side, but explores how both sides are right and wrong.  The ending is superb as usual, but it is rather sad... to a point.   <br /> <br />The usual cast of characters are here and they are delightful as ever.  Highly recommended	2005-10-13

Told cleverly in flashback, The Long-Range Plan is a gripping story of the anti-hero who wants it all, deserves none of it, winds up with half of it, suspects it is the wrong half, but can never go back to find out.  <br />To say more in that vein would spoil the novel's delicious suspense, but be forewarned that the plot revolves around a love story and a caper that will keep you turning pages long past your bedtime.    <br />As the curtain rises, the anti-hero, Cole Archer, is a first-year high school teacher in Charleston, S.C., who will soon fall in love with one of his students, Savannah Bellington, a bright, fetching, ambitious girl, 16, from the wrong side of a wealthy school district, a trailer park. From the day they meet, the stage is set for tragedy, but our protagonist, now 26, has been rehearsing for it a long time. Since the high-water mark of his young life--graduating from college with honors--he has been in a downward spiral of wasted days and wasted nights fueled by prodigious drinking and promiscuous sex.  <br />The latest consequence of that lifestyle, being dumped by a fianc who wants a sober, faithful husband, not a boozing philanderer, has brought Archer to a new low--but to no new understanding of himself. Otherwise as smart as they come, he somehow missed out on the cause-and-effect connection between behavior and consequences, and goes right on making the same mistakes, mainly because he lacks a moral rudder. This is his fatal flaw. Fully aware, for instance, that a student-teacher affair in high school is The Big No-No, he does it anyhow. After all, self-indulgence is his speed, and the sooner, the better in all things. A frustrated writer, he hates the nine-to-five world and, though an excellent teacher, he despises the bureaucratic sinkhole that his school district has become. So when he sees a chance to take the money and run, well, what else could an anti-hero do? Indeed, quoted right up front in the novel is the maxim: \\"Never underestimate the power of cash.\\" <br />Archer does have redeeming qualities. He loves his cat, Brasco; he sympathizes with the weak; he's loyal to friends; he's grateful for favors; and he's squeamish about causing injury to others. Not squeamish enough not to do it, but squeamish nonetheless. But his chief redeeming quality is that we couldn't have this kind of story without this kind of character: a twenty-something man born to middle-class privilege in the Land of Opportunity who still can't win for losing--and has no idea why. The Long-Range Plan is a moral fable for modern times and is by a writer that readers are going to hear from a whole lot more.	2005-10-13

The book, though attributed to a single author, is actually a collection of short magazine articles written by several contributors, and gives a reasonably broad set of views on the windfalls and pratfalls of dealing in this market.   Though sympathetic to the marque and the pleasures of ownership, the collective authors lead one to the conclusion that Ferrari ownership is not for people unwilling to spend thousands of dollars on, say, a periodic valve adjustment.   Another view that is commmon among the collective authors is that ownership of depreciated (and hopefully future appreciating) Ferraris is not about everyday driving, but is about the pleasure of savoring the fact of ownership, and an occasional drive into town on a sunny weekend afternoon.   Anything more is such a risk to the value of the car that only persons having very large financial resources to devote to hobby cars would actually accumulate substantial miles on such a vehicle.    <br />Properly sobered by this information, somebody like me can decide to invest in one of these cars fully ready for the likely financial consequences of the decision.	2005-10-13

Pretty Evil by, first time author, Lexi Davis is a thrilling roller coaster ride that you do not want to end.  It is just that good!  The Pleasure Spot, once a decadent Beverly Hills brothel, has sat empty and unoccupied for 99 and three quarters of a year, as the original owner-sexy, sultry, nymphomaniac, she-demon named Vixx and her crusty, crumungedy side-kick, a one hundred twenty-something  ghoul named Crêp impatiently sat waiting out the rest of their term (just three more months and the 100th year term would be completed) in the cellar before they could be released to freely roam the mansion and carry on as they did prior to their exile.  So Vixx has little patience and will do whatever is necessary to scare off visitors-including  incorporating roadblocks and obstacles at every turn if it means that they want to move into her home-or even killing them.<br /><br />Supernatural occurrences and obstacles aside, a bachelor trio (Rice, Coach and Geffen) is determined to move forward with owning the place and turning it into a Pleasure Palace, despite the continual warning from their best sister friend, Sunnie Clark.  Sunnie was born with a sixth sense and she believes that an evil spirit lurks within the haunted mansion.  Of course, the fellows are cocky, arrogant, obstinate and they are more determined than ever to own the mansion and do not heed her advice.  Vexed that her years of waiting might have been in vain, Vixx has three months left to get rid of the `trespassers' and she will do it by any means possible.  But, first she must find the Achilles heel for each man.  In order, to break the curse all she has to do is take out at least one of them before the 100 year exile ends. Easy, piece of cake or is it?  Using hilarious divide and conquer methods, she plots friend against friend as she attempts to destroy their relationship and the bond that holds them together.  But will Vixx be able to break Sunny's \\"spell\\" over the men?<br /><br />Told with wit and flair, Pretty Evil is a hilarious, rolling on the floor laughing your arze off, paranormal read.  Davis successfully incorporates spirituality, romance, comedy and horror so it is difficult to pigeon-hole her book into one single genre.  Pretty Evil reminds me of a horror movie spoof or Cruella Deville meets Disney...some sections are just that kooky but creatively crafted.  This is a book that one can read at anytime without being scared out of your wits-unless you are scared too laugh too hard for fear of wetting your pants. Davis is a fresh new voice on the scene with a unique and original voice in the African American literary landscape.  I look forward to reading future books from this upcoming talent and would love to see Pretty Evil turned into a series or a movie.  Horror fan or not, this is a book that I believe will entertain and delight anyone looking for a well-written plot.<br /><br />APOOO rating:  4.5 stars.<br /><br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookCluband flair, Pretty Evil is a hilarious, rolling on the floor laughing your arze off, paranormal read.

The beginning is extremely captivating, and I figured I'd fly right through it, but once it backtracked to tell us how we ended up at that point in the beginning, I lost interest. Not to mention that it made me really mad, almost to where I wasn't going to finish it.<br /><br />Annie Knowles is married to Michael, whose a very busy OB/GYN at a Catholic hospital in upstate New York. On top of that he's helping an friend at a downtown clinic performing abortions. While his wife thinks it's ok, most of their friends and neighbors do not, and with Michael away so much Annie starts having an affair with Simon Hass, a once-famous painter that works at the college with her.<br /><br />Simon and his wife Lydia have a very disturbing background, and Lydia (who has some major issues) is part of Life Force, a church group run by the manipulative Pastor Tim. Life Force has been terrorizing Michael and his family because of the abortions he's been performing, even putting their lives in danger. What mad me so mad was Michael's absolute refusal to just stop doing them. If not for his wife's pleading, then for the safety of his two children. It was totally unbelievable to me that he would continue to put them in such danger, and I felt it was incredibly irresponsible.<br /><br />The overall story itself wasn't bad, and I was satisfied with the ending. Though it was all a bit predictable, it was a good book nonetheless. While it wasn't a great book in my opinion, I'd be willing to pick up another of Ms. Brundages' books.	2005-10-13

Nonetheless, the tales of his \\"outlandish\\" characters were a romp through \\"overly fictionalized\\" gay New York caricatures.<br /><br />However, this fifth book and supposed conclusion to the series is a diaster. Initially, Mordden strays from his formula because it appears he now is an author who \\"Has a Point to Make,\\" with overly simplified, pop-psychology analysis of gay life, with each of his supposed insights reduced to a three-point outline, as in \\"there are three types of gay love.\\" Mordden then attempts to justify his ridiculous analysis by using his characters to illustrate the three types of gay love, to no success.<br /><br />Despite the years that have supposedly transpired since the previous book in the series, the characters, nor the writing, have matured in the least. This book depicts New York gay life as vapid and superficial. As a former New Yorker, I can attest that while there are groups of vapid and superficial gay men (and straight people, for that matter), there are many more whose lives revolve around more than their CD collections and their gym-toned muscles.<br /><br />One of characters goes on at length against gay marriage, with the author's character merely saying that it was a wonderfully passionate position for which he (the author) would receive hate mail. Consider this review as one of those pieces of hate mail. If Ethan Mordden doesn't want equal rights, then I don't have to purchase or read his books, particularly if they're as dreadful as \\"How's Your Romance?\\"<br /><br />There is no plotline to speak of ... just a series of unconnected vignettes ... with no resolution or conclusion at the end of the book. Very disappointing!	2005-10-13

There are probably a million books that fit this classification, with most of them falling short of solid, landing much closer to middle-of-the-road or missing the road entirely. This is the first Updike book I've ever read and it won't be the last. In the enormous world of books, that's saying something. To me, Updike has a quality many authors do not. Defining that quality is left as an exercise to the reader, since my attempts to put it into words leaves much to be desired. <br /> <br />The book is a general story of a general man in a not-so-general relationship. The circumstance are not outstanding nor are they mundane. They are interesting to read about, regardless. While the story does not entail a common set of events a most have experienced, many of the themes are real enough to make the book easy to relate to. The topic matter is real, and you don't need to suspend disbelief to get much out of it. <br /> <br />Whenever I review books, I attempt to give the review reader my take on what I found both good and bad in the pages. I'm not sure there's much of a downside here, but I'll do my best. I suppose the ordinary sense of the story does little to separate it from a lot of other \\"real life\\" books on the market today. At the same time, you might look at that as a testament to the strong core of the book. Still, the story offers no real insight to the reader, which is why this is a good book, not a great one. Other than that, it's hard for me to find anything to complain about with this book. <br /> <br />I enjoy Updike's style and the fact he is so in touch with the real American, or human, to be more appropriate. So many hours of our lives are spent in these day-to-day scenarios that much of the subject matter is topical and easy to relate to. On the other hand, most of us don't end up in these types of stories. Still, it's easy to identify with in some ways. As they say, sex sells. Of course, itisn't that easy, since that's not really the crux of the book. <br /> <br />Adult themes are too often ignored in books these days, giving way to the endless vacuum of purported children's needs or the inane quest for love. So few books touch on the search to fill the void that burns within people. This book does almost nothing to answer the question of what that burning is, or how one might go about quenching the fire. It does, however, give the reader plenty to think about as the story explores a course of action that results from a set of choices, and what happens to the people surrounding those choices. <br /> <br />Interesting and well written. Recommended.	2005-10-13

The coming megatrend, Aburdene asserts, will not be driven by external, social, or technological forces so much as \\"the internal dimension of change\\" that will reinvent free enterprise. And she's predicting that this spiritual megatrend will take firm hold of the American way of business by, say, 2010. <br /> <br />In seven chapters the book identifies the major facets of the new megatrend, including: <br /> <br />        * The Power of Spirituality - From Personal to Organizational <br />        * The Dawn of Conscious Capitalism <br />        * Leading from the Middle <br />        * Spirituality in Business <br />        * The Values-Driven Consumer <br />        * The Wave of Conscious Solutions <br />        * The Socially Responsible Investment Boom <br /> <br />Along the way, Aburdene offers many intimate portraits of the people behind the spiritual evolution in business, from meditating CEOs to value-driven consumers and socially responsible investment counselors. In \\"Leading from the Middle,\\" Aburdene suggests that conscious capitalism will spell an end to the era of high-profile CEOs who are outrageously overpaid not only to provide symbolic leadership of corporations, but to take virtually all the credit and blame for their companies' fortunes.  <br /> <br />The question is what this and all the other \\"conscious capitalism\\" trends really portend for the future of American commerce. To Patricia Aburdene, this future will be one in which \\"the spiritual transformation of capitalism\\" will shift the American way of doing business \\"from greed to enlightened self-interest, from elitism to economic democracy, from the fundamentalist doctrine of `profit at any cost' to the conscious ideology that espouses both money and morals.\\"If the author is overly optimistic, one hopes that she's not too far off the mark. In a time when natural disasters and accelerating environmental decline are colluding with exceptional political ineptitude to stress the great American experiment as never before, it might just be the approaching enlightenment of capitalism that illuminates a sane, sustainable path ahead for us all. -- From the Fearless Spotlight Review by D.

Hughes is a true evolutionist, who recognizes that evolution is a continuing process, that the \\"cold, hard facts\\" of materialistic science and technology, are basically friendly, and that the fundamental liberal principles of liberty, equality, solidarity of persons, reason and progress are as just as real, and maybe even more important, today then at the time of the original enlightenment.\\"  <br />- Rev.

Both share many similarities; one of which is that in either society, when one enters into a business arrangement with another person, it often involves a comingling of families such that the spouses get to know each other, the children get to know each other, and so on and so forth.  Many Americans find this to be quite difficult to handle upon first encounters.  For example, many Americans doing business in China are quickly frustrated how their Chinese business partners request positions for their family members and friends.  Though it seems cumbersome, this type of arrangement serves a very useful purpose; it helps each group get to know the other group better, thereby reducing the chances of surprises down the road.      By this example, we can now examine the US-Saudi relationship over the past ~80 years, and specifically how it is portrayed in this book.  In short, the US has had a very special relationship with Saudi Arabia, and one that is built on mutual ignorance.  Specifically, when oil was discovered in the Saudi desert, American companies were so quick to get it flowing out and to the market, that neither side had the time to learn about each others cultures, norms, values, etc...  Yes, many American geologists learned Arabic and some even became Muslim.  Yes, many Arabs went on to work in America and send their children to American schools.  But overall, this exchange of ideas was limited to a small minority, even within the expatriate community of each side.  American oil workers lived in their own neighborhoods in Saudi Arabia, and Arabs in America tend to be concentrated in a few cities; i.e. Detroit.  The relationship was essentially all business.  But like any relationship between two persons or two countries, nothing is ever all business; politics sooner or later gets involved.  In America's case, the vast majority of Americans were soignorant of Saudi-American relations, that the terrorist attacks of 9-11-2001 came as such a big surprise.    This book shows the extent of the American - Saudi relationship at various levels in business, politics, and military relations.  It shows how Saudis and Americans related and dealt with each other's cultures and persons in both American and Saudi Arabia.  These including interesting stories of how Saudi women first learned about the bra; by seeing it on the wives of American oil executives and geologists.  This book also shows the lack of understanding between the two cultures and peoples, and how this is often the unstated goal of the governments of both countries; out of sight - out of mind.    This book does not go too much into Osama Bin Laden, Wahabism, Al Queda, or the extent of terrorism in Saudi Arabia.  Instead, it is more of a primer on American - Saudi relations.  Overall, a good book to read.	2005-10-13

Many Sci fi books, movies, etc.,(or ever series) are futuristic moral plays, and this book does take that track, but goes beyond that; it is a social and political commentary on our own time and well as a social and political commentary (and prediction) of our feature 50 years from now in 2055.<br /><br />The Basic plot is a Scientist named John Bennett found a way to slow down time and create a state of suspended animation (for lake of a better word). He was all set to reveal it to the world and receive the fame and accolades that would come with such a discovery; but a wrench is tossed into the gears of his life; when he finds out his one true love (Dawn Whitemore) is dying from a form of cancer with no treatment. He decides that they must go into the feature and find a cure using his new invention. The trip will be one way, for John Bennett did not invent a time machine alla H. G. Wells Time Machine, but a time suppression machine. He talked his friend Sam Tobin into going along for the ride (or Time hop) and soon enough Sam, Dawn and John were off to there first time hop.<br /><br />Before the time hop we get a look at types of people who live in our time and we are able to see how these types play out in 2055. When they arrive in the feature we see how the types of persons and trends of today play out. How the political divisions, etc., work out. Many many theories and beliefs are looked at my Mgredechian and he really makes us all think. This book gives some answers but more so causes one to have many more questions. The characters are likable and you will want to know what happens with them.<br /><br />This book 3000 years can make a great movie or series, for sure. I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in sci fi, and I would also recommend it for anyone interested in the politics, scientific advances and a cultural trends of our day. I can't wiat for the next 50 years.ears.	2005-10-13

NO other Charmed novel could possibly be better than Soul Of The Bride!!! Elizabeth's work here, is a masterpiece!!!!     What makes this story stand out from the other Charmed books is her impeccable blend of Greek Mythology and the Charmed ones tale aptly blended in. She mixed the two geneologies flawlessly, very well blended, I should add. Every single tiny detail added in is beneficial for the Charmed ones, and that's what stands out in this book. Alot! For example, the part where Piper takes a quick glance at Prue and realizes that she is still wearing Piper's necklace, makes Piper remember that she had to pay Charon the fee to take them over to the other side of River Acheron, which is taking the letter opener and mother-of-pearl inkwell, just in case. Turns out that the letter opener is useful in impaling the Sirens!!!     I'm not going to reveal details of the story, but I guarantee, whether or not you know about Greek Mythology, you will definitely enjoy this story. Soul Of The Bride is a must-have for all Charmed fans!!!!!! My fave bit is when Phoebe is determined not to give up and succumb to the tasty grub kept in Hades, only to realize they are tainted to make people an empty-headed party animal. Also, all 3 sisters had a vital part to play, and with their team work, girly (and sisterly) support, all the loose knots are tied, the i's are dotted and its a happy ending for them.     My only thumbs-down about this story is just that its seems like a pretty huge coincidence that Nikos had known about Prue's photo shoot and sent Mitchell to make sure Prue's topic is on Victorian Portraiture, using Greek Mythology, which then lures Phoebe to Hades. In the Charmed Universe, coincidence is extremely rare,unless Nikos had known it all along, and places a spell on the them to find out.       But other than that, it is 100% recommeded, you WILL love it, like I did!!!   I paid $9 for this book and every single cent was worth it!!!!	2005-10-13

It was the kind of book that Reagan and his cronies did not want anybody to read. A book that showed the humanity and compassion of the so-called \\"communist guerillas\\" that were attempting to overthrow the \\"freedom-loving\\" dictatorship that ruled El Salvador. The story is told in such a descriptive and wonderful way by Dr. Charles Clements. If anything, this book demonstrates that truth comes from actual observers and not from politicians with crooked agendas. Dr. Clements tried to open Americans' eyes to the reality that existed in El Salvador at this time, while Reagan and the media attempted to distort that reality.	2005-10-13

In the book Anna is a 13 year old girl who wants to be normal but can't because her older sister Kate has acute lukemia and Anna is gentically designed to be a donor to Kate. Feeling like she's had enough Anna decideds to file a lawsuit for emancipation and it causes ripples through the family.<br /><br />The characters were all very well written and developed over the length of the book. Anna who is trying to find herself and yet already has. Sara who as a mother thinks she is doing the best for her children. Brian who doesn't really take sides until the end. Jesse the boy who is a juvenile deliquent just wanting attention. Campbell the hotshot attorney who finds that not all things are about work and sometimes you have to be honest with others. Julia who is still trying to find love after being hurt by Campbell in the past. And Kate rounds them all off as the sick daughter who everyone wants to live but she in fact hates living the way she is.<br /><br />I really found the book as an eye opener to what if I was in their shoes. Would I make the same decisions they did or would I make different dicesions. The ending really made me cry because it was so tragic but yet it had to happen as a resolution. This is one book that will always remain one of my top favorites.	2005-10-13

Even though I've never met him, my heart definitely beats with his(!).  This book centers on Chuck looking back over his life offering personal anecdotes and examples of how modern man defines the 'good life' in today's culture - and is left wanting.  Colson, as usual, affirms the biblical worldview as the only perspective which offers the greatest joy and satisfaction in life.  It's a book for 'seekers.' Chuck is one of those great men whose testimony for Christ, and articulate expressions about the Christian worldview in so many forms, makes one happy to have him as a fellow believer.  He leaves a great legacy - although I'm sure Mr. Colson has a lot of great years ahead in Christian service.  Continue on, my friend!	2005-10-13

Harrison breaks down defending into \\"phase play practices\\" that deal with defense in the defending, middle, and attacking thirds of the field respectively.  Naturally the drills/short-sided games work well for teaching offense as well...I use the \\"Regaining Possession in the Attacking Third\\" games to also teach building the attack from the back.

I've enjoyed many other cautionary tales like this in the past, and the description led me to believe this would be another good story about how dramatically things can go wrong if people don't exercise and protect their freedoms.<br /><br />...what I got instead was an overripe propaganda piece written by someone who wraps their political agenda in a flag and preaches the doctrine of Orwell's Animal Farm, modified slightly to be \\"All people are basically good, but some people are gooder than others\\".<br /><br />As no fan of the Clintons, I enjoy the occasional joke, but the overt evil of the obvious Hillary Clinton villain in this book is just too cartoonish to take seriously.  In the first chapters, it's established that she has people murdered, is a commie-loving lesbian, serves poisoned apple pie to hungry cub scouts, and eats puppies.  Well, some of that is implied, but you get the picture.<br /><br />The gestapo-like tactics of federales is one subject, but the sheer evil motivating anyone who cashes a federal paycheck was just too much.  It's almost as if the book describes a country with a couple thousand good Christian-folk \\"just livin' the life God & Jefferson dreamed of\\" surrounded by millions of scheming villain refugees from generations of B-movies.<br /><br />I couldn't actually finish the book.  I tried.  I sat down repeatedly with it and could make it through one or two pages before actually guffawing at the ridiculous plot devices before finally setting it aside.<br /><br />My recommendation: If a first edition of \\"The Turner Diaries\\" is placed prominently next to your family bible and your kids enjoy the distinction of home-schooling un-tainted by the sinful influence of science, history, and math, then by all means, buy this book.  If the above doesn't describe you, then check out \\"Freehold\\" by Michael Williamson or \\"The Road to Damascus\\" by John Ringo, two books about the same basic subject, but without the emotional baggage saturating the pages of this creaker.the same basic subject, but without the emotional baggage saturating the pages of this creaker.	2005-10-13

This was a set of enjoyable side storys in the universe described by the previous books.  But it doesn't close the story of the Achuultani menace, infact they are hardly refered to at all.  As it's almost been ten years, I hope nothing has happened to the author.  The series realy needs an ending book! <br /> <br />  As a sort of \\"side story\\", the book could probably stand on its own better than the second book, but as the first two are so much fun, there really is no reason not to pick those up first before reading this book. <br /> <br />  Instead of further conflicts involving vast space fleets, this book gets down to the dirty, gritty, bloody, grownd combat style of old earth.  But with the twist of four youngsters using advanced technology thrown into the fray.  Readers also get to glimps how the new empire is shaping up.  Unfortunately one of my favorite elements of exploring more of the galaxy did not carry over from the previous book.	2005-10-13

I took this book with me on an ER visit, and the wait to see the doc lasted longer than it took to read this quick read. <br /> <br />There are some plot twists and plot devices that are nicely done.

This one is easily my favorite of his seven books so far. <br /> <br />Consent to Kill provides so much insight into the psyche of our hero Mitch Rapp and (without giving any plot points away) it left me really conflicted and somewhat in shock.  It's sticking with me more than a thriller usually does. <br /> <br />The action, as always is great.  The dialogue is quick and often very dry with the humor.   <br /> <br />I realize that its become a trendy thing to say, but dear god, I wish Mitch Rapp was a real person out there keeping us safe (though, after Consent to Kill, not sure how mcuh he'll have his heart in it...)	2005-10-13

I really love all of Terry Pratchett's books, but this one is probably my favorite.  The main character Rincewind (aka wizzard with no magical abilities and an ever presesnt sense of danger)  must guide the tourist Twoflower, who continually assures him that because he's a tourist nothing bad could ever happen to him.  For example, he want's to stop and take a picture of the cuddly dragon with razor sharp claws, and Rincewind insits very strongly (emphasized with running) that they leave.  Sometimes he does have a point.  Anyways, not only are the charcters amusing, but the sattire is perfect.  It's not slapstick humor, the characters create the humor.  I hate reading books where all the humor is forced and just doesn't fit,  but all the nonsense allways makes me think, \\"Why didn't I think of that?\\"...  Don't listen to what other people say about the chapters not flowing, and they don't seem like one story or all that,  it's all nonsense.  If you are actually reading the story and not just looking at the pretty pictures you'll see that everything fits.  Terry Pratchett's books are brilliant.  He deserves a nice little badge that says \\"BEST AUTHOR EVER!\\" and maybe a nice little orangutang as well.  Color of Magic is an excellent start to Terry Pratchett's colorful world.	2005-10-13

Because for all the good things I have to say about this book i have one huge complaint (and thats why 4 stars). The Quant  questions (especially problem solving) are way too simple. The actual GMAT quant questions are a lot more time consuming. Mind you they are not tougher to solve. just time consuming. I hope they release the 11th ed soon where the questions are more recent. This ed has been around for more than 3 years I think. <br /> <br />VERBAL <br />------ <br />on the verbal side this book is perfect. Its all the practice you will ever need. for all the 3 sections.  <br /> <br />If you are looking for how to solve problems this is not the book.

I think it's a lot better than Complete Divine or Complete Arcane. It has a few useful prestige classes, and several useful feats, some of which are intelligent rewrites of Song and Silence feats. I think what people react negatively to with this series of books is the fact that they're rewrites of those soft cover books that I didn't buy because I knew they'd be out in hardcover revisions later. I have to say, what I've taken from this series of books (the Completes) is a lot of useful feats, a few core classes, and about 5 prestige classes from each book. That's all they are. Which means they're probably a rip off, since I bet there is a Great Book of Feats coming out someday which will make these books all obsolete. Oh well, its a useful book anyway.

When I first got this book, I thought it was great. It has lots of cool artwork, it's about dragons, it's ... well shiny and pretty and ... I'll never use 80% of it. Unless you're an absoluted dragon fanatic whose never read anything about them in his/her life, this books will seem like a waste of time. It's very specific about what each dragon type is like, their habits, their color, their young, the way they brush their teeth after eating and adventurer, but who cares about that. Who at Wizard of the Coast decided that dragons had to fit into such stagnant, uninteresting categories? They're not crocodiles. Aside from one or two prestige classes, a small handful of feats, and a few spells, this book is a waste of money, which means I'm glad I paid $5 for it on ebay.

I was wrong. Let's face it, we buy the supplimental DnD books for feats, prestige classes, spells and a few quirky magic bits. Most of the rest of these books are pretty poor. Once in a while the author takes the theme to another level, which I think they did with Frostburn to some extent, and Libris Mortis too. Sandstorm is almost a waste of time. The races, prestige classes and quirky magics are horrible and almost useless in any campaign. A good part of the feats are the same.

I seriously almost lost track of the storyline when I first tried to read Inkspell. I had to reread Inkheart again. Anyways, Inkspell is a good book, not better than the first but not horrible! Inkspell has a lot of curse words to express the character's frustration. And it has some love parts with the main character, Farid and Meggie. Inkspell is very twisted and moves around a lot, from Meggie to Dustfinger to Farid to Meggie's parents to Elinor. Although Cornelia Funke is a talented author..... She needs to work on this book. But the ending is fantastic and keeps a little bit of suspense . Read the book to read what happens in the end. I have little hope for the Inkword trilogy, as I think that the third book of the series will be as twisted as the second book. Just read Inkspell in the library, and if you like Cornelia Funke's new style of writing,,,, buy the book.....<br /><br />The main characters of Inkspell are Meggie, an avid twelve year old reader; Mo, Meggie's loving and devoted father who is also a devoted book doctor; Dustfinger, a fire breather from the words within the book, Inkheart; Farid, a young boy read from within the pages of the book, Treasure Island; Fenogilo, the amazing author of Inkheart; Basta, the villain also from the heart of Inkheart; and finally, Resa, Meggie's long lost mother.<br /><br />This twisted plot starts with Dustfinger going back into his home world, Inkheart, while his apprentice, Farid, is left behind. In desperation to follow Dustfinger and to warn hime about Basta, Farid goes to the only two other book readers that could read themselves in and out of books; Mo and Meggie. While Meggie and Farid read themselves into the Inkworld in search of Dustfinger, Basta and Mortola, Capricorn's mother, captures Resa and Mo and takes them into Inkheart too.<br /><br />While Mo gets shot by Mortola and gets taken to the camp of the Strolling Players, Meggie finds the author of Inkheart, Fenoglio, to help him rewrite Inkheart again with the help of her voice.  As Farid reunites with Dustfinger, though, Resa sends a desperate message to Dustfinger for help. It seemed that Fenoglio had used Mo as his model to write about a robber named Bluejay. Now, the Strolling Players seemed to be afraid of Mo too.<br /><br />To rescue Mo and Resa, Dustfinger, Farid, and Meggie set off into a wild goose chase. But, Mo and Resa are captured by the Adderhead, enemy of the Sighing Prince and of the legendary Bluejay. Because of this, Mo and Resa are taken to the lair of Adderhead, with Meggie, Dustfinger, and Farid in hot chase after them...... On their way to the Adderhead's lair, Meggie receives a letter from Fenoglio that would change the course of Inkheart and would save Mo. She reads aloud from the letter......<br /><br />But, in their attempt to rescue Mo, Meggie gets captured by the Adderhead.

I don't know about 80s college parody or whatever, but Stephenson writes some great characters and the style of narration is great. This book is great because of the exaggeration and because while I was reading it, Stephenson made the extreme stuff make sense. It's like watching a movie where the acting is so good you don't even go \\"She's a great actor\\" because the performance has got you. He sets the tone of the craziness right from the start, establishing the rules where this book takes place. Sure college kids can relate to this book but that's not what makes it great. Actually I read this book and didn't think about college too much at all and I was in a FRAT! hohoho. I definitely liked this more than his later books the whole Baroque Cycle, I barely got through cryptonomicon. I like his sense of humor so Zodiac, Snowcrash, and some of Diamond Age was more my style, along with the big U. So anyways check this book out especially if you liked snowcrash.

Her style flows beautifully, making it almost impossible for readers to tear their eyes away from the page - I have rarely come across this trait of writing, which cuts down on utilising overly frivolous vocabulary, while still effectively keeping readers engaged. <br /> <br />Although I had expected that there were bound to be some 'cliches', which is hard to avoid especially with magic, Trudi has done really well in coming up with her own creative ideas. Overall, The Black Magician Trilogy is a must read for fantasy lovers. Being an avid reader, I never read books twice, since it lessens my chance of exploring other books/genres/writing styles. However, I have already broken this rule for this trilogy. Other readings that I am 'emotionally bound' to (that you might be interested in) include Juliet Mariller's Sevenwaters Trilogy and Victor Hugo's Les Miserables.	2005-10-13

It is explained that each state differs in regards to foreclosures; there is detailed information on how to become an expert in your specific state and county.  <br /> <br />This book covers every area of buying properties in this stage of foreclosure and is great for beginners as well as experienced investors. There is a throughout explanation of the foreclosure process and details on negotiating with property owners and lienholders, how different types of loans work, how to price properties, how to repair or hire people to repair properties, how to search for and verify everything to make a safe and properous investment, and much, much more. There are many helpful websites listed also.  <br /> <br />One of the most important things I found with this book is the emphasis on how to handle every step of buying these properties in the most diligent manner to ensure a safe and sound investment.  <br /> <br />If you read this very detailed and comprehensive book and still have a question, the author gives his personal email address and phone number.

All the characters in this book are actually real and I love the fact that the main heroine and hero had to learn to accept their faults and differences and that what they wanted wasn't always what they were going to get and that in itself is real love loving someone with faults and all. <br /> <br />Unlike Feehans prevous novels where the Carpathian males \\"conforted\\" their lifemates, the major premise the author conveys throughout the entire book is that Carpathian males are not human, that they have are a different race with a different set of moral societal standards therefore it is impossible to judge them by human standards because they are not human. <br /> <br />In this novel the Carpathia males portrayed were very dark, very dangerous, and very scandalous. Feehan exhibits more closely the torture carpathian males suffer were they are close to converting to vampire. She does a great job conveying their desperate anguish and dilemma and you actually for this first time see why finding a lifemate is so important to the male speicies of the Carpathian race. <br /> <br />Although there some reviews on this book who felt that the hero was a \\"rapist\\" I strongly disagree with that assumption. At no time did the hero ever actually force the heroine into forceful sexual relations he does however betray the heroine with a choice that almost shatters the complete trust of his lifemate, which causes him almost to lose her love and faith in him however the hero wins the trust of his lifemate by understanding her cultural differences and appreciating her choices and most importantly bending his domineering ways so that there can find a middle ground a necessary trait in a male and female relationship.  <br /> <br />In conclusion, Dark Secret revealed the secret of Carpathian history not really discussed in the other prevous books and we actually go somewhere with the mysterous woman who the vampires are trying to find. In addition the author communicates to the reader that no male is perfect even a Carpathian male, yet with understanding and patience you will encounter the greatest gift of all: A powerful love. <br />	2005-10-13

There is no flagging in the action, and the characters, good and bad, are extremely well-drawn. You get to know the protagonists quite well, and root for them all through the book, no matter what the danger to them may be. I look forward to reading more works from this exciting new author in the future!	2005-10-13

After reading \\"Cool Stuff\\" I am convinced we are missing the boat with what our kids need to be taught to equip them for the real world.  Unfortunately, \\"they\\" don't, but this book does. I am so impressed with the wisdom and practical advice Kent and Kyle Healy share in this book.  I was expecting it to be good and a little different than the traditional success books, but I underestimated the impact this book would have on me-- especially since I am a few years past their target demographic. Life is full of waves and I am thankful for Kyle and Kent for better equipping me to surf them.  I can't wait to share this with my three kids... maybe I can convince them I am cool.  I definitely recommend this book. One other recommendation-- buy more than one copy because you will be torn wanting to keep it and to share it with someone else.	2005-10-13

The only thing is that Yaya doesn't know about Nana, and can't remember anything. I guess the reason I like it a lot is because I can relate to her. Overall, it's a good book.

I am going to focus on the story in this collection entitled, \\"Only Partly Here\\".<br /><br />I had thought that the only reactions to what happened to New York on Sept 11 were either to put it into a political context of aggression and violence against our homeland, or to see it as too incomprehensible to articulate at all.<br /><br />Fortunately, I was wrong, and it turns out that short science fiction is the way to unpick what happened.<br /><br />Ian McEwan has said that after 9/11, he avoided invented characters and wanted to go back to school and start to learn.<br /><br />Lucius Shepard obviously doesn't feel this way as he jumped straight in and faced the challenge of articulating the experience of 9/11 through the superficially whimsical tale of a grad student and a ghost.<br /><br />Other novelists were not so strong in their vision and commitment to this task. Jay McInerney for one said that like most novelists he went through a period of intense self-examination and self-loathing after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.<br /><br />Another advantage to Lucius taking on this challenging subject matter in the tight constrictions of short fiction is that, as McInerney also says, he was incapable of reading a novel following the attack.<br /><br />Lucius has also shown the courage of his convictions.  Writing, indeed getting over a long slump in the 1990s, and keeping writing (unevenly perhaps) where other writers were distracted.  Some worked as volunteers feeding national guardsman and rescue workers, or were right by Ground Zero and so went to bed at night behind police barricades and in the odor of acrid electric fires.  Lucius was not there (as readers of his blog and movies reviews will know).  But he didn't have to be.  He took control of the situation, of the narrative of 9/11 if you will, from a distance.  He was, like Bush, elsewhere at the exact moment, but that doesn't matter.<br /><br />British and American authors (including Naipaul) have said that they agree with McEwan and that fiction seemed inadequate to the moment of a post-Sept 11 world.<br /><br />The New York Times has said that novelists have failed to engage with the \\"post 9/11 era\\".  Clearly, they have neglected to read science fiction (where Shepard is unfortunately ghettoized).<br /><br />We live in a cultural gap, an era in 2005 that debates (again) whether the novel is dead, whether documentarists such as Morgan Spurlock and Michael Moore are the only artists able to make sense of the world, and where some argue that our novelists have yet to \\"weigh in\\" and \\"make sense\\" of the events of 9/11/2001 and 7/7/2005.<br /><br />McInerney says that \\"it is to the novel that we turn to confirm our own senses and emotions to create narratives that reveal to us emotional truths.  We desperately want to have McEwan or Delillo or Roth.\\"  Interestingly, he has also said that Mailer advised him that he should wait ten years before attempting a novel about 9/11.  Mailer, the mainstream's own Lucius Shepard, counseled a slow and steady pace to analyze the vastness of the experience.<br /><br />Lucius Shepard, as close readers of his high period in the 80s will know, is never slow and steady.  He is an instinctive writer, and thus cannot analyze his own fictional processes.  His vision of how to explain 9/11 relies on the art of the fantastical.  Patrick McGrath's novella \\"Ground Zero\\" is a more complex story, and centers around a prostitute who lost a lover in the World Trade Center and is haunted by his ghost.<br /><br />The psychiatrist treating the prostitute is eventually driven mad by the events she herself failed to witness.  This is, of course, more attention-grabbing, it being a mainstream story published by a more widely read and more successfully established writer than a \\"genre\\" writer.  Unfortunately, it is also the better-written and realised story.  Shepard's is good, but in the wider understanding of 9/11 it pales beside McGrath.What McGrath also touches on, ironically, is that his is the story of mental illness brought about by being absent from the main event itself.  According to the Electric Story website, Lucius wasn't in New York during the attack.  He was in our homeland, however.  He had gone to the movies.it pales beside McGrath.

This monograph is the second to exhibit the work he has become famous for - a bare bones Northwest vernacular that owes as much to his Pennsylvania roots as it does to the Pacific Northwest.  It is readily apparent that Cutler studied under Louis Kahn in the exacting details he demands in all his projects.  He now has the luxury to pick and choose his clients which have include Bill Gates.  You get a small glimpse of the Gates estate in the Entry Turnaround in Medina, Washington.  He and Peter Bohlin worked on the project together, setting up a sawmill on the site to cut the recycled timber to their specifications.  As Cutler once said, I never look at the same detail twice, re-examining the methods and materials of construction anew in each project he undertakes.<br /><br />With the introduction of Bruce Anderson to the firm, he has begun to investigate pre-fabricated housing in the form of the Lindal Cedar Home, but you can see that it is the unique individual homes which he relishes.  He experimented with rammed-earth construction in the Residence at Meteor Vineyards in Napa Valley, creating a unique marbled finish; but it is projects like the Schmidt Residence that bear his signature in the intricate woodwork and metal connections.  This book provides you with a short but thorough look into several of the projects, illustrating that James Cutler is one of the leading architects of his generation.	2005-10-13

I would very much recommend this book, but only if you have an appropriate background in philosophical context, as to accommodate to the text's highly difficult and complex prose and content. <br /> <br />As the back cover of the book indicates, I did find this book to actually be an unexpectedly helpful and engaging guide (in spite of its difficulty) to serve as a proficient introduction to the prolific thought of this outstanding author.  The essays contained in the book span over a spectrum of about forty years; so the reader is able to glimpse the progression and difference from Levinas's earlier work to his later essays, of which the book is for the better mainly comprised.   <br /> <br />For me, these essays are paradigmatic of very technical and complex philosophy mixed with soaring religious insights into the inter-human (and ultimately highly ethical) condition.  In Entre-Nous, the reader meets in a face-to-face way why Levinas's work is so vital -- in which ontology is unravelled into ethics, as philosophy is ultimately undone into what is truly religious. <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

The grandmas are a trip and they take the reader on a trip through the beautiful desert Southwest as they track a convicted felon to a shopping mall in El Paso. Twila is a conscientious librarian but her housemate, Maudie Mae, doesn't care whether she's politically correct or not -- she tells it like she sees it. This book will make you laugh out loud. Here's the beginning of chapter one: <br />\\"Twila Dewberry had just plumped up the couch pillows, slipped off her loafers, and settled down for a good read when Maudie Mae pranced into the living room in her butterscotch ostrich leather boots. Twila marked the passage she had been reading with her finger. <br /> \\"I'm off to the Pine Knot to teach a couple of those old farts how to two-step,\\" Maudie Mae said as she threaded a leather hand-tooled belt through the loops on her jeans. The belt was embellished with embroidered insets in a Navajo design, alternating with rows of small white bones attached with braided strips of leather. The first time Twila had seen the distinctive belt, she had admired the design. Maudie Mae had rubbed her fingers over the smooth little bones and nodded solemnly. \\"These are my ex-husband's teeth,\\" she said, pausing to wait for her words to sink in, then shrieking delightedly at Twila's consternation.  <br /> Since then, Twila had seen Maudie pull the same trick on several other unsuspecting people. Even when Maudie tried the line on somebody who had already heard the joke and beat her to the punch line, it didn't diminish her delight. If the knowing suspect was a man, Maudie would fold her arms across her chest and ask, \\"You weren't fixing to propose, now, were you?\\" <br /> <br />Beautiful descriptions of the desert, a little bit of mystery, and a lot of fun. <br />	2005-10-13

Bill Phillips will guide you through the world of weight training, cardio training and Myoplex. Yes, he does push the Myoplex gig on you quite a bit, but that's okay, after-all, it is pretty good stuff - albiet a bit expensive. <br /> <br />But there is a major set-back in my opinion.

You get the whole idea behind body-for-life such as how you should be working out, exercises, exercise demonstration videos, FAQs, training tools such as a body mass calculator, fat calculator - the intensity you need to be at, a progress report... the list goes on and on (and this is all free!). In fact, i've learned way more from the website, then I have from the book. <br /> <br />Bill Phillips might do a decent job at getting you excited, but if you already know in your heart that this is what you want to do, then I suggest you dig through the website first.

As perhaps may be guessed, the book is an allegory on censorship (hence Haroun's -- the boy protagonist of the book -- journey to remove the plug that clogs the flow in the sea of stories). Less known is the fact that Rushdie wrote the book in order to explain such situation to his young son Zafar:     [Z]embla, Zenda, Xanadu:   [A]ll our dream-worlds may come true.   [F]airy lands are fearsome too.   [A]s I wander far from view   [R]ead, and bring me home to you.     writes the dedication of the book. So it is little wonder that the book is fantastic and fun. But to reduce the book to a fable for children would be to miss out Rushdie's literary prowess. I had had not just a few chuckles during the course of reading; I found Rushdie's play on words thoroughly witty, and the creativeness innate in his gregarious characters refreshing.    The book arguably might be best enjoyed reading out loud to a child. I am considering doing just so to my adorable little niece.	2005-10-13

It's supposed to be a mystery, but it's really the story of a love triangle with all the complicated emotions this situation can lead to. One thing I really liked about it was that the main character, Erin, was quite different from the usual. She is a young recently 'straight' woman coming out and sometimes she seems too stupid to be real, other times she is just like anyone of her age trying to figure out who she is and being in lust with two beautiful women at the same time.  <br />In Too Deep is a hot, unusual book for a first novel and the author's style is quite original. I'm not a big reader of mysteries, but even I could see that the mystery plot was just a device in this book. It's not really plausible and doesn't have the convincing detail you get in books by serious mystery authors. So if you buy it only as a mystery, you might be disappointed. But if you buy it as an erotic, page-turner romance by a new author who has plenty of talent, I think you'll be happy. I was impressed with it.	2005-10-13

The author is often unconvincing in writing as a woman, and Beulah's speech pattern, an exaggeration of the storytelling style typical of her rural Mississippi upbringing, relies on mind-numbing repetition of everything said and done.  <br />The story: Beulah Buchanan is a backward, not particularly bright teenager who marries a man much older than she to get away from home. The loveless marriage lasts six long years during which Beulah is used and abused, exploited by both her tyrannical husband Ralph and their venal minister, Brother Ledbetter, a Primitive Baptist preacher fond of making house calls on church members whose husbands are away from home. Eventually the worm turns, and turns with a vengeance, but, owing mainly to the repetition, it seems a long time coming, and when it does the reader finds that Beulah, till now a sympathetic character, is even worse than her antagonists. She kills her husband, gets away with it, inherits his prosperous business, and lives happily ever after.  <br />Though billed in dust-jacket notes as \\"a new take on the Southern Gothic tragedy\\" told in a \\"hilarious voice\\" evoking the comic novels of Clyde Edgerton and Mark Childress, the novel seems unsure whether to play for laughter or sympathy. No matter. Ultimately it forfeits both in invoking the reader's complicity in murder.  <br />The novel also encourages us to think of this as a story of women's liberation, of \\"a young woman breaking free.\\" And indeed the reader would like to rejoice when, in the novel's denouement, Beulah spills the beans in church on Brother Ledbetter, shoots out the lights at Ralph's funeral, tells the preacher and his congregation to put it where the sun don't shine, gets her hair cut for the very first time, buys a new outfit, starts wearing lipstick, buys herself a Cadillac, and adopts an up-yours attitude befitting the new woman she has become-except that now the reader's moral sense rebels. Murder doesn't sound like the road to freedom or liberation of any kind, and it definitely isn't funny.  <br />The author, a professor emeritus of philosophy and comparative religion at the University of Southern Mississippi, has published other books, but this is his first novel. Thus he may be forgiven for not knowing, apparently, that novels are about the struggle between good and evil, right and wrong, and that the reader's sympathies should not be enlisted in championing the wrong side of that moral equation.	2005-10-13

And I've lived in quite a few. <br /> <br />The earth's rich bounty of species are dying out one by one, human cultures and diversity are being lost, the poles are thawing, glaciers are melting, and the weather is growing more extreme. <br /> <br />This is to say nothing of the ways in which our institutions, morals and manners have degraded in the last fifty years. <br /> <br />For years, I've brooded on the question of why we're so rapaciously destroying the living systems of our planet, including our own. What's at the bottom of our seeming disregard for our very survival? <br /> <br />If you've yourself asked the same questions, then this book by Paul Stiles can provide you with answers. <br /> <br />To put it succinctly, our predicament can be blamed on \\"the market.\\" Not that the market economy is inherently evil, but that we've allowed it to run away with us. We've displaced paramount considerations of spirit with the maximization of financial profit, thereby letting \\"market values\\" become our god. <br /> <br />The chapters of this book devote attention to  a number of aspects of our lives impacted by our obeisance to the market god. These include family, esthetics, politics, education, religion, entertainment, work, environment, and possibly the most alarming, our fundamental sense of reality. <br /> <br />Unlike many books lamenting the present state of our culture, Stiles prescribes a deceptively simple solution. Namely, that we give values of spirit, such as love, beauty, and faith, equal or preferably superior status to the values of market economics and profit. In this reassignment of priorities lies the only hope for our striking a healthy cultural balance that will nudge us back toward a world where true human progress reigns, rather than the prevailing misery and suffering that afflicts so many in our time.	2005-10-13

The concept was to take the Culinary Classic of All Culinary Classics --- MASTERING THE ART OF FRENCH COOKING, Julia Child's opus that taught American women everywhere that they, too, could create great French cuisine --- and attempt to make all 524 recipes within one year. And, while doing so, she'd chronicle her adventures in a blog. <br /> <br />Starting out with simple recipes like potato soup, the assignments get increasingly more difficult. Throughout the year she is entertained and assisted by an entire cast of extras, including her understanding husband, her brother, her crazy friends, and the growing number of readers who are tuning into her blog with regularity. As Julie delves into increasingly complex recipes, such as Bifteck Sautau Bercy (her search for bone marrow for that particular recipe is truly hilarious), she learns as much about herself as she does about cooking. <br /> <br />Powell is a talented writer, and her blog remains one of the better examples of that medium to this day. Her writing style --- confessional, self-deprecating, occasionally rambling --- is really well-suited to the blog space, which makes the book version of her story occasionally feel like it's veering off-center. When she's hard at work in the kitchen, her writing is sharp and self-assured --- but Powell strays off-track a few too many times into less central aspects of her life (and especially her friends' lives) that, frankly, aren't that interesting. One wishes she would keep her focus on the food --- but when she does concentrate on that, Powell is so good you're ready to forgive her the errant lapses (at least until they happen again.) <br /> <br />At the end of the story, you have a woman who puts a lot of effort into both her cooking and her book. If the end result (in both cases) is a bit uneven,at the very least you're left with a strong and engaging woman who, through much trial and effort, discovers unknown levels of determination and ability within herself. <br /> <br />Which, if you think about it, is what Julia Child would have wanted all along. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Lourdes Orive	2005-10-13

It's a handbook of perversion, in a sense.  That's not a bad thing in and of itself, but how many nowadays have read the book?  No wonder there are incidents like Columbine every day in the papers.  Young boys (sadly, they are always boys) read THE STRANGER and decide, if Meursault could commit a murder in far off Algeria, why can't I do the same here in snowy Colorado (or wherever).<br /><br />We all suffer from existential angst, sad to say, and this book cleverly pins down the five points of fear, the points by which a good school psychologist should be able to recognize that a potential Columbine is likely to happen within a year's time.  The five points include-look at the way Meursault deals with Marie, his lovely and complaisant girlfriend.  Although he says he is attracted to her, he often leaves her for long stretches of time.  He is disaffected, as the psychologists say.  Camus isn't writing a medical textbook, more like a novel, so much of this ennui is a product of his own literary imagination.  A few years later Roland Barthes took pen to hand to compose WRITING DEGREE ZERO, in which he famously divided the author's tools into three broad sections-language (for we all must write in language), style (which individuates us from our peers), and what he called \\"ecriture\\" in response to Sartre, Camus and other existentialist novelist for whom modernism was a disastrous wrong turn in humanity's social progress toward the Good.<br /><br />Another of the five points of fear comes in Meursault's interaction with his neighbor, Raymond.  Is it me or do these guys seem more French than Algerian?  Today we would recognize THE STRANGER as an example of the colonial system gone berserk.  If you are living in occupied territory, you can't expect to feel very stable.  Spielberg and Tobe Hooper, telling the story of POLTERGEIST, picked up on some of Camus' themes when they set their poltergeist-rocked suburban home squarely on a forgotten Indian graveyard.  What is difficult for Meursault is to make a decision.  In this he reminds us of Hamlet, and as we know, the stature of Shakespeare's Hamlet was at an all-time high in the immediate postwar era, what with the Olivier film, etc.  His eternally questioning figure rang a bell with veterans and citizens weary of endless war.  For Meursault, to act or not to act are pretty much the same.  How to detect a difference?  Often we look for signs from the outside world, for example, watching a fly cross a table.  If it zigzags this way, we pull the trigger.  If it flies away, lives are spared.  Think of Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST as another cinematic analogue to Camus' STRANGER and its five points of fear.  Just the fly creeping around Jack Elam's face in the opening sequence gives you the creeps, for violence and terror depend on which way the fly falls.-rocked suburban home squarely on a forgotten Indian graveyard.

I've read it four times now and each time I gain a greater respect for Bujold's ability to tell a compelling story.  This is a difficult book to review because there is just so much going on.  The basic plot review is that Mark is back and plans to take Miles' place with the Dendarii and save at least some clones from death.  However, Mark forgot one thing--he isn't Miles and doesn't have his experience and knowledge base.  Mark also failed to recognize Miles loyalty to a brother he has never know and to his troops.  Mark also learns the hard way that people are not things and there are consequences to all actions. <br /> <br />Miles and Mark each make mistakes, misunderstand, and flounder about trying to do the right things in a situation that has no simple answers.  In the end, they each learn more about themselves then about each other but at least there's a mutual respect and a willingness to try to be family. <br /> <br />This is truly a book that you'll have a hard time putting down.  The action is fast paced, the plot threads are extremely tight, interwoven, and multi-leveled.  It's staggering that all this is told in one novel.  I laughed I cried and found myself trying to get the characters to listen to reason but alas they are already written and in the end all you can do is read on and hope that the end of the book is worth the joy and pain of the reading..  Brothers in Arms built up to this novel and Mirror Dance is a supreme payoff.	2005-10-13

China's exports - shoes, toys, clothing, tools, electronics and, more recently, cars and computers - have flooded the world market. China's trade surplus with the U.S. is climbing steadily, now more than $150 billion each year.  <br /> <br /> It is all the more remarkable that China's growth has been presided over by the same Communist Party that brought famine and social chaos in the 1960s and '70s. Now party and military leaders take part in the country's most profitable businesses. Nationalist pride is surging.  <br /> <br /> All of this raises an obvious question: What does China's emergence mean for the United States? Can China replace America as the world's dominant superpower? Ted C. Fishman sets out to explain how China will do just that. Fishman's argument is essentially that China, fueled by a huge labor market and preternatural ingenuity, is an unstoppable power that will bury the United States unless we reinvent ourselves. It is a simple theory, badly dwarfed by its flaws.  <br /> <br /> Fishman, a journalist and former commodities trader, falls blind to the innumerable obstacles China faces, like the weak rule of law, the endemic corruption and the highly politicized nature of its organizations. Fishman is ultimately unable to cut through the China mystique that has bamboozled businessmen since the 1800s. His reasoning is consistently superficial, and he is prone to grand-sounding pronouncements that are actually quite meaningless, like \\"the fact is that no matter what the Chinese machine produces for the Chinese themselves, the country's impact on the globe will inevitably and profoundly influence global life nonetheless.\\" It is tempting to dismiss this book as a flimsy economic treatise. Yet China's genuinely fast growth and its history of drastic change are compelling reasons to look more closely at the situation. Besides, the mind-set that Fishman embraces is dangerously popular with lawmakers in Washington. Indeed, Fishman's book will probably appeal most to those looking for a long-term enemy. For nativists who fear outsourcing - \\"exporting America\\" is what CNN's Lou Dobbs calls it - this book will reinforce an emotional belief that China is undermining our prosperity. A clear-eyed look suggests otherwise.  <br /> <br /> China's current boom began in the countryside, when farmers began ignoring old quota systems in the late 1970s and instead keeping money from surplus crops. China had been so battered by political turmoil and poverty that allowing a teardrop of capitalism might lighten the Communist Party load of trying to feed and house a billion poor people. The teardrop became a stream in the 1980s and then a river in the 1990s. As prosperity flushed coastal cities, more than 100 million farmers came clamoring for factory and construction jobs, and Chinese society was transformed from a rigid totalitarian state into a chaotic authoritarian one with major export muscle.  <br /> <br /> These days, leaders struggle to keep up with an economy surging beyond their control. There is no master plan directing money flow; it follows the market, inefficiently, with big bureaucratic eddies and sinkholes. The party still controls politics and has been so adept at co-opting Chinese businesspeople that no potential opposition has emerged. Yet party control over the lives of Chinese people is steadily diminishing.  <br /> <br /> It's a remarkable story. Unfortunately, Fishman cannot bring it to life. He appears to have visited several Chinese cities, but his descriptions of people and place are cardboard thin. As for his prescription for Americans, Fishman suggests better education and more study of Chinese. Hardly an original idea. And a far cry from \\"reinventing\\" ourselves.  <br /> <br /> So what about that \\"China threat\\"? It is a myth. China's economy is likely to keep growing and expand into realms like information management and software design. Trade and overseas investment will expand. A measure of freedom will continue to exist. The U.S. will continue to have persistent disputes with China over intellectual property, human rights, Tibet, Taiwan. But the reality remains that China is a moderately poor country with an uncertain political system and an ill-equipped military. It is growing fast, predominantly because it started from such a low base. Becoming a rival superpower? Nope.	2005-10-13

I found this book laying in a professor's office so I borrowed it for kicks. What a surprise to find the principle concepts of biology arranged so well as to make a quick afternoon review of the basics possible. I really like modern university science texts, but sometimes the interrelationships of concepts are lost in the flood of information from them. This book lifts the academic information fog away from those interrelationships so that they may be clearly seen. Concepts traditionally separated by chapters of information are brought together in the space of a funny drawing or two in this book. I wish I had this book before I went through basic biology, because I think I would have gotten more out of the course with such an overview. But that didn't stop me from killing all hope of a curve at exam time:)<br />By the way, although this book was published in 1991 the content remains quite accurate to this date with few exceptions, most notably the 2 page emphasis on `one gene - one enzyme' (pp114-115). This has changed now with the discovery of alternative splicing just a few years ago. But overall, the book remains a very useful overview of an incredibly fascinating field of science.<br />5 stars	2005-10-13

Most of his teachers and fellow students sound like they belong in a loony bin.    For gawd's sake, what kind of school makes freshmen dress up like hookers for \\"initiation\\"? Probably the same kind of school that won't replace missing locks for a student's locker and makes him pay for all the books that get stolen because he doesn't have a lock. That at a Roman Catholic school, no less. The principal at this school sounds like he is both a liar and a nutcase.    Notice the school never admits responsibility when something is clearly the school's fault?    I feel sorry for the author for being surrounded by so many losers, but I feel just as sorry for the rejects who hassled him as they were the products of sibling incest. It sounds like the author was one of few people at his school who didn't have 12 toes and fingers.	2005-10-13

True journalism, reporting and writing when relating to a specific topic such as sorority life, must contain some neutralism to begin with.  Therefore, this book is a poor excuse for good writing.  The author knew her intentions before she entered her underground, michevious, fake disguise.  She was out to splash to all of the world what she \\"thought\\" or maybe what she \\"knew\\" what readers would like about certain sides of the life inside a sorority house.   <br />   <br />First, how honorable is that?  Exploiting the truth in order to gain reader's interest.  That's credible.   <br />   <br />Secondly, every organization on a college campus has its ups and downs.  Every group has their bad apples; that is what makes them dynamic.  I can assure you that on most college campuses the greek systems are the ones that have the highest grades, the most community service and the highest membership in student leadership and honorary organizations.  WOW!! Who knew a bunch of drunk, bubble-headed bleach blonde girls could be studious and dedicated on their off time from having sex and doing keg stands.  Dramatic much? <br />   <br />Thirdly, has the author ever drank too much, broken up with a boyfriend, failed a test or just had a bad day?  Sucks, doesn't it.  Wait, but isn't that just life? I am sure all of these things that the author OVER-DRAMATIZES to simply just add color to her \\"book\\", she has experienced herself at one point or another.  With a sorority, you just have 100 other women there to help you through them.   <br />  Next time you want to go undercover to an organization, go in with an open mind.  Also, before you take your next book to your publisher, keep in mind he or she is probably Greek, a majority of successful people are.	2005-10-13

I really enjoyed reading the book because it was almost like three different stories in one.  The way that the author switched from one story to another was interesting because by the end they had all become one story.  I liked the way that the story was told too.  It had a lot of flashbacks from when the story actually began.  It first told of how Stanley was going to Camp Green Lake but we didn?t know exactly why yet.  Then the author got into telling the story in bits and pieces of flashbacks.  Stanley?s character also interested me a lot.  His character went from a shy fat kid who was always teased and always took it to a strong boy who stood up for what he thought and didn?t let people push him around.  The book had a narrator throughout the whole book but it also had a lot of dialogue, which I liked.  The style of the writing kept me very interested.  The chapters were very short, sometimes only two pages.  At the end of each chapter there was a little cliffhanger that made me want to keep reading.  I believe that made the book so much easier to finish.   <br />	2005-10-13

Robert Belton in this very generous and lavishly illustrated tome seeks to fill that gap by devoting a significant amount of his book to the art of Eastern Civilizations, Tribal Art and art from places from where we have very few examples - until now.<br /><br />The writing is erudite without reverting to 'artspeak' and the layout of the book, obeying the thought of alphabetizing to facilitate cross referencing, is not only helpful to the entire spectrum of art majors to art novices, it makes the book one of those to which we can turn for quick information.  Belton does not gloss over important changes in the fluid movement of art history. Quite the contrary, his writing exceeds expectations set by other 'big pretty art books'.  This is one volume that can easily be recommended to all readers interested in a fine, well-illustrated  resource book about the history of art.  Highly recommended.

But then, if it were, it would lose its primary audience, ordinary people. If you have done a lot of work in this area then you may not find much new, though I think the book is still a refreshing read.

If you have an above average I.Q. and can work through this book without the need of personal instruction, this book alone could save you the $2k that others pay for live classes (in my opinion, if you need to spend $2k to attend live classes in order to score well on the LSAT, you really need to reconsider law school because you'll most likely be winnowed out during the first year anyway- just because they let you in doesn't mean they're convinced you should become a lawyer).

It was a chick-lit read which reminded me of the television show Girlfriend.  It is about four(4)friends, Ivy League Grads, who met while they were undergrads at Harvard.  Now in their late twenties, they are dealing with life in the real world and the fast lane.  They share the same concerns as most young, attractive, professional single women--beauty, finances, weight and job woes.  Although family and boyfriends might let them down the girlfriends always have their back--whether it is a shoulder to lean on, words of encouragement or a swift kick in the butt--you can always count on girlfriends.<br /><br />Wonderful story that portrays young African American women in a professional, as well as postive, light and also shows that YOUNG women can be friends...and can be the best of friends.  FAB was a quick and easy read that captivated and held my attention until the last page.  I recommend it to fans of chick lit and those who enjoy reading girlfriend storylines.

I first encounterd here Philosophy of Logics several decades back and was impressed with its breadth, which is what I needed at the tie, but not its depth (which is what I needed later). In many ways, this book exhibits the same strengths and limitations.  First of all, there is a competent tour around contemporary pro and anti-scientism positions.  Let's face it, this is a quite a task in itself.  Secondly, there is the critique of the various positions.  This is where the limitations are found.  The book really does not add anything new to the debate, nor turnover the ground in novel ways. For instance, the chapers on the law and science and univeristy capitalism and science could have been much condensed - and more cogent material is available in some of the priamry sources.  The overall thesis of the work is that common sense has some cultuer dependencies, some knowledge dependencies and some practice (or pragmatic in the technology sense) dependencies. Hard and fast judgements are therefore defeasible and opend to revisions, but the overall success of science in explaining and predicting a range of phenomena lends it a substantial objectivity - in terms of there being a body of knowledge.  Most readers will agree with this position but arguing the epistemological nitty gritty is entirely different when it is looked over with the eye of a professional sceptic.  It is at this level that the book begins to fade, falling back on appeals to value laden ideas about success and common sense.  The argument is reminiscient of Hao Wang's support for what he called 'substantial factualism' - an appealing common sense thesis but difficult to justify philosophically without begging the question.  Unfortunately the admirable breadth of the book is not matched in depth on this point.	2005-10-12

Boyle's \\"The Inner Circle,\\" the performance of it by Richard Kramer (the book on tape), and Bill Condon's 2004 film, \\"Kinsey.\\" <br /> <br />Given that both Boyle and Condon each fictionalized their own accounts of famed sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, it is surprising how similar \\"The Inner Circle\\" and \\"Kinsey\\" are. The film is a Cliffs Notes version, while the book more thoroughly chronicles Kinsey's beginnings as a biologist studying gall wasps to eventually becoming an international celebrity with his groundbreaking work in sex research. Boyle, who has approximately 400 pages to cover the subject, gives a much more detailed account than Condon, who only had the space of a 2-hour film. But Condon still manages to include a lot of the same highlights Boyle hits upon regarding Kinsey's research and his struggle to get it. Both the book and film pick out important aspects of Kinsey's research like talking to prostitutes, his interviewing techniques to gather sexual histories, talking to child molesters, etc. Both works also address his sexual relationships with his three male research assistants.  <br /> <br />Though similar, Boyle and Condon do present much different pictures of Kinsey. Boyle tells his story via the fictional John Milk, a virginal college student who becomes Kinsey's first assistant, and so this portrayal is almost God-like, as it is told through the eyes of a young protege who sees Kinsey as a daring scientist. The film, however, speaks omnisciently, better showing Kinsey's fragilities and even portraying Kinsey's slight sex shyness (while in the book Kinsey has no sexual hesitation at all). Kinsey's wife, \\"Mac,\\" comes off as loose and carefree in the book; in the film, she is tightly wound, nervous, and more concerned with conforming with the conservative society around her. In the book, Kinsey's first research assistant, Milk, is curious about and inexperienced with sex; in the film, the equivalent character is sexually adventurous and promiscuous from the get-go. In the book, Kinsey and Milk till a garden in the nude; in the film, they merely go shirtless. <br /> <br />For a basic and rough intro of Kinsey, see the film, \\"Kinsey.\\" For a more thorough look, read the book, \\"The Inner Circle.\\" If you are considering listening to the book on tape, a warning: Richard Kramer's performance is a bit monotonous. Yes, the character John Milk, who is narrating, is supposed to be mild-mannered, but Kramer's reading is a bit dead. I really think that T.C. Boyle himself should have read for the audiobook (I've seen him read from \\"The Inner Circle,\\" and he breathes life into it.) <br /> <br />Overall, \\"The Inner Circle\\" is lackluster compared to Boyle's other works. It does a good job of telling history (a fictionalized version), but lacks the usual momentum of Boyle's page-turning style. The characters are a bit flat and unmemorable. Nonetheless it's clearly written the way Boyle writes. Expect his lucid narrative, his New Yorker-magazine-like vocabulary (i.e. succurus, insouciant, macaroni et formage), and his chapter/section endings that leave you in suspense. <br /> <br />I saw the film \\"Kinsey\\" on the single-disc DVD. Let me tell you there are absolutely no special features on it, just the director commentary. Not even the trailer is on it! There's only a preview for an Orlando Bloom/Liam Neeson film, and you can watch the film with English or SPanish subtitles, and audio track in Spanish or English 5.1 or English DTS. The producers, wickedly so, also released a two-disc special edition DVD the same time as the single disc. The special edition has loads of special features. So if you're not sure if you'll end up loving the film, you might want to rent it first, and then if you love it, buy the 2-disc edition. Otherwise if you buy the single disc first and then want a bit more, you might end up with both editions just to see some special features! <br /> <br />My Overall Ratings: <br />\\"The Inner Circle\\" book by T.C.

As he did in CONQUEST OF COOL and WHAT HAPPENED TO KANSAS, he examines the many self-serving narratives of the corporate state, showing how each story supports a pseudo-populist philosophy designed to whip up anti-elitist sentiments in order to better serve the interests of that elite.     Legitimacy, since the Great Crash, had, until fairly recently been a fairly daunting problem for business.  Now, as Frank points out, with the children of the Depression passing away, the corporatocracy and its junior partners in government have been emboldened to portray themselves as the heirs to Populism, Progressivism, and the New Deal, to advertise themselves as the vanguard of a revolutionary movement, a movement which through the millennial workings of the market is clearing the way for a new birth of freedom in the U.S.A., and throughout the world.      Frank notes, for instance, that throughout the 90s Americans were told that average working stiff could easily become the \\"millionaire next door,\\" and further, that the average guy was much better off owning stock than relying on his pension or Social Security to see him through his golden years.  So pervasive did this free market farrago become in the media, that even now, well after the New Economy bubble burst, many still hear it as gospel, believe that inevitably everything must be privatized.  So cunning has the pro-business rhetoric of the corporate state become that the average American blames himself for not being \\"entrepreneurial\\" enough, when instead Frank says he should be working to reverse the corporatocracy's 30-year rollback of worker's and citizen's rights.      A profoundly funny writer with a razor-sharp satiric edge, Frank will have you laughing out loud at the transparent self-serving cant of the corporatocracy and their handmaidens in the media, academia, and government.  Frank knows his history,and clearly sees through the latest lies of that great unregenerate beast, redder now in tooth and claw than ever before.	2005-10-12

It has short paragraphs, short chapters, and it is thin overall, but it packs a major punch with the storyline.  I admire Johnson for writing such an important book that is accessible to all levels of teen readers.<br /><br />The story is that of teen father Bobby and his infant daughter Feather, told in alternating chapters between \\"Then\\" (the day Bobby found out his girlfriend was pregnant, and the aftermath) and \\"Now\\" (Bobby's struggles as a single parent in high school who loves his daughter more than life itself).  The mystery of why Bobby is a single parent, why he kept the baby against his parents' wishes, and where Feather's mother is slowly unravels as the \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\" storylines converge.<br /><br />This is an essential piece of literature for teenagers, both male and female, to read.  Even though Bobby loves Feather, she brings a heck of a lot of stress and complication to his life.  Reading about Bobby's struggles is bound to make any teenager think again about contraception and responsible actions.  I highly recommend this short but powerful book to all teen readers.	2005-10-12

My family returned to Virginia a year or two later, and for the first Christmas after we left, some of our former Summerville neighbors sent us a copy of Charleston Ghosts. I now consider it my own little treasure.  <br /> <br />Some of the stories are more memorable than others, but I think the book does a beautiful job of capturing the mystique that surrounds Charleston and the Lowcountry. The fact that, as the author says, the places in the stories are, or were, REAL places just made the stories all the more captivating to me. On a recent trip to Charleston and Hilton Head, I actually tracked down the entrances (both places are closed to the public) to Medway, which I believe is now for sale, and Brick House on Edisto Island, only the ruins of which still stand. <br /> <br />I highly recommend Charleston Ghosts!	2005-10-12

(Come to think about it, Silver didn't get as climatic as Blue and White did.)<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love the whole series, but my favorites are the first two.<br /><br />I'd like to see the author write another one but I think that Stacy having the nightmares is getting, for lack of a better word, old. The story should have Stacy, but maybe a new Freshman at the college is the story center. Who knows?<br /><br />The author has a style of writing that is quite unlike any other books I've read. She uses the language and slang that teens use, so it appeals to a wider teen audience. She builds up to the climax of the story so well that after the second chapter, your afraid to put it down. (Especially in the case of Blue, I couldn't put it down after Chapter Two for fear of haveing nightmares myself.)<br /><br />I recomend the whole series to teenagers who like suspence, mystery, and some everyday high school/college drama (HaHa).	2005-10-12

This book is not about the current rancor in D.C., even though there is quite a bit of that in here.  It is about true conservatism towards the social compact that we all want to believe is there, and how that willingness to help the victim in the street, the person in the rubble, is what really makes a liberal.<br /><br />Contradictory?  Only on its face. Keillor makes an argument based on his home front upbringing, which we all know iconicly exists in our nation somewhere, to create a powerful tale of a political belief grown from experience, not rhetoric.<br /><br />The prose is so evocative that I found myself reminded of my own past, my own development through education and example.  This book is not so much a political treatis, but an appeal to our understanding that we are all people together.<br /><br />The writing, regardless of the political leanings, should be used as an example of how to write.  Late at night, the day's work done, I cannot get the images out of my mind.  I have found myself needing to read parts out loud to my family, having been struck by the power of the words.<br /><br />I was leary of starting this yesterday, but now I'm sorry I finished it.

US	52068296	R19K7N3SWQCWKC	0375506713	856927733	The March: A Novel	Books	5	249	274	N	N	Cry "Havoc," and let slip the dogs of war.	Mark Twain often blamed, not without some reason, the onset of the U.S. Civil War on the writings of Sir Walter Scott.  Scott's romantic view (Twain called them Scott's enchantments) of war, chivalry, and honor colored southern culture to such an extent that war became inevitable.  Any lingering romantic notions about war were put to rest by General William Tecumseh Sherman's march through the south. Sherman's view of war was simple: war is brutal and it must be fought with brutality and overwhelming strength if victory is to be achieved.  Sherman's often brutal march through the south forms the centerpiece of E.L. Doctorow's \\"The March\\".  Both havoc and the `dogs of war' form the underlying background against which the novel's plot plays itself out.    In a recent discussion about \\"The March\\" Doctorow stated that he intended to give the book a \\"Russian feel\\".  In that he has succeeded.  The broad canvas painted by Doctorow, a multitude of characters (both real and fictional) who meet, interact, and depart while war is waged all around them does contain stark similarities to Leo Tolstoy, Boris Pasternak, and Vasily Grossman.  Doctorow's unique voice and style allows him to impart this \\"Russian\\" flavor to a novel about the Civil War without it seeming imitative or derivative.  The March is an original and entertaining piece of work.    There are a host of characters in the book. Some, like Sherman, appears throughout. Others, who shall remain nameless, make an impact on the reader and advance the story but suffer untimely fates.  As with any war untimely deaths are the rule rather than the exception. The other major characters include: Pearl, a newly freed slave who father was her former plantation master; Colonel Wrede Sartorius, a German born army surgeon; Arly and Will, two Confederate soldiers whose appearance and reappearance in Union and Confederate uniforms is both amusing and ultimately suspenseful; Stephen Walsh, a Union soldier who finds himself spending alot of time with Pearl; and Emily Thompson, a southern woman who ends up as a nurse to Dr. Sartorious.    Doctorow devotees will recognize Dr. Sartorious as the evil Dr. Sartorius featured in Waterworks. They will also recognize the freed slave Coalhouse Walker as the father of jazz pianist Coalhouse Walker Jr. from Ragtime.  These `coincidences' are not central to the plot but does engage the reader with background information about the characters not readily apparent from the reading.    The book progresses along with Sherman's march.  We see southern cities burnt down at the least sign of resistance and we see captured Union soldiers executed without cause.  War is indeed hell and the havoc of war is omnipresent.  Doctorow is unstinting of his portraits of all his characters be they northern or southern.  There is no such thing as a romantic hero; there is simply brutality in the name of survival and accommodation to the dogs of war barking at everyone's feet.    One noticeable element of The March is the easy transformation of the characters into different versions of themselves.  Will and Arly's rapid changes are the most evident of them. So too is Pearl's transformation from a timid slave girl into a Union drummer boy and then a nurse.  All around the novel such changes abound.   The war, for all its brutality, provides many of the characters in the novel with the freedom to change themselves and society's perception of them.  The boxes to which we are consigned are put aside and we are then free to create our own version of ourselves free from a peacetime society's constraints.    The novel ends as the war ends.  The end of the novel is as ambiguous as the end of the war itself.  There is certain optimism that freedom (whether from slavery or society's pigeonholing) gained will not be lost once the fog of war lifts.  The reader may know better than the characters how unfounded that optimism was but the characters do not and their nave hopes makes them all the more poignant.    The March is a fine book.	2005-10-12

Using enthralling stories of his actual accounts with these people and his remarkable talent as a writer and storyteller, he is able to take the reader through an insightful journey into the minds of the self-injurer.  I found this book to be extremely captivating.  I could not put it down.  It is written in a way that makes the reader feel he or she is actually in the room during the sessions.  I have attended one of Levenkron's lectures a few years back and despite the allegations I've read online, I did not get the same impression of him in person.  He did not act as if he were \\"god\\" although for any therapist to treat these endangering disorders, as he does, on a daily basis, I expect must have the patience and understanding of one.  He comes off as a genuinely compassionate and confident person with a down to earth personality.  This heartwarming book takes a very misunderstood illness and breaks it down to a comprehendible, not so mysterious condition that affects an estimated 2 million people in the United States alone.  It offers sufferers and their families comfort and hope in the midst of chaos.   Thank you for this important book.	2005-10-12

The book \\"Tony and Me: A Story Friendship\\" is Jack Klugman's loving tribute to his long time co-star and dear friend the late Tony Randall.  The book covers the extent of their decades long friendship from their first meeting on the set of a 1950's TV show, to their days on \\"The Odd Couple\\", to Mr. Klugman's battle with cancer and ultimately with the passing of Mr. Randall in 2004. <br /> <br />Although the book is not autobiographical Mr. Klugman, nonetheless, does spend the first couple of chapters detailing the path he took to become an actor.   If you are a fan of \\"The Odd Couple\\" or Jack Klugman these chapters will provide some interesting incite into the man. The author spends the balance of the book recounting various stories and anecdotes of their career together. <br /> <br />The book is short (less than 150 pages) and I was able to read it in a single sitting.  It is an at times a funny and very touching book.  I found myself laughing out loud more than once and even getting choked up on a couple of occasions.  The love Jack Klugman feels for Tony Randall is palpable as you read through portions of this book. <br /> <br />As a bonus, the book comes with a DVD containing out takes from the \\"The Odd Couple\\".  This 15 minute DVD, introduced by Jack Klugman, contains some extremely funny out takes from the series.  It alone is worth the price of the book. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of  \\"The Odd Couple\\", or Jack Klugman, or Tony Randall or just of classic TV I highly recommend this book.  The investment of time needed to read it is minor compared with the enjoyment you with derive.   <br />	2005-10-12

In the current field, filled with recollections of growing up in alcoholic, schizophrenic and other dysfunctional families, Daniel Becker's book stands out as a straight-forward story about growing up with an anorexic mother and it's effects on his brothers, his father and himself. Becker's mother was diagnosed with adult anorexia at a time when very few had heard of the word much less knew how to spell it. The author  not only provides the reader with a great deal of information about the disease but writes about its consequences upon the entire family dynamic.  Above all, this is an honest attempt by Becker to make sense of his own childhood as well as This Mean Disease's effect on his adult life.   <br />	2005-10-12

Though God created something out of nothing, the artist uses that which already exists, and shapes it into a new form. This purely aesthetic creative function is one of the central attributes that separates man from other living creatures, and when the new forms are used to glorify God, a special union takes place between the artist and his Creator. It is this particular form of imagery that Pope John Paul II addresses, giving this slim booklet special meaning for those whose endeavors are in the religious art genre.<br /><br />Some of the finest art known to mankind was inspired by faith (and much of it sponsored by the Catholic Church). These masterpieces are a far cry from what sometimes passes for art in our present age of quick fortune and fame, and that receives attention from the media and galleries, where \\"being outrageous\\" has often replaced skill and true inspiration, as well as beauty that has transforming power. He writes that an artist must not have a \\"craving for cheap popularity\\", but labor for something much greater, and \\"enrich the cultural heritage\\" of the nations and humanity. As Dostoevsky wrote in The Idiot, \\"Beauty will save the world.\\"<br /><br />Pope John Paul II speaks of how the Church needs art, to bring the invisible mystery of the Gospels into form and color, as well as how artists need the Church, which offers \\"a horizon especially rich in inspiration.\\" Christian artists will appreciate this essay on the relationship between faith and beauty, and their responsibility to achieve their highest goals. Veni, Creator Spiritus...\\"Come O Creator Spirit, visit our minds, fill with your grace the hearts you have created.\\"	2005-10-12

Amazing, mesmerizing; a tasty dish of words, a sense of humor to offset the many injuries the major characters suffer.  I can tell Pat Conroy LIVES.  His way with words is so brilliant, so funny, so deep.  He never turns away from the darkest images, such as the suggestion of incest when he talks about his little girls' behinds. His subject matter is not new: Life is funny, life is terrifying, people love, people hate, people have &#34;inappropriate feelings&#34; and do horrible things to each other.  Yet most of us survive.  Conroy is clearly a survivor, and can tell this story of horror and passionate love of family because he knows what happens when the twistedness of a parent and the shackles of blood ties to family and home combine in a suicidal mess.  Conroy puts all this together in his perhaps sixth book,  I consider his masterpiece. Conroy has recently published his most revealing book, The Losing Season, so that we know that portraits of his parents, his brothers, and his own profound misery and joy spring from the fountains of his younger life.  The reader may disapprove of self-revelation, although it is well-disguised in &#34;Prince of Tides&#34;.  Perhaps this is why it is his grandest feat of story-telling. I refused to read &#34;Prince&#34; for years and years, having seen it in bookstore windows, flying rapidly away with each ding of the cash register.  How could a bestseller be anything but something to read on the beach or the bus?  Finally, someone forced me to borrow it, and it was at least a three-day, non-stop love affair with Conroy's humor, grief, profundity.  A volcano of ideas, a superior intellect comparable to the best writers of our time.   Many people have published books, and some are fabulously entertaining.  But a select few are recognized by a large audience as genius (Roth, Atwood, Irving, LeGuin, Kesey, Winterson, to name some popular authors who are also read as serious writers).  Conroy should be among these supreme talents, and &#34;Prince of Tides&#34; may well be recognized as his most original, complex, and best.	2005-10-12

This book is an amazing source of information and inspiration.  I want to give it to everyone I know who has a home, and who cares about the health, comfort and sustainability of their home, and the environment.  There is so much information here, that you will be dipping into it, and referring back to it, for years to come.  The author takes you room by room, offering tips, recipes, and suggestions for ways in which you can make sure that you are surrounded by, using, cleaning with, and enjoying natural (not chemical)products and materials.  Everything is here...from natural cleaners, to building materials, fabrics and fibers, heat, water, what to do about mold or mites, personal care, colors, ventilation, pet care, etc., etc.,   While the author shows you what to look out for, what to be concerned about, and why, she does so in a way that really explains issues (rather than sensationalizing them), and she provides you with the information, suggestions, and inspiration to make other choices.  This is a guide to making your home the sanctuary you wish it could be.  The resources at the back of the book--alone--are worth the price, but it is Annie Bond's voice, her expertise but also her down-to-earth style that makes this a book you will love to own and to pass on to others!	2005-10-12

Admittedly, it is not something that I'm used to doing, and sometimes it really takes an immense amount of concentration, but I have had the experience of changing sadness into joy as a result of what I've learned from this book. The way we feel about ourselves is a habit that we develop as we move through our lives, and it's a damned hard habit to break, but it is possible to have control over our feelings. It is possible to feel good even when a relationship is ending, or when you're experiencing financial challenges. I've done it!! It is possible to look at the pain that we sometimes experience in life as healing rather than as debilitating. I realized as I read AAIIG for the first time how I really felt about myself, and how I really felt about the life I was living, and the life around me.<br /><br />It is very easy, if we live only by our 5 senses, to arrive at the conclusion that life is unfair, or that life is a struggle. What Abraham and the Hickses are suggesting is that most, if not all, of our opinions about life are learned. Think about it for a minute. If you're born into a rich family, you grow up thinking about money, and yourself in relation to money, in a totally different way than if you're born into a poor family. If you're born into a loving home, the same principle applies. Abraham is suggesting that it is possible that we all come into this world in joy, desiring to live a joyful life, but that that initial spark is eroded by our childhood and early life experiences.<br /><br />Abraham also suggests that we make decisions about life based on our experiences. How is it that two children born into the same household can grow to live two completely differentlives? It must be because one of them made different decisions than the other one, despite the fact of having similiar childhood experiences. Ultimately, we are all individuals making individual decisions about the life, and that is a very, very valuable lesson ... at least, for me it was truly eye-opening.<br /><br />Even if you are an absolute literalist who does not believe in life before birth or life after death, you can still benefit from the exercises at the end of the book. None of us knows for sure whether anything beyond the evidence of our senses is true or not. Some of us follow only the evidence of what we can see, and taste, and measure. There are others of us who supplement our senses with intuition. My intuition guides me to the possibility that there is more to life than we can sense immediately, but even if you think that this is a crock, read the book once all the way through and then decide. Take note of the things that you might disagree with and keep on reading. You might be surprised that you agree with what is being presented far more than you disagree with it.	2005-10-12

The late Professor Winks and Professor Kaiser have produced a gem of a book for the student historian. Europe, during the period covered by this book, saw a vast amount of change. England disposed of its royalty only to reinstate it, with Charles II, France became a republic, new lands/cultures were being discovered, the age of enlightenment was born and the industrial revolution occurred. Newton was discovering gravity, Voltaire was writing, Gainsborough painting and Haydn composing. The authors have covered all of these topics, and more, in a readable way that isn't weighted down with heavy prose. There are many illustrations scattered throughout which add to the enjoyment of this book.<br /><br />At a mere 199 pages it is not a text that covers any of these events in any great depth, but what it does do is to give a good introduction to them. Although concise it is not lacking relevant information. After reading this book, the student should have enough knowledge to discuss the important historiographical points from the era. The numerous references point the reader to other texts that will expand their knowledge should they need to. This is an excellent addition to the bookshelf.	2005-10-12

Its specialty is its biblical-theological nature. McConville interprets each passage in the light of the broader theology of Scripture. Rather than appraoching each passage as though it stood alone, he excels at synthesizing it with the broader theological context. So for an interpretation of Deuteronomy that is scripturally broad and thought-provoking, this is the one. However, McConville has been strongly influenced by James D.G. Dunn. McConville's interpretation of one of the most important passages in Deuteronomy (30:1-14) is strongly influenced by Dunn's maverick interpretations of Romans 10 (which quotes Deut. 30:11-14). I was very disappointed that McConville, who often shows real insight in disproving liberal opinion, swallowed Dunn hook, line, and sinker.	2005-10-12

Within that distance the book (a joint effort published by the Garrett County Historical Society) lists and describes about 30 coal towns, most of which are ghosts or barely still in existence. A few places such as Kitzmiller and Bayard are still very much alive and even support post offices yet. The most interesting feature of the book is the inclusion of a large number of photographs and postcards of most of the towns - some of them taken shortly after one or another of the numerous floods that occur along this mountainous stretch of Potomac River. These coal towns seem gritty and fragile places, though stubborn in their existence: many of them could only be entered or left via the railroad. The book is an interesting look at once thriving places of not too long ago that may or may not have seen better days.	2005-10-12

But now in Ron Powers's holistic Twain book we see the parts  finally coalesce into the whole fascinating fellow. <br /> <br />Twain was impish, outrageous, sentimental, crass, heroic, vituperative, venal, generous, vain, insecure, self destructive, self regenerating, almost mystically prolific and uncompromisingly brilliant but above all passionately human. Thanks to Powers's watershed book, we can see just how human. The many letters from which he has quoted contain Twain's trademark yin yang of self deprecation and hilarity.  The narrative is so seamless that there are times it is difficult to see where Twain's writing leaves off and Powers's begins.   <br /> <br />Most are accustomed to the beloved Twain of both white suit and hair (and occasional red socks) featured center stage, spouting quotable humorous yarns, culminating with the zinger of truth. In Powers's book, Twain is still in the spotlight, but now the house lights have been turned on to reveal the rest of the cast.  What a cast, and what a stage America was!  Twain starts strutting America's proscenium in the mid 1800's when the country traveled by horse and buggy or river steamboat. He goes from preteen unpaid cub typesetter and nascent reporter to Mississippi riverboat pilot, then carouses through the gold pixilated West, making his bones as mining town reporter where facts were meant to be flexible. Later he starts his lecture circuit, eventually becoming as famous and apparently as temperamental as the most worshiped of our contemporary rock stars.  Mark Twain as chick magnet.  Who knew?  <br /> <br />Back East, he finds his mentor and eventual life-long friend, editor-critic William Dean Howells; writes his first smash hit, the comic travelogue \\"Innocents Abroad,\\" then meets, woos and weds his dear aristocratic Livy. He travels, publishes more books, pens \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" and much later his masterpiece \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\\" <br /> <br />Twain criticizes but personally revels in the wealth of the \\"Gilded Age\\", (which he named in a novel of that title), throws lavish parties and rubs shoulders with writers, generals, presidents, and robber barons. Eventually he even turns publisher of Ulysses S. Grant's memoirs, rescuing the dying general's family from bankruptcy. All the while he is writing letters by the basketful to family, friends, and foes. Somewhere In the process of traveling to write travelogues and lecturing to repay debts, he becomes world renowned. In the end, despite losing a fortune and most of his dear family, and having to lecture to repay his almost infantile business investments, he never stops observing, writing \\"appearing\\" and critiquing his 19th century even into on into the nascent 20th century. Twain endures.  <br /> <br />In addition to his humor, Powers highlights Twain's revolutionary literary voice; his unique take on `our' particular American voices. In an age characterized by \\"polite\\" Victorian prose, Twain wrote in the American vernacular, not to ridicule, but to capture and popularize the cadences of ordinary people for the first time. The voices of Huckleberry Finn and Jim explode the myth of the contented slave in a time when people still hung on to the concept of slavery as divine right. There are other voices in the book. The voices of Twain's contemporaries as seen by Twain pop to life in his correspondence and are further lovingly delineated by Powers.  Of course there is the actual written or spoken voice of Twain as lecturer, letter writer, critic, and occasional mock rube.  Again, the voice.  It's his humor, his humanity, his self deprecation and his passion for life that we hear. <br /> <br />If you are used to dry biographies, throw away your pre-conceptions.  This book has been written by someone with a unique voice.  It is scholarly, but graced with wry humor, it's informative, but above all, it is wildly entertaining.  Twain is never ever dull.  He could not have chosen a biographer with a voice more suited to his work.  <br /> <br />Joan Hibbard Ryan <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

US	52678596	R23YU9B81DTOKC	0785202684	294301409	Holy Bible King James Version Giant Print Reference Edition/Burgundy Leatherflex	Books	5	89	89	N	Y	Excellent value	First let me say that the product description is incorrect.    The edition appears to be 1976 and it is bound in a high-quality grained black leatherette, not burgundy leather.   <br /> <br />In all other respects, the binding is heritage quality.  It will lie flat on any page, and the detailing is meticulous: gold leaf on the outside of the pages, gold braid ornamentation on the inside edges of the covers, burgundy and gold heavy thread at the top and bottom of the spine stitching. <br /> <br />The paper and ink are top quality.  I could not believe this was a full large-print bible when I picked it up.  It is light and only 1.5 inches thick, so you can read it while holding it in your hand.  But although the pages are thin, you can barely see the print on the converse of a printed page (although you can see through empty pages to the next page).  The printing is crisp and clear, and will not smudge.  There is a ribbon attached to the binding to be used as a bookmark <br /> <br />The typeface is a traditional serif proportional font, either medium or bold.  Notes (cross-references, alternate meanings, etc.) are done in smaller light sans serif typeface at the end of each verse.  Each verse is indented, but there is a symbol to show the original paragraphs.  The pull weight of the pages is very high.  (I.e. the pages can't be pulled out and should not fall out, very important in a flat-lying book.) <br /> <br />I have found this Bible easy to read in every respect.  There are three nice extras:  a basic concordence at the back, four thick coated double-side pages of traditional family Bible recording matters (marriage, children, deaths etc.)in the very front, and four similar pages of excellent maps at the very back. <br /> <br />I don't *need* large print, but it really increases reading comfort and saves eyestrain for anyone without perfect vision.  I have had it for 6 months and so far it appears to be durable -- mine looks like new, with no torn pages, smudges,or scratches. <br /> <br />Actually, even if you would be happy with a hard-bound book volume or paperback, you might be happier with this one, due to its durability, its ability to lie flat, and its light weight.  You certainly won't get a leather-bound Bible of this general quality for @ $14 (in fact, you aren;t going to get a fine leather binding for $14 no matter what's inside). <br /> <br />In summary, this Bible is a phenomenal value if you want a top-quality, well-made Bible to read frequently, which looks like a traditional, expensive Bible.   <br />	2005-10-12

Standing alone this is excellent literature.  Such angst over word usage as I have read in prior reviews seems an immature reaction to the very inconsequential.  I will simply state this, I have NEVER read novels that so tightly weaves me with the main protaganists.  I feel like I know these people.  Other popular series may have great writing, plots, pace, intricacies, but none connect the reader so intimately with it's characters.  Disclaimers regarding this series' length should be given but each book and especially the first deserves a review on it's own merit.  That being said IMHO the first three books of this series could stand alone as the greatest fantasy trilogy ever written and I have read most.  And this is written by one who admits to having become greatly frustrated at this series protracted length and lack of resolution of major plots.	2005-10-12

I had a tape of his when I was a teen and loved his humor and wisdom.  However, I have heard from enough sources to know he is a liar and maybe not a Christian after all. Jesus warned us that not everyone who says, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom. He also said we will recognize false prophets by the fruit they bear. In other words, action speaks louder than words. How sad that Mike isn't what he seemed. I am glad though, Jesus is, and I am reminded he(and his word) is the only one I can totally trust.  <br />\\"Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.\\" Proverbs	2005-10-12

Contrary to some reviewers, I found the main character, Lisa, very realistic and sympathetic.  I did wonder repeatedly WHAT she found appealing in her love interest, Strauss.  I kept rooting for the relationship to end.  I could not help wonder how miserable she would be in another 5 years, after the \\"happy ending\\".   <br /> <br />It was strange that an author that seemed so clearly PRO a strong female character and pro her complicated, openminded outlook on life would resort to sublimating her to an egotistical, controlling, narrowminded, unempathetic character.  Long before the book was over, I was dreading what I feared would be the ending (and I was right).  There is so much promise for the story to resolve in (my opinion) a better way, but as I read I saw my hopes slipping away. <br /> <br />I agree that it is strange that Lisa has no friends other than her cousin, her strongest ally and champion.  Why oh why did he push her to stay with someone so clearly BAD for her?  The relationship with her cousin was so much healthier and satisfying, that I kept hoping (in a bizarre way) that they would somehow get together - of course this is not possible, so I hoped that he would help lead her down a happier path.  NO GO.  In fact I resented the conclusion that he had held her back.  It seemed to me that she was lonly so just settled with someone in order to survive her grief. <br /> <br />Too bad.  I hate to see Lisa turn into a mirror image of her mother in 30yrs.  I suppose you could call this realistic, a lot of people marry the wrong person for the wrong reason, I just hoped for better. <br /> <br />I agree with other reviewers who were curious about her family relationships and would have liked to see these developed more. <br/> <br />Overall, I would read another Ciresi book, in fact, look forward to it, I just hope it's a little more optomistic in it's view of \\"happy endings.\\" <br /> <br />PS I do agree that the Lesbian boss was a complete stick-in-the-mud steriotype.	2005-10-12

When a person is grieving, or otherwise having a very hard time, what does one say or do without going overboard? This book gives the answer. <br /> <br />Here are some examples. If someone close to you has recently lost a loved one or has been in an accident, send them a card, to express how you feel. Really listen when someone tells you about their day. Call your parents and/or siblings for no reason, other than to say that you love them. Be open to constructive criticism from someone you admire and respect. Read to a child. Call or visit your grandparents and ask them to tell you stories about themselves when they were younger. <br /> <br />Remember someone in your life who has died. Call or visit a person you know who also knew this person and talk about the great times the three of you had together. When invited into someone's home for a gathering, always bring a small gift of appreciation. It is only in the silence that we can hear God's voice. Become your own best friend. This way you will never be lonely. Help an elderly person carry their groceries to the car. Practice patience. Find at least one positive characteristic in everyone you meet. When talking to someone in a wheelchair, lean over or sit down, to be at their eye level. Get involved in at least one \\"cause\\" to make this world a better place. <br /> <br />This is a really good book. At one time or another, everyone will need a book like this, or knows someone who will need a book like this. It's short, with one suggestion per page, it's very easy to read, and it says a lot. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

Therefore the federal government will then-step in and sanction those same schools for their 'failure', and perhaps create a backdoor to privatization.<br /><br />In the process, NCLB comes down the hardest on some of the same groups who had actually hailed it's passage in the attempt to equalize educational quality. The civil rights groups hailing the law had good intentions, but they did not scrutinize how the law ultimately would evolve during implementation.<br /><br />America's decentralized education funding system (p.6) increases the chasm which students and their schools are expected to cross to recieve a 'good' education. We continue giving different groups of kids different quality resources and then seriously expect them to have exactly identical results. Consequently, the implemented law now stresses educational equality of testing results--which in turn, supposedly judges if a child is 'smart'.<br /><br />Everything being tied to the results of one test places a significant amount of pressure upon anybody. I can only imagine what it psychologically does to a public school student who has honestly tried the best they could--and might have even loved to learn.<br /><br />The federal government insists that all children can process information in the same exact manner--those who cannot will be penalized for their 'difference'. This itself is an excuse to undermine special education and that program's emphasis on 'individualized education plans' for eligible students. For that matter, it also attacks bilingual education and other programs which have recognized that the nation's students are not little robots in training.<br /><br />With emphasis on rote memorization, another criticism of this law is that it dumbs down the United States public education system. Because the poorest school districts are having to allocate what monies they do have to the testing program, they cannot teach their students the critical thinking skills which would help them attend college. Only the richest (and not incidentally whitest) school districts in America would be able to steer their students towards a college track--provided those students were even encouraged to stay in the school.<br /><br />While schools cannot openly exclude the neediest populations anymore, I am concerned that these student groups could be pushed out in order for a school to improve it's test score ranking--and avoid receiving federal sanctions. Never mind if that student is actually attempting to learn in the classroom. Never mind if that student has a perfect GPA and successfully performs 'college prep' work.<br /><br />I also appreciate that this work has ideas for overhauling that same law. Identifying a problem is empowering, but eliminating it enables people to make real change in their communities. This is an important book for educators, public officials, parents, community activists, and/or the students affected by NCLB.

First of all, the book comes wrapped in plastic, so you can't check it out first - a real downside, I think. <br /> <br />It's a neat idea, and I'd hoped the book would be a real aid for knitting brainstorming and planning.  Unfortunately, it's heavily weighted towards the figure-outline design pages, which are only good for designing sweaters.  I'd like to have something to prompt accessory ideas, and more of the knitting-journal features.  There are only 12 spaces for \\"things I've made\\" entries, and a handful of \\"projects I want to knit\\" require a full page each. <br /> <br />The yarn inventory page is a neat idea, but, as previous reviewers have said, I don't know how well the book would handle having bits of yarn taped inside it. <br /> <br />The journal would be made much better with more project pages, and maybe some pages for a wish list without pictures.

The minor characters you hear from get just enough face time to be interesting without bogging you down with too much detail.  A few pages from their POV will give you what we used to get: a quick look into who they are, what they are thinking, and where their loyalties lie.   <br /> <br />The plot seems to move forward across the board and the Last Battle is no longer some distant event we are working towards, it is coming and coming soon.  As you read it becomes more and more obviouse that things are really heating up.	2005-10-12

There is Blue, of course, Slippery Soap, Magenta and Periwinkle, Shovel, Pail and Mailbox, also Tickety,  Side Table Drawer and Mr. and Mrs. Salt and Pepper.  With all of these characters this book sounds like it's big, but it isn't.  (The only drawback really... a little short at 10 pages.)<br /><br />Take a look at the \\"search inside this book\\" Amazon feature to see what the text and artwork looks like.<br /><br />On the first set of pages (pictures take up two pages) Blue is in the bath tub.  The text begs you to join in and sing Blue's favorite song:  Old MacDonald's Farm.<br /><br />The second set of pages show Blue reading a book with Periwinkle and Magenta.  The text refers to the Hey Diddle Diddle poem and asks \\"Do you know this rhyme about a cat and a fiddle?\\".<br /><br />The third set of pages show Blue using her imagination.  The clouds in the blue sky overhead give you the opportunity to ask your child what the clouds are shaped like.<br /><br />The fourth set of pages shows a garden in which Blue is trying to find some of her friends.  There are vegetables to discuss with your child, as well as flowers and the colors of various plants.  Your child also has a chance to find Shovel and Pail and Mailbox.<br /><br />The final set of pages has the text \\"Of all the things Blue likes to do, she especially loves to play Blue's Clues with you!\\"<br /><br />Four Stars.  A fun book for baby and toddler.  It gives a caregiver some opportunities to teach and have fun.  We only wish it was longer.	2005-10-12

One is that you can have a great, scientifically accurate books that is populated by one-dimensional characters. The other is you have great characters but at the expense of getting the science right. Wilson is one of the few writers out can combine both--the big scientific idea with well-round characters and make it all work. His last two novels have been short-listed for the Hugo and I'd be willing to bet Spin makes it up there for best novel again this year. And the way Wilson writes, it's only a matter of time before he gets over the top and claims the big prize.<br /><br />But back to Spin. Spin is the story of three-friends, told against the back-drop of the huge event of the stars suddenly vanishing from the sky and finding out what cuased it. Turns out Earth is in a shield that protects it from time passing more rapidly outside the barrier in the rest of the universe. It's an intriguing premise and one that Wilson explores well, but not at the expense of his characters. The story is first-person narrator, Tyler, and chronicles the realtionship our hero has with fraternal twins--a brother and sister, Jason and Diane Lawton. Indeed, there are times when the big idea story takes a back seat to the characters, but then Wilson will tie in the situation and show us how it affects these characters. A great novel and one that firmly cements Wilson as one of the best contemporary science-fiction writers out there today.	2005-10-12

The Generous Gardner' is no exception. Smart, witty, and fantastically fun this book had me giggling from beginning to end.  <br /> <br />Fran March has created a lovely, idyllic life for herself and her teenage daughter, Rosie, in the village of St Ceridwen's Well, with Fran's handsome but selfish husband Mal. Fran has a successful career as an illustrator and as a budding cartoonist, but all too soon everything begins to change with the arrival of two men from Fran's past that threaten to force her to expose the one, tiny, little secret she has kept hidden from everyone over the years; that being the father of her daughter Rosie.  <br /> <br />Soon the garden clippings are flying everywhere as old boyfriends try to re-stake their claim, evil neighbors plot to ruin her marriage, and just when she's thinking it couldn't get any worse, her husband accepts a job in paradise for himself, leaving Fran to wonder what has happened to her Eden?  <br /> <br />Ashley is at her very best here with loads of warm, belly-laugh-moments and self-deprecating humor that will strike a chord with every woman. And speaking of 'every woman,' it's always, nice to be able to check in with old friends from Ashley's past books and happily we are given that opportunity as both 'Charlie Rhymer 'from 'Every Woman For Herself' along with her alternative woman's magazine 'Skint Old Northern Woman,' (how do I subscribe I wonder?) and, horror author 'Cass Leigh' from Ashley's last book 'Singled Out' are both mentioned. <br /> <br />No doubt about it, another winner for Trisha Ashley!

I was studying (at that time) astronomy and mathematics, so the first college-level physics class I took fully incorporated calculus and advanced mathematics. It was not until recently, as I took a position as tutor at a local community college, that I discovered a rigourous introductory physics text that did not involve calculus (only one semester of calculus is offered at the college, and usually taken concurrently with or after physics).<br /><br />Walker's text, second edition, is the text we currently use. We offer one semester of physics, so we only get half-way through the text, which seems designed for a two-semester sequence. As the main focus of the college is technical, so the sections on mechanics, thermal physics and electromagnetism are the most essential sections for our degree programmes.<br /><br />While this text does not assume calculus, it does assume basic trigonometry and analytic geometry. Dealing with angles and graphing are important skills to know here; dealing with vectors is introduced very early in the text, and continues to be very important throughout.<br /><br />The book is well organised, with chapter summaries, problem-solving techniques summarised at the end of chapter, high concept questions, drawings, photographs, and real-world applications that relate the theory back to actual experience. From the light refraction in raindrops to the workings of the Global Positioning System, students will learn more about the interactions of the world from this text.<br /><br />The examples follow a format that shows not only the worked solutions, but also the strategies employed to get to the solutions. Problems are pictured (after all, physics deals with real, substantial things), and conceptual considerations are explained (physics is largely story problems that need to be set up properly, after all). The insights and further considerations from the solutions are explored, and other practice problems are suggested (physics is always about going on to the next problem). The examples follow different categories - there are active examples, conceptual checkpoints, and real-world physics exercises.<br /><br />The book is divided into five primary sections: Mechanics; Thermal Physics; Electromagnetism; Light and Optics; and Modern Physics. Mechanics largely deals with motion, introducing near the end ideas of gravity, sound, fluids and energy. This leads into Thermal Physics, the study of heat, temperature, and the laws of thermodynamics. Electromagnetism looks at electric force, charge, current, potential/potential energy, magnetism and flux. Light and Optics continues this with electromagnetic waves, proceeding to optical instruments and issues of interference and diffraction. The final section on Modern Physics deals with `fun stuff' like relativity, quantum physics, atomic and nuclear physics and radiation.<br /><br />Like most texts, it comes with various supplements for students and teachers, computer-based and web-based. There are pocket companions and workbooks with solutions that can also be obtained, related to the text.<br /><br />This is a good text for classroom study, and also a text for independent study. Some of the exercises are difficult to work through, but there are literally dozens (sometimes hundreds) after each chapter, so there is plenty on which to practice, and all the odd-numbered exercises have answers supplied.r practice problems are suggested (physics is always about going on to the next problem).

Just witness his treatment of Fraulein Burstner, His cousin, Leni, or the men who have come to see him on a business appointment.  Not a shred of human warmth eminates from his soul and as a result his own lack of humanity is on trial by the universe.   <br /> <br />His arrogance is wonderfully commented upon when he tries to make his public defense in the attic (his head?) during the first Sunday of his hearings and the entire gathered courtroom merely greets it with laughter.  He lacks humilty & compasssion and is thus less than human, a cardboard cut-out of a man. And that is his trial, to come to terms with this and change.   <br /> <br />He fails and in the end dies like a dog while in a distant window a light glimmers and a human being stretches his arms out to K., but it is too late for him. <br /> <br />The Trial needs to be read as the objectification of inner states, not as a literal story--(DUH!)	2005-10-12

My favorite story is when Buffy is under Mrs. Belakane's, who is an ant queen or can be in human form, control and she is someone who likes to fight and she would do anything for Mrs. Belakane. So your kind of like a dark Slayer. The other part is when all of your friends are under her control besides you and Willow. Also Xander gets very fat. There is another big bad in this book.

Do I agree with some of the reviewers who say that Straken and indeed much of this latest series isn't as original as it used to be?  Yeah, I would say that.  However, with that aside, Terry Brooks HAS managed to inject as much originality into a series that has been ongoing since 1977 as is possible.  As usual, I still find myself as eager now for his next novel as I was in High School waiting for The Wishsong to come out.  I am as many are, looking forward to a break from Shannara to see what else is bouncing around in his ingeniously creative mind.  I have hear LOTS of rumors, but after interviewing him for myself, I think that I will keep some of it quiet to allow the surprise to be that much bigger and enjoyable.<br /><br />Back to the book, though.  Straken has a wonderful finality to it which was lacking with the end of Morgawr a few years back.  The whole idea of being trapped INSIDE the Forbidding is easily one of, if not THE most creative aspect of almost all the Shannara stories since perhaps when Brooks introduced us to it originally back with Elfstones.  Knowing what to do and then being ABLE to pull it off are never quite the same with any novel set in the world of Shannara.  As is also the case with Straken.  Pen Ohmsford in his attempts to help rescue his aunt, the former Ilse Witch, banned to the Forbidding by the use of dark magic runs into many, MANY roadblocks along the way...the least of which includes evil menions of the false Ard Rhys trying to capture and kill him...watching friends die...and finding love.  Once Pen secures what he needs in order to help his aunt, he runs into you guessed it: even more problems.  That's okay.  Never fear, the outcome is never really in doubt.  The journey to find the resolution to this particular problem isn't just fun, but for me, it seemed more loaded with action and fantasy-charged testosterone than I have read from Brooks in a long time.  We get to see what a SEAL team would be like Shannara-style, and it was a real high point in the entire series.  You can definitely see additional depth to the writing skills of Mr. Brooks and fantastic character development as he continues his love of penning great stories.<br /><br />One last thought: I am a life-long fan of Terry Brooks.  He has earned my loyalty by writing great stuff again and again.  Moreover, after meeting him personally, he is easily the most down-to-earth kind and thoughtful author I have ever met.  At a book signing, it doesn't matter HOW many people are in line behind you, he treats each person as though they are the ONLY person there and doesn't put a limit to how many questions you can ask...even if it means he'll be there into the wee hours.  He certainly hasn't forgotten where he came from and WHY he is successful in the first place: his READERS.  You can say what you want about the guy, but I will ALWAYS be first in line to buy his books just as long as he continues to write them.  He always makes me feel as though my money was well spent...and when it comes down to it, isn't that all that matters?it was a real high point in the entire series.

This is to say, a massive whitewash is underway to convince Americans that she wouldn't absolutely destroy their lives. Obviously, this effort will persuade quite a number of people; to put it charitably, it's been quite a while since the average American could be described as a critical thinker. <br /> <br />So, this book is the first salvo in what will almost certainly emerge as the most significant political campaign in modern American history. It's a masterful piece of propaganda, and reads well - as one might expect from a writer as talented as Ms. Estrich. But it is propaganda nonetheless. If you are (1) open-minded, and (2) motivated to some degree by gender, then please consider the rational alternative - Condoleeza Rice (honestly, the open-minded part is sufficient...).	2005-10-12

I am staggered to the well-worn seat of my fine British trousers that you most fortunate Americans get to learn this stuff in grade school while we're assaulted by the history of trade unionism and Jarrow. God's Good Grief!, is American History not the most fantastic story since Cato tangled with Gaius. This is a well told story from my 2nd favourite American Ron; and if 700 pages spooks some of you, you best  stick with 'Hop on Pop'.<br /><br />I, for one, broke dates with cheerleaders & a Starbucks' coffee grinder girl to spend my evenings with Chernow's Hamilton, and when the end came too quickly I was ready to dive straight into James Madison. Understand that the chief merit of this book seems to get the greatest grief . . the economics. But as any flat-headed social-climbing Keynesian should know,  Cher now is an economic writer; and, ooh wee, can this Ronnie write.<br /><br />Up from under the stentorian din of Saint Patty's shillelagh shakers we're reminded more than once that those dear Scots had a little something to do with building up the foundations of this American experiment. And in the ill-judged execution of the well-judged plan of triumph, the call seldom produces a comer, and the man to build rarely coincides with the hour of creation. We are all of us who live indoors with full tummies and cablevision in debt to this Nevis-born belletrist.<br /><br />To: Ron Chernow<br /><br />(from pg. 724) \\"Eliza's fierce, unending loyalty to Hamilton certifies that their marriage had been deeply rewarding, albeit marred by Maria Reynolds and other misadventures.\\"<br /><br />If you had been a contemporary of Mr. John Church Hamilton, I fear that another armed tangle would have ensued from your suggestively indiscreet use of language.

He started out his professional novel publishing career with a Spider-Man novel and he returns to it here with this novel. The storyline follows some of the current comic book continuity with Peter teaching high school science, Mary Jane pursuing an acting career and Aunt May knowing Peter Parker equals Spider-Man. A new gamma-radiation treated version of ectasy is on the market and its killing people left and right--after they \\"Hulk-out\\" and Peter realizes that in order to stop the deaths, he'll have to find the source of the drug and put it out of business. DeCandido's great strenght in writing novels set in universes not of his own creation is that he's able to capture the voice and nuances of each character and that strength is on display here. But within that context, DeCandido is able to put his own stamp and interpretation on the characters and, for the most part, that works really well. Make not mistake--this novel is not going to win any awards for best fictional novel published this year, but it's a fun, fast-paced and enjoyable read that any fan of Spider-Man should enjoy.	2005-10-12

The simple fact of the matter is that Jordan has done something truly amazing.  He has craft what might be labeled a realistic fantasy series.  Instead of the fast paced adventure yarn that so many books in this genre become, Jordan has created a rich world filled with endless complexity.  In this world, things cannot be resolved with a simple wave of a hand.  Everything is soaked in politics and every move involves careful planning and thought (even then things don't always go the way they were planned).  This is the way wars really happen.

As stated in the introduction, the target audience for this book are software developers and IT staff who are interested or involved in developing for the burgeoning handheld market. The authors claim that to \\"provide enough information in each chapter to allow all technically savvy readers to follow along and understand the concepts.\\" They succeed admirably. To avoid a false sense of security in some readers, it might have been a good idea to provide a \\"what you should know before reading this chapter\\", but the reader has been fairly warned. <br /> <br />The book is divided into two parts, consisting of a total of 14 chapters and 6 appendices. Each chapter covers a separate aspect of the BlackBerry development and support environment. The first 5 chapters briefly but clearly cover the BlackBerry system architecture, installation, deployment and upgrade procedures. While these chapters are necessarily short and are obviously meant as supplements to the product documentation, the reader is left with the feeling that he has had a peek behind the scenes and has been given many valuable tips towards anticipating, resolving or avoiding potentially troublesome areas. <br /> <br />Chapters 6 through 8 comprise the remainder of Part I and cover monitoring, managing and in general enhancing the user experience. Chapter 7 covers much of the less obvious material needed to consistently set up new corporate users. Chapter 8 in particular covers disaster-recovery planning, an often overlooked activity. The advice in this section is simple and direct, but assumes that the reader is already very familiar with their Lotus Domino or Windows BES (BlackBerry Enterprise Server) environment. <br /> <br />Part II is aimed squarely at developers, and the area where the book really delivers. While much of the material in the rest of the book could presumably be obtained from RIM tech support or as part of proprietary training courses, this section dispels any sense of mystery regarding developing for this platform by providing variations of a sample (and very typical) custom application. These chapters give a good overview of MDS (Mobile Data Services), Web portals, and the BlackBerry Channel. Developers are walked through examples of using the handheld simulators, developing BlackBerry push channel and Java J2ME applications, managing cache content and of using the Plazmic Media Engine (PME) and the PME Content Developer's Kit (CDK). <br /> <br />The Plazmic Media Engine uses vector graphics rather than bitmaps for images and animation to reduce memory requirements and produce better quality graphics than one would otherwise expect on small-screen devices. In addition, the PME can be used to create audio content for a rich Web user experience. <br /> <br />This introduction to the PME covers all of the relevant content design considerations, such as dealing with the varying screen sizes, color depth, fonts, etc. The content created with Plazmic and deployed with the Composer or SVG Transcoding Utility (used to produce compressed distribution binaries) can be used across multiple mobile platforms. The sample code is available for downloading from the publisher. <br /> <br />The first 2 of 6 appendices provide a WML (Wireless Markup Language) and WMLScript reference. The remaining 4 are worth the price of the book to developers, as the development guides and coding tips (reprints from the in-house RIM BlackBerry Developer Journal) provide valuable help in avoiding the pitfalls of developing for the handheld environment. Combined with the sample code noted above, these provide an excellent quick-start guide to developing BlackBerry applications.	2005-10-12

I firmly believe this. I won't discuss the plot - you just have to read it yourself. All I can say is do buy the book and read it, no matter what your age.

So here's the deal: The Quitter is easily one of the most solid graphic novels I've read, bar none. <br /> <br />     Harvey Pekar, famous for his American Splendor comics, as well as the film about him that shares the same name, is not the everyman that most articles predictably and laboriously paint him as. How do you refer to somebody who's been writing jazz reviews for forty years as an everyman? Or how about a guy who doesn't get to be on Letterman anymore, since he turned the tables on the open mockery of him one too many times? <br />      <br />     I've read most of American Splendor, and I've enjoyed it, but it's rarely knocked me out. Don't get me wrong, it's some impressive stuff-the impression varying greatly with each artist who illustrates Pekar's work-but it's never been the sort of thing that I'd go out of my way to pick up regularly. The slice-of-life dialogue can really be killer, but it always felt a bit disjointed to me. <br />      <br />     Man, Quitter kicks the crap out of that little stereotype I've been nursing. The usual 90/10 dialogue/narration formula is flipped over as Pekar writes about his amazingly interesting early life, from the heady days of his being the best street fighter in his neighborhood, to his occasionally debilitating bouts of inadequacy and paranoia, to his countless jobs and week in the Navy. This is no longer \\"slice of life,\\" this IS life, and an incredibly interesting one at that. <br /> <br />     This is the kind of autobiographical stuff I can totally dig on; this is a guy going through and telling us his highs, his lows, and all with a detachment that's not totally unemotional. When I finished, I felt like I had a way better grasp on Harvey Pekar, and a far more vast respect for him and his life. <br /> <br />     I feel bad enough that I've gone this far without mentioning that this is-near as I can tell-the best art I've ever seen out of Dean Haspiel, and that's saying a lot. Easily the most impressive to me about this is that each panel isn't just the usual \\"snapshot\\" art. Instead, each one threatens to keep moving if you take your eyes off of it. We're talking Jack-Kirby's-Captain-America-is-striding-towards-the-Red-Skull-and-somebody's-gonna-lose-an-eye kinda power here. His framing of movement is incredible, with some amazing three-panel-spreads that tug your eyes along with the text, the character, and the flow of the story. <br /> <br />     Haspiel pulls nice camera angles without making them feel forced, and keeps the background as alive as the main character. One panel I really loved is where we see a young Pekar in class, watching the teacher, and a girl to the side looking away, but not at Pekar. It's like she's sneaking a glimpse at some off-panel crush, and Haspiel's letting us in on her secret. <br /> <br />     And the fights. A lot of this book comes down to fighting, where Pekar excelled, and was finally able to feel that he had accomplished something. His narrations of the schoolings are full of awesome, and Dino's art...man, some of those punches made my jaw ache. <br /> <br />     Listen to me, rambling away like a fanboy, or worse, an actual critic. Ignore my noise, and just get out there and buy The Quitter. <br /> <br />     As for me, I think I'm gonna read it again.	2005-10-12

The only thing to which I can attribute its popularity is its Afghan setting, because everything else about it I've seen before--in a hundred other hackneyed, contrived, badly written pieces of fiction.  Hosseini's prose could not be more trite and cliche-ridden.  (I found it humorous that his narrator occasionally points out cliches, apparently not aware of the hundreds of others that comprise the book, starting from the first sentence.  Too bad he wasn't being ironic.  But this author, I fear, knows nothing of the delicacies of irony.)  The plot is predictable, its rendering of redemption bordering on the absurd.  And the protagonist is a narcissistic chump, a truly repellent human being who renders up his prurient little tale with nary a glimmer of self-awareness.   <br /> <br />This novel would have been much better if: a) someone with an ounce of subtlety had written it; b) its attempts at foreshadowing, imagery, symbolism, and the like were aimed slightly above a sixth-grade reading level; c) it gave its above-sixth-grade reader a modicum of credit [yes, we get that Amir now has his own harelip--please, please don't spell it out-- you had to spell it out, didn't you? couldn't resist?]; and d) either the novel's plot underwent a radical overhaul in favor of the realistic or embraced its absurdity and called itself what it really is: a farce. <br /> <br />If this is what passes for great fiction these days, American readers are a very sad lot.	2005-10-12

I believe that this story would, indeed,  make a great movie or even a television series. While reading it, I've often envisioned Misty Row as a Dallas-like television series. It has so many twists and turns.  I don't want to ruin the plot or suspense for new readers, so I won't go into plot points in this review. However, to be sure, they are juicy, surprising and downright heart-stopping. If you love suspense, a good mystery, thrown in alongside some good sex scenes and some good, old-fashioned, over-the-top black characters ... then this book is for you. I'm so glad that I was able to come upon such a fabulous story. I, for one, could not stop reading until I got to the very end. Never have I been so addicted to a story in all of my life. Misty Row truly kept me spell bound.  B.K. is a genius.  Just a great writer and artist, who kept me very captivated in the complex and emotionally gripping  story line. I love his  writing style, his  vocabulary is stellar, his wit refreshing. I give him mad props and I love the gift he holds  as a gifted writer. I sat on the edge of my seat every day, just  waiting to get to the next chapter.  The cliffhangers always intrigued me. This is the work of a beautifully gifted writer and a man with a great mind. And, beyond all of that, I need to applaud B.K. Shropshire for giving us a \\"black\\" soap opera (with sexiness, alternate lifestyles,  intelligence, mystery and realness)  because we certainly don't have many on television, in movies, or even in novel-form. There's a large contingency of people who love the soapy, serial format - especially with the gay themes - and with Misty Row - those elements are created and woven in sheer excellence.  Thank you, B.K.,  for giving me and, so many others (I'm sure),  a wonderfully written novel.   Congratulations on writing such a remarkable story.  I look forward to reading more about Misty Row in the future. Thank God there will be asequel. LOL...now when will it be coming out? That is the REAL question!	2005-10-12

Indeed, his entire preface is a plea to take him seriously even though he's writing for the popular market because his contemporary scholars would reject his work.   <br /> <br />He gets a lot of stuff wrong.  For example, he has a photo of Ahkenaten sitting on his throne with the hands of the solar disk Aten holding anks to him and this is labelled as being an image of the Aten.  The figure is most certainly not the deity, but the pharaoh.  He spends pages on animal worship and completely ignores the Apis bull.  He makes connections where there are none (between Osiris's coffin being caught in a tree and a type of vegetation worship for which we have no evidence).  If you want to know about Egyptian mythology, look elsewhere.	2005-10-12

Hart's book is profound, sorely needed, and right on. She argues that idolizing children and focusing solely on their self-esteem is not healthy. Clearly they need nurturing, but not to the exclusion of limits, ground rules, and a solid understanding of right and wrong. Parents need to be authority figures. They also, she argues, need to stop obsessing about perfect kids and realize that mistakes can become learning opportunities that help children grow into healthy, well centered adults. And, of course, she argues against falling for the latest 60-seconding parenting tip of the day. Her work helps shift the focus back to parent's proper roles and responsibilities in guiding the character of their children. I taught in a public school part-time for eight years and currently teach martial arts to kids (and adults). I have seen the behavioral problems she refers to over and over again and have seen first hand how her approach really does work. And I use a similar approach with my own kids. This book is well written, compelling, and sorely needed. It's about time someone promulgated this approach. Highly recommended!	2005-10-12

It is a gripping read.  Paul Stiles' analysis of The Market is so penetrating, incisive, devastating, and powerful there can be no comeback to it.  He tore away the veils for me.<br /><br />  I also enjoyed his book because it is so carefully written.  His sentences are well-crafted, You know you are reading a work of art as well as book on economics and social science.<br /><br />  To get specific for a moment, even though the passage was short, there is passage in the book about what happens to the turkey on Thanksgiving, and it's just great.  The laissez-faire people DO only look at the production-side and overlook the integrity, the courage and honesty, and the compassion for others that's also involved and perhaps quite taken for granted.<br /><br />  I wish Paul Stiles had more punch as a philosopher, however, when he writes of the interior world or spirituality.  His arguments are philosophically weak and naive, especially in the context of \\"moral absolutes,\\" where he writes about the Ten Commandments.  The last third of the book is just pure religious mush. He gives short shrift to atheists, equating them only with materialists,  and he fails utterly even to mention the ancient Greeks who had much to contribute to the development of the Founding Fathers' ideas for the United States.<br /><br />  Still, his analysis of the Market is a genuine tour de force, and it is worth the price of the book.	2005-10-12

In \\"Notes from a Small Island,\\" he captures the experience of Great Britain, his own unique journey through it, and his own personality equally well.  He doesn't infuse the book with so much of himself that it becomes annoying, but just enough to give it character and an honest-to-goodness perspective.<br /><br />Bryson writes with a sharp wit that is seldom absent, and it's hard to read this book without wanting to laugh out loud and annoy those around you by reading short passages of it to them.  He points out some of the absurdities of Great Britain and its people, but is equally unafraid to turn that razor wit against himself and point out that he is no less absurd at times.  It's Bryson's sense of humour that makes this book so eminenetly entertaining, the sort of wit that most writers wish they could attain.<br /><br />Even so, Bryson has his serious moments too, and he uses them to showcase the Britain he knows and loves in all its understated glory. He's got an admirable eye for detail and an obvious love for the history of the British Isles, and these things exude from every chapter of the book.  In his travels across the United Kingdom, Bryson seems to prefer the small places, the places nobody goes much or talks about, places like Weston-super-Mare and Durham and John o'Groats and Bournemouth, and he gives we the readers a delightful look into some of the nooks and crannies in each of these places.  To be sure, he visits some of the big cities as well, like Edinburgh, Glasgow, and London of course...but his affections clearly lie in the out-of-the-way places, the ones that maintain a sense of their history and their character.<br /><br />It seems to me that \\"Notes from a Small Island\\" is an ideal book for both those who have lived in Great Britain and those who have never even been there.  For the former, Bryson provides a unique perspective and a clear love for the country, which any resident should be able to appreciate.  For the latter, his salient and funny points will help steer you in surprising directions, one which your average tour book wouldn't be able to recommend.<br /><br />I myself purchased \\"Notes from a Small Island\\" while in London, on a two-week holiday in Great Britain with my family.  I waited a while after I got back to read it, and when I finally did pick it up I found that it made me yearn to go back even more than I already was.  Bryson's descriptions of the land and the people, all the idiosyncracies that makes Great Britain what it is, and his sense of humour throughout the book, made me miss that place mightily.<br /><br />It makes me want to go back and see it all again...but this time, like he did.he former, Bryson provides a unique perspective and a clear love for the country, which any resident should be able to appreciate.

The main problem is that much of this history is a mixture of hearsay, misdirection, and out and out lies told by men who liked a good story better than reality. In order to make some sense of the whole thing an author would need some incredible resources. Jones tries to work around this limitation by focusing most of his energy around the creation of Superman by two fairly naive young men out of Cleveland, Ohio. The problem here is still the same; the men involved were not the greatest sources when alive and most of the information comes through hearsay and retellings of stories that seem a bit too pat. For the uninitiated, there are some interesting insights and history to be found here, but for those familiar with the industry, most of the stories will be very familiar.  <br /> <br />When Jones strays from his central concern of Siegel and Shuster's struggles the book actually becomes a more enjoyable read. Jack Kirby and his anger fueled imagination, Steve Ditko's intensity, and other visionaries of the times make fleeting appearances and I often found myself wishing that Jones had decided to investigate any of these other individuals' lives and contributions to the industry. This could serve as a readable and enjoyable entry to understanding where the industry came from, but I really think the truth will never really be uncovered; unlike many historical figures, these men didn't have any idea what they were doing would be examined for posterity. They were just making comics. Bless their hearts. <br />	2005-10-12

Mix Cellini is a former abused child with the attendant potential for violence.  He is obsessed with mass murderer Reggie Christie (who really did live in Notting Hill) and with supermodel Nerissa Nash.  Nerissa has her own fantasies about the boy next door.  Gwendolyn Chawcer, an octogenarian who rents a flat to Mix Cellini, constantly remembers her own great love, a doctor who attended her dying mother fifty years earlier.  The plot interweaves between these characters and their obsessions, finally culminating in a tragic but satisfying ending for two characters and greater maturity and self-knowledge for the third.<br /><br />The settings add to the pleasure of the plot twists.  London's Notting Hill is a crowded, cosmopolitan area with many neighborhoods ranging from posh to slum, and Gwendolyn Chawcer's crumbling, dust-filled mansion is an appropriately creepy, even haunted, center for the mystery's unfolding. There are also many lesser characters whose personalities and observations add to the story and help illuminate the main plot.<br /><br />Thirteen Steps Down is Rendell at her finest.	2005-10-12

I agree with those in the majority who have reviewed this book.  It was a terribly boring story and hard to follow at times.  I am a huge Minette Walters fan.  In my opinion, she's right up there with Ruth Rendell.  She normally writes very captivating stories with a true storyteller's touch but this veered off in quite a different direction than anything else I have read by her.  The word by word e-mails from one character to another were dreadful.  I found myself skimming over them.  It appeared to me that they were put there to take up page space because they certainly were not there to enrich the story or provide anything of interest.  There wasn't even really a mystery here.  It was obvious what was going on right away.  I did not care for this book one bit.

Sadly this book left a lot to be desired. <br /> <br />Mr.Houston the author starts the book out in Lawton, Oklahoma where Billie Cassin aka Lucille Leseur aka Joan Crawford was raised as a young child.  There are few new details added to what most other biographers have written, the stepfather was owner of a local theater and Billie was exposed to show biz through him.  <br /> <br /> The thing I disliked most about this book was the author writing conversations between Joan and whomever she was speaking with as if he were there eavesdropping.  That is just moronic. <br /> <br />The same old stories of Joan being abused as a child while attending St. Agnes and Rockingham Academy are drummed out with a few local folks being quoted as her being pretty much of a slut and ner do well.  It's the same old story. I did enjoy seeing the few photo's in the book, some were very rare and I had never seen them before.  The book however, did reinforce the face that Billie Cassin aka Joan Crawford did come from very humble beginnings and by sheer force of will and determination made it to the heights of movie stardom.	2005-10-12

Based on the \\"Editor's review\\", I quickly decided to give the book a try, and ordered it. <br /> <br />I would greatly recommend this book to anyone working with small groups in a christian setting. It can in fact be very helpful for those who work with small groups in any setting, as much of the book is devoted to the processes that take form in a group of 5 to 12 people. <br /> <br />But first and foremost the book is about what makes a christian community unique, and how to stimulate this deep community in a small group. Especially, a clear distinction is pointed out between real community, where members love and know each other, and pseudo-community, where members appear polite and careful, but without showing real care for each other.  <br /> <br />The author shows great insight into the reactions and different stages that take place in a small group, and uses this knowledge to explain what steps might be wise to do as a leader of such a group. As an extra bonus in addition to the excellent text, each chapter is followed by a section of \\"Firestarters\\" which can be used as is in your existing small group. These \\"Firestarters\\" are helpful games, questions or case studies that helps the group members open up towards each other. These sections are nearly worth the price themselves.	2005-10-12

Robert Graham, a millionaire, had an idea to protect the human race from genius extinction. He'd open the \\"Repository for Germinal Choice\\", a sperm bank that would find it's donors among Nobel Prize winners. Women would line up in droves to get some super sperm and begin to produce future scientists, inventors and future leaders of America. The book weaves three sections: the history of Graham and the practice of artificial insemination, the donors, and finally the children that resulted.<br /><br />Plotz manages to inject enough humor in the investigative reporting that the book moves along at quite a clip, feeling like a cross between a B science fiction movie, and a missing persons thriller. Ultimately it's the human element of the parents and children that anchors the story, and gives the overall book it's melancholic heart.	2005-10-12

BIO -->from wikipedia.org -->Avram Noam Chomsky, Ph.D (born December 7, 1928) is the Institute Professor Emeritus of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Chomsky is credited with the creation of the theory of generative grammar, often considered the most significant contribution to the field of theoretical linguistics of the 20th century. He also helped spark the cognitive revolution in psychology through his review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior, which challenged the behaviorist approach to the study of mind and language dominant in the 1950s. His naturalistic approach to the study of language has also impacted the philosophy of language and mind (see Harman, Fodor). He is also credited with the establishment of the so-called Chomsky hierarchy, a classification of formal languages in terms of their generative power. Chomsky is also widely known for his political activism, and for his criticism of the foreign policy of the United States and other governments. Chomsky describes himself as a libertarian socialist, a sympathizer of anarcho-syndicalism.	2005-10-12

I always thought that for a group of books to be called a SERIES there had to be 3 or more.  Since the last book in this group (of 2) came out in 2001 I suppose that this `series' is dead?  A few loose ends were left open at the end of Aurora, is there going to be another book or are you just going to leave us HANGING!?  (...)  I guess that the publisher felt that there was not enough interest in this series, to continue to request more books be written.  So, I guess that this series is DEAD, no forthcoming books have been contracted.  Stupid publisher that has 'NO CLUE' what the readers want to read.  Skewed ratings resulted, I guess too many \\"Romance novel readers\\" diddn't like the Psychic Warrior series.    Looks like the same thing that happened to Harry Turtledove's \\"Colonization\\" series, that ended abruptly almost mid-story, after he spent 3 books setting up the rest of the series!	2005-10-12

The author borrowed the story line of Shakespeare's Tempest and added years, events, and characters in and around the play.  The author also borrows some of the ways Shakespeare developed his characters.  A \\"witch\\" is presented as not evil.  A \\"monster\\" in the eyes of some is revealed as a sympathetic character.  Most important is Ariel, a spirit of imagination, who leads people to trouble to the extent that they opt for a world of imagination instead of the world as it is.  While the book may be accessible to young adults, its sophisticated treatment of characters gives it layers of meaning best appreciated by those long gone from high school.  Its ending, which I will not spoil by revealing, is stunning, and provides much food for thought for anyone concerned with America's history and direction.  One warning: those who prefer their spirits to be cuddly Tinkerbell's over spirits capable of malevolence, and those who prefer Disney-sanitized fairy tales over the original Brothers Grimm, might find this book unsettling.	2005-10-12

It's an example of that rare beast: plot-driven literary fiction (gasp)!  <br /> <br />If you're looking for character-driven fiction with emotions, this is definitely not your book. It's not cathartic, it's not about feelings, and it's not sentimental. It is, however, a wolf in sheep's guise.  <br /> <br />It's an amazingly fast-paced read, with several parallel storylines that keep you guessing until the final act and then converge and climax nicely without being too ham-fisted or deus ex machina. So in a word, it's a thriller.  <br /> <br />But it's also a sneaky little novel that will stick in your brain. The writer has created an entirely new world, where hidden systems and groups pull the strings behind the scenes of our lives. It's Orwellian with a sense of humor-and not an ironic, satirical sense of humor. The humor is dark, but not pretentious. The writer keeps it moving and keeps it simple. He doesn't use words to show off, he uses words to communicate. He uses words with precision and agility, forcing them to work overtime. <br /> <br />While I was reading NOTES FROM UNDERWHELMED, I was struck by how fast the pages were turning. There is an economy of language that cuts to the heart of every scene, making each sentence (and every thought) mean something. There are no wasted scenes, and the writing acts as a propulsive force-as rocket fuel that powers this book to its final destination.  <br /> <br />But then, when the dust clears and you put it down, that's when the real trick happens. Here you thought you finished a rather interesting, minimalist thriller that made you ponder certain aspects of the fractured persona of man circa now, but you'll find your mind coming back to the characters (especially the mysterious Mr. Caution), settings and scenes. You'll arrive at a different place. Because NOTES FROM UNDERWHELMED sneaks in very high-concept social commentary between the action and cliffhangers. <br/> <br />Again, if you're looking for emotional catharsis and insight, avert your eyes. But if you want a thriller that entertains in the deepest way and quietly nestles itself into your mind and forces you to keep thinking and examining it long after you finish it, then NOTES FROM UNDERWHELMED is an ace in the hole.	2005-10-12

All of us have different tastes & thoughts, though, so it is up to each reader to decide if they wish to try a new title.<br /><br />I don't like to give away storyline because I think that detracts from the reader's enjoyment, so I will say what I can:  the book starts out with what I thought was a very intriguing premise, leaves suspicion in one of the hero/heroine's minds toward the other one's innocence, and of course there is the question of whether or not the heroine ends up preggers or not.  The cover is misleading, because we don't find out until near the end if she is or isn't, so don't let the cover turn you away.<br /><br />I plan to read this one again, and I don't re-read many books.<br /><br />-Cyndi	2005-10-12

If you do you'll feel compelled to read all 6 books and the last book in this series is a steaming pile of dung. <br /> <br />See my review of the 6th book to see my specific complaints. But, a quick summary is: Nothing happens. <br /> <br />Numerous plot lines are opened up over the course of these 6 books, but absolutely none of them result in anything really changing. Two revolutions are started and then quashed. The god promises a big change and then does not change in any significant way. Characters are created and then killed off. Grand secret plots are plotted, executed, and then fail. An overthrow of the leadership almost happens, but then it doesn't.	2005-10-12

Following a trip back east and visiting Fredricksburg, Chancellorville, Wilderness, and Manassas battlefields, I have recently discovered this facinating time in our history, which I had shamefully ignored.   I would  like to thank all of you civil war buffs who have spent years studying the civil war who have pointed me to some of the really good books through your own reviews.  They are very helpful.   I made it through McPhearson's great book Battle Cry of Freedom, and Pratt's Ordeal by Fire, and listen to the Killer Angels on CD on my  way to work.   I am far from an expert on the war, however there are a couple of mistakes in this book of lists that are troubling to me.  I don't know all of the dates and statistics, but on page 72 the Battle Deaths from 10 American Conflicts has the civil war casualties as 214,938. (???)  According to McPhearson, the soldier casualties were over 600,000, with more Americans dying in this war than all of the other wars combined.  On page 73,  The Largest Battles of the War, has Gettysburg as being fought from July 1-3, 1864.  1864!!!  Even I know that is wrong and that the proof reader was overpaid! <br />Anyway, what is disturbing to a novice like myself, is the question of how many other statistics in this book  are wrong that, not being a scholar, I wouldn't be aware of?  I find myself not trusting the book because of these two obvious errors.  Otherwise, I think the premise of the book is good in terms of a reference, and give it two stars because of that.  However,  other readers of this book who are more knowledgable about civil war stats, may want to pay particular attention to the accuracy of the book.	2005-10-12

If you like Ohio history or even American history ~~ this book is definitely for you! It starts back in the beginning with Anthony Wayne's fight against the British and the Indians and end with Charles Dicken's visit to Ohio. All these little stories ~~ beautifully written and easy to read ~~ makes you long for more stories. These stories remind me of sitting at my dad's knee and listening to the stories of days yonder.

The Siegels show that the extraodinary City revival of the '90s was not just the result of NY happily riding the coattails of the booming national economy, but rather of a series of tenaciously hard-fought victories over long entrenched interests that had been choking city life. Rather than going along with practices that had been long accepted, like corruption and mob influence at the Javit Center and Fulton Fish Market, Rudy took on the thugs and broke their stranglehold -- to cite two of his more modest, but nonetheless courageous triumphs over the rot that he inherited. Particularly helpful is the account of Rudy refusing time after time to succumb to the racial polarizing of Sharpton, Rangel, and other self-appointed Harlem leaders who consistently fought to retain the failed policies on welfare, schools, public order, social spending, etc. that so depressed NY life pre-Rudy.<br /><br />Rudy's genius at leadership radiates on the pages of this book.<br /><br />The last chapter on Bloomberg's tilt toward the old order and his far more muddled leadership style provides a terrific summary of the last four years.	2005-10-12

Ms McCullough has done a profound historical research in order to write her \\"Roman Saga\\" started with \\"The First Man in Rome\\" in 1990 and continues with \\"The Grass Crown\\" (1991). There are four installments more.    She delivers an accurate picture of the late Roman Republic, bringing to life historically characters with amazing detail.  The author follows and reveals step by step all the intricacies of that rich and complex era.    Does this mean that the book is boring? By no means, Ms McCullough is able to show daily life, dressing, feeding, religious rituals, political and social structures in a magnificent fresco and at the same time construct an engaging story that will trap the reader for hours.    The story starts in the year 99 BC, following the careers of Marius and Sulla as they step by step draw away from each other and start a bitter confrontation.   The backdrop is the \\"Social War\\" (uprising of the Italics against Rome), the invasion of Greece and Rome's Asian province by King Mithridates and the harsh clash of plebeian and patrician.    Ms McCullough gives also numerous anecdotes about different great Romans as Marcus Livius and his sister Livia Drusa; Marcus Aemilus Scaurus and his very young wife Dalmatica. Their stories crisscross the entire novel.  Almost inadvertently Gaius Julius Caesar is introduced in the story giving his first steps as a boy and a pre-teenager of outstanding intelligence and sensibility.    Last but not least the author has drawn beautiful busts of the main characters; detailed maps of different ancient scenarios where action takes place and a very complete glossary.     I recommend reading the first volume of the series, but even if you don't do it, you will no be at loss as the author gives some flashbacks in the first pages.  I strongly recommend this book to any serious history aficionado!  Reviewed by Max Yofre.	2005-10-12

Very handy.  Thank you, Richard Barber!    ...  And more:  I have been a Grail hobbyist since the late 1970s, and I skipped reading Da Vinci Code because I had already read Baigent & Leigh and the subject had grown so *yawn* passe.  I've read shelves of Grail literature, and tossed aside countless books on the subject that turned out to be, well, ridiculous, or ravings, or poorly written either in terms of sloppy thinking or overmuch obfuscating.  Not that there aren't good books on the subject, just that the ratio of good to unhelpful is depressingly poor.  Barber's book is beyond helpful, it is straightforward, encyclopedic, and non-derogatory (and I totally didn't catch anything \\"cutesy\\", despite what another reviewer is grumping about).      It is of course helpful to have read a few Grail stories first!  I would recommend Malory's Morte D'Arthur (there is a lovely new edition out by Barnes & Noble if you want to treat yourself) and a nice version of Chretien de Troyes, but probably any would do, although I'd recommend a minimum of two, and from at least two separate languages or centuries (and Disney doesn't count).  It is also helpful to have a basic knowledge of the Christian Eucharist (Mass, Communion), wherein the Body and Blood of Christ are present in the Bread and Wine.  Less common but (I think) also interesting treatments also include the poetic cycles Taliessin Through Logres and The Region of the Summer Stars, by Charles Williams (AKA his Arthuriad) as well as the novels of Stephen R. Lawhead.  Grail works are typically eccentric, so one must find the works that best suit one.    One of the many very useful things that Barber pointed out, for me, was the interweaving of the various forms of Christ's Blood (blood from his body vs. \\"blood\\" of Communion wine), and which he does, in my opinion, objectively, leaving the reader to decide what he or she may or may not believe.  Barber just traces what was written by whom and when... along with just enough about settings and such, not too much, but with a novella's worth of bibliography, one can read on as one desires.      When it comes to the later works, however, Barber really hits his stride in terms of critical commentary.  He agrees or disagrees with various scholars and movements, and provides names and dates so that you may, again, follow up as you like.  He seems to have been particularly moved by Wagner's Parsifal.  As Barber moves into the modern works, his tone becomes more critical.  At first I found this a little disturbing, as I had enjoyed his neutral stance regarding the early scholarship, but then I thought that it was only right, because now he is evaluating and judging writers who are his peers, whose context in culture is known to him -- those of whom, it may be said, he has \\"walked a mile in their moccasins.\\"  While I very much enjoyed the Baigent & Leigh book (Holy Blood, Holy Grail), it is in a way the modern incarnation of Erich von Daniken's _Chariots of the Gods_, which I had enjoyed as a child, and I am more than comfortable with Barber's critical dismissal of it.  Also, and perhaps this is a significant point, I am in agreement with Barber's summation of the tradition as an intergrowth of \\"imagination and belief,\\" and in fact I think I have been of that mind for some years and just unable to distill it as he has.    I've been to a number of Grail-related locations, such as the Chalice Well in Glastonbury, and that little church, I forget where, with the lamprey carved in the wall over the piscina.  Garway, maybe?    This book introduces a few more places for my list of future Grail sites to visit.  All in all, an unprecedented work, and a much welcome sanity break in a typically subjective genre.    My review hardly does justice to this amazing work.  If you or someone you know is a Grail hobbyist, please at least have a look at this book.   For my part, I cannot wait to read his works on Chivalry and King Arthur, and if I am very lucky, I may someday have a chance to attend a convention and see his mind at work live at the podium.  (I feel this way also about Tom Shippey, as regards Tolkien and language scholarship.)	2005-10-12

As this review is titled, this is a 200 page book packed into 489 pages. The premise is interesting, but there the value ends. I agreed with most of the author's viewpoints, but found them poorly presented. The author has the  conceit to abandon conventional puctuation without the innovation in writing to warrant it. I suspect she is embarassed to have so little going on and so much dialog that she has chosen not to use quotation marks. The dialog is unconvincing. Character development is weak, and the characters are fairly flat. The attempts at humor are incredibly weak, for example, the bits about the landscaping at the self-indulgent woman's house are a bit sad, but not convincing enough to be humor or to be satisfactory commentary on modern life.  <br /> <br />There is a lot of extraneous verbage in this, to no value. The worst is the sophomoric pseudo-philosophy, which should have been left in the college dorm 3:00 AM B.S. sessions. A good thing to do at that age, but this doesn't belong in a novel. A few pithy observations would have been powerful. Instead, one feels stoned to death with popcorn. <br /> <br />This book might have be passable with a strong editor. There is a strong temptation to skim, but the stuff relating to the plot is buried in the junk. I suspect this is an attempt for a movie deal, as you can sense the treatments. Not recommended unless you are less than 21.	2005-10-12

The editing, however, is terrible.  The author can take the blame for the blatantly human metaphors that sometimes appear in the thoughts of the birds.  But the editor is probably the one who should be fired over the grammatical errors, misused words, horribly punctuated sentences (random useless commas everywhere), and, most scandalously, misspellings!

The back of the book claims it's recommended \\"Beginner to Advanced.\\" That's a bit of a stretch. This is probably a good book for someone new to the glories of Linux who wants to be told what and when to type. It also provides a decent overview of what specific applications are out there. This book answers questions like, \\"Are there any applications that'll let me hook up my digital camera?\\" If you're looking for a tome-like reference book that'll be there when you need to find out how to configure some obscure daemon or interpret cryptic dmesg output, then you should probably look elsewhere. (And if you find it elsewhere, let me know!) <br /> <br />The book comes with alot of linux distros on a DVD and CD, but most of these are several versions out of data at this point and you'll probably end up downloading newer ISO's and burning your own CD's anyway.

Stuckey has not had a winning season since McGrew was in school and Coach Mike Armstrong is determined this year will end that losing streak.  Most boys in Stuckey dream of basketball scholarships, playing for Kansas University, then heading off to the NBA like their hero, McGrew.  Kirby dreams of riding the bench with cool confidence, of injuries to keep him off the team, and of locating a father who disappeared before he was born.  He believes Brett McGrew is his father.  But will McGrew<br /><br />reject him?  Kirby knows too well that sometimes the thing you want the most in the world doesn't want you back.<br /><br />K.U. is retiring McGrew's jersey and invites the 7th grade team from Stuckey to participate.

Sam Kashner seems to want everything to be as it had been before his birth, but his timidity prevented him from acting out the 50's, 60's or the 70's.  He didn't \\"get his hands dirty\\" as Naropa student Peter Marti put it, a poet who crawled from some serious wreckage to a sanity beyond shooting drugs and a heterosexuality based on what he wanted, not what he feared.<br /><br />We'll skip the list of details Sam gets wrong (for example, Burroughs did not shoot an apple, but a shot glass, from his wife's head), but suffice it say there are enough of them to indicate he's not a scholar of the situation.  The fact that he is actually a professional journalist who writes for GQ and VANITY FAIR confirms my worst fears about articles in these magazines.  On the plus side, Sam's magazine background makes this as breezily readable as the best pop journalism.  First, however, we are forced to examine some of the remarks reserved for women.  Anne Waldman is glamorous and unavailable, thus a vain bitch.  Diane di Prima has become heavy, and thus disappoints.<br /><br />It is almost grim that Sam is in the middle of such interesting history and seems to be blowing it by insisting on his preconceptions.  I visited Naropa in 1978.  I'd known Allen for 4 years, and had already filmed Burroughs in NYC.  Corso was a scary guy I'd met in SF and regarded as a great poet but I was never in his court, though I saw him at least a dozen times over the years.  Naropa was an extension of what I already knew, and was for the brief week I stayed there, both a heaven and hell for me.  In memory, it is a legend I brushed against gratefully.	2005-10-12

It details the many mistakes made by both combatants and demonstrates the truth of the old adage that he who makes the fewest mistakes wins. One thing that shows through the entire book is the Japanese inability to work as a team or to make any realistic plans for war. Unlike the Allies the Japanese Army and Navy Air Forces did not work together at all well. This cost them dearly. The Japanese decieved themselves by their easy victories in China and before Guadacanal had really never faced anyone who could fight back.

This one takes place a couple of thousand years after Children of Dune left off. Everyone from that book is dead except Leto the second. He is the god emperor of the known universe. He is called god because the sandtrout skin is turning him into a worm. He is about half way done with the transformation. His only human features left are his arms, his legs reduced to unusable flippers, his face and, of course, a human mind, though it is getting worm instincts. The other major powers are the Bene Tleilaxu, Bene Gesserit, the Guild, and the Ixians. Leto controls all of the spice and distributes it as he sees fit. Everyone else wants to get their hands on as much spice as possible. Leto has been making gholas, which are like clones of dead people, of Duncan Idaho.  He has made thousands of them.  This novel is much like the other Dunes just farther in the future than the first three Dunes. It still has the \\"plots within plots within plots\\" thing going on. The plot is a bit confusing but it is very good. <br /> The book was very exciting because of all the plots going on at once. There wasn't a lot of actual fighting but it was still a great book. There was a lot of politics involved, which makes it a bit hard to follow sometimes but if you stick to it you understand it. I didn't feel like I was in the book. Instead I felt like I was someone watching everything going on. It was a very different style of writing than I am used to but it was still very good. It was hard, for me, to keep track of the main conflict because there were so many other conflicts and plots. It also switched between characters every couple of chapters. One chapter you're following Leto the next you're following the Bene Gesserit or a rebel or someone else. That sometimes got me confused but I got used to it. The main conflict was very interesting and made you want to keep reading. Thecharacters were very realistic. The author was very good at showing their emotions. He also would let you see their thoughts in the middle of a conversation, which was very cool and let you know the character better. The characters also had very distinct and unique personalities. The characters almost seemed like you could meet them on the street as real people. The book's ending was very exciting. There were several large twists, none of which I will ruin.  They made you want to keep reading to see what happened next. It left quite a few big questions unanswered but I hope they will answer them in the next Dune book.  <br /> The author speaks through whichever character he is using for that chapter. This allows you to get to know the characters' personalities and feelings better. This also gives you a chance to see into their thoughts. The author uses very descriptive words when describing emotions or a new character. In some cases I could almost visualize the character or thing. This helped me with the book and made the story much better. The author used a lot of dialogue which made the book more interesting. It was sometimes hard to follow the conversation but generally it was good and easy flowing conversation. The author was very detailed when telling you about anything new or how a character's face changed to show emotion. The over all tone of the book seems to be that Leto has to do this or make someone do this, to save humanity and stay on the golden path. Which is good but it gets a little annoying. I liked the style the author wrote in but sometimes the conversations were hard to follow. It was generally easy to follow but every once in awhile I got lost. <br />          I would give this book 9.5 out of 10 because it was a great story with a great plot but it was hard to follow sometimes and I was very confused when I started because this one takes place so much farther in the future than the other Dunes. It was a great book and I recommend it for any and all sci-fi readers and of course all Dune fans. It is amazing how the author created this new world out of the old Dune worlds. Dune fans will love this new Dune to the series because it still follows the same great Dune way.  <br /> This was a beautifully written book where Frank Herbert used his imagination beyond anyone else's. It is a marvelous sci-fi book and probably one of the best ever. Enjoy reading it!	2005-10-12

For that matter most of the supporting cast from \\"The Rocksburg Railroad Murders\\" are missing this time around, such as Father Mazzo, Balzic's mom, and his young girls. The most important familiar face in the novel turns out to be Mo Vulcanas, the inebriated Greek lawyer. But then \\"The Man Who Like to Look at Himself\\" is much more of a solo effort for the chief than the first novel.<br /><br />Balzic and Minyon are out hunting pheasant and the day goes from bad (Minyon's dog bites Balzic and the only thing he shoots is a starling with a broken wing) to worse when the dog uncovers a piece of human bone that shows clear markings of having been hacked apart. More bones pop up and the common denominator is that they are all found on farms when the Rocksburg Rod and Gun Club, although not enough to allow for an identification of the remains. And if Balzic does not have enough problems, Reverend Callum is complaining to the City Council about the racist policies of the local police. Minyon goes off on a series of wild tangents trying to break the case and see his name in the papers, while Balzic takes a more methodical (and more intelligent) approach. \\"The Man Who Liked to Look at Himself\\" is good old-fashioned detective work, when asking questions from various people eventually gets Balzic in the right place at the right time to ask the right question to the right person. Given what happened at the end of the first novel, you cannot help but approach the conclusion of this one with concern over what horrible final twist of fate might intrude upon the denouement.<br /><br />The mystery elements are much stronger in this second Balzic novel, but the chief attraction remains the main character, who continues to care about people as well as solving the crime. Constantine has created a character who is a good cop and a decent man. I read a description of Balzic from the \\"Washington Star\\" that described him as \\"unpretentious, unsentimentalized, uncaricatured,\\" which certainly hits the nail on the head all three times. In this novel the obstacles to Balzic's investigation are mostly offstage and it is more a question of Minyon catching up to what really happened before the Lieutenant makes another stupid mistake. This is not a mystery where you have to dodge red herring right and left, but one in which the hero works his way slowly and methodically to the truth.<br /><br />For the fourth Mario Balzic novel, \\"A Fix Like This,\\" Constantine has clearly settled on the simple approach of having the Chief engage people in conversation. Actually, a lot of people in a lot of conversations, very few of which are actual police interrogations. The impulse to have those in power try to get in Balzic's way as he hunts down the truth has been muted considerably.  All Balzic has to worry about this time are people who will not talk to him or tell him lies when they do.  Armand \\"Fat Manny\\" Manditti has been stabbed repeatedly and is brought into the emergency room by his brother Tullio the Tub. Only his obesity saved Fat Manny from joining the choir of angels, but he refuses to tell Balzic what happened. The chief is suspicious and convinced that Tullio is going to take care of this himself. The Mandittis both work for Dom Muscotti,Manny as a runner and gofer, while Tullio runs Muscotti's dump. Just to make things even worse on the other side of the law in Rocksburg, Dom has been seeing a younger woman on the side and Balzic fears the worst should Mrs. Muscotti learn about what is going on.<br /><br />Usually while Balzic is having his conversations around town he is trying to figure out who murdered the town's latest victim. But this time around he is trying to prevent at least one murder, probably more depending on whether he can get a break. What makes \\"A Fix Like This\\" the best of Constantine's mysteries to date (1975 in this case) is that clear thinking, good intentions, and quick action are not always enough to make things come out right. Fortunately Balzic has some people to talk to, not just when he is trying to find things out but also when he need to talk aloud to figure out how everything fits together.<br /><br />The main thing is that by the time you have read a couple of Constantine's mysteries that should be enough to get you committed to the entire Mario Balzic series.  I suppose it does not make too much of a difference what order you read some of these early books, although ideally you will do them in order.  But if you can get two mysteries this good between the covers of one volume that could be considered an agreeable tradeoff.  However, be forewarned that Constantine does not believe in chapters so if you settled into bed to read one chapter before going to sleep you are in for a long night.Muscotti, Manny as a runner and gofer, while Tullio runs Muscotti's dump.

A diehard liberal and a political fanatic, someone whose views would normally make me sneer and scoff, Stephanopolous paints a picture of the stresses, ins-and-outs, spin, activities and the vital scope of the world inside the Oval Office. Every newsworthy event or program is canvassed for its political ramafications; the very definition and refinement of the word \\"politics\\" is reinforced on every page; the mistakes that lead to triumphs, and the feel-good preparations that lead to disasters are all here in stark detail. Stephanopolous proves himself a very sensible man, and even his staunchly liberal views are sidenotes to the greater energies, arguments and preparations that occur inside the White House. I occasionally disliked S's speaking his own platform (which he did sparingly), or telling how political parties are constructed to blunt the other even when their plans are sensible, but all in all I learned more from this book about the workings inside the White House than from all my prior readings and public education.	2005-10-12

His main character Mitch Rapp is a no-nonsense CIA operative who does what it takes to combat terrorists and win the war on terror. Flynn combines action with domestic political conflict in a way that is never boring and never dry. I am not sure that someone with a Liberal viewpoint would agree with the way Rapp handles the fight against terrorism but in order to win the fight we have to be willing to unleash people like him.<br /><br />I had a hard time putting this book down and read it cover to cover in just two sittings (I was too tired to finish it in one). The action never stops and the best part about it is is that it's very believable (with one exception) and not made into a Hollywood action scene with foolish and impossible acts. While Flynn's other Rapp books have dealt with Rapp's personal relationships that was almost completely absent from this book (good or bad you decide).<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because the paperback version is printed in some strange size which is about 3/4\\" taller than a normal paperback. This means that I had to pay $2 more for it and it doesn't fit in with my other books. A publishing company ploy which soaks people for $2 more. I certainly hope this isn't a new trend....<br /><br />Hint: If you like Vince Flynn try Daniel Silva.	2005-10-12

This book is NOT a guide to alternative medicine by any means. Nor is it written by someone who even knows anything about alternative medicine.  <br /> <br />   The publisher is the first clue. Prometheus books has a website, go check it out. They have many books like this one. They publish many books that are skeptical in nature - without being objective, fair minded, or even informative. Some of them bother to sound scientific, while others, like this one, don't even pretend. <br /> <br />   This book is written with one focus, to discredit everything that is NOT conventional medicine. I do mean everything, even alternative treatments that have been proven again and again reliably by science. <br /> <br />   Of course the other blaring aspect of this book - there is not one mention of the huge problems inherent to conventional medicine. It talks about being taken by charlatans, about alternative \\"quackery.\\" But it never mentions the drug companies, perhaps the biggest and richest charlatans going. It never mentions the rate of iatrogenic death (deaths caused by medical treatment), now either the 3rd or 4th leading cause of death in the US. Don't believe it - look it up - those stats are readily available on the web. Obviously conventional medicine has made amazing and life saving advances. But is is in no way infallible.  <br />    <br />    This book is written by a true believer who is pointing the finger at what he doesn't like or believe in. There is no credibility, no \\"science.\\" It is just a cheap shot at trying to discredit every alternative medicine. A more truthful title would have been something like: \\"The consumer guide to quack medicine - in my opinion.\\" This is only a good read for people who already believe that conventional medicine is the \\"true\\" way to heal.	2005-10-12

So I thought it would only be fair to present a professional review for this book.     \\"Through various lineup changes and musical trends, and over 75 million in sales, the mighty Van Halen remain one of America's most inventive, exciting and revered rock powerhouses. A new book, Van Halen 101, provides an all-encompassing look at Pasadena, California's hard rock champions. Written by Abel Sanchez, the book, featuring a foreword by Queen guitarist Brian May, offers everything you wanted to know about VH and much much more. Tallying over 400 pages, the book chronicles the group's heady early days playing backyard parties in Pasadena and their long stint headlining Gazzarri's on Hollywood's famed Sunset Strip to their sensational self-titled debut to the group's most recent 2004 tour. Archival interviews with the band, producers, engineers, road crew and industry insiders help shape their compelling story.    \\"Along with an extensive overview of the group's four-decade career, the book also includes a slew of noted six-string luminaries attesting to the groundbreaking guitar work of Edward Van Halen, among them, Joe Walsh, B.B. King, Robby Krieger, Dave Navarro, Ted Nugent, Steve Vai, Steve Howe, James Hetfield, Joe Satriani, the late \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell Abbott, Steve Cropper, Allan Holdsworth, Zakk Wylde, Steve Lukather, John McLaughlin and more. Making this book even more indispensible for Van Halen's legion of worldwide supporters is the inclusion of a comprehensive look behind the recording of each Van Halen album, an in-depth peek behind the VH sound with special emphasis on Eddie's revolutionary playing including a look at the creation of 'Eruption,' his jaw-dropping display of six-string virtuosity, his extraordinary tapping technique, and his arsenal of guitars and gear. All told, Van Halen 101 is a terrific encapsulation of Van Halen's storied musical career, their vast impact on the music scene, and their unassailable legacy as purveyors of heavy metal genius.\\"    Now that, my friends, is a review. Along with this, Van Halen 101 received the stamp of approval from Guitar World magazine (the world's premier guitar magazine). On the back cover of the book there is a quote from an Editor of Guitar World which states, \\"I liked what I read a lot. This book is a labor of love and all true VH fans will love it.\\"    When you receive the stamp of approval from people like Guitar World and Ken Sharp, well, rest assured this is a kick arse book.	2005-10-12

Although Mr Thor has not quite maintained the high standards of his first book, this is not bad.  A previous reviewer is right that these novels are getting very close to those by Vince Flynn and his character Mitch Rapp and while entertaining, this did feel that it was treading a well worn path.<br /><br />Having said that, if you enjoyed the previous ones, you will probably enjoy this too.  It suffers from a strong start, a weaker middle, and a good close much like the previous novels but it entertains well enough.<br /><br />If you like this kind of stuff and want a fresh take on it, I strongly recommend the British author, James Barrington.	2005-10-12

They both drew from Rosicrucian mysticism for their respective \\"What if?\\" novels:  THE DAVINCI CODE and HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCEROR'S STONE, and they both wrote phenomenal bestsellers.  Move over because here IS Mary Jo Putney with a better \\"What IF?\\"<br /><br />The imagination tickler of both those books, and especially Ms. Putney's, is the suggestion that we are living among people with extraordinary powers that guide our lives in ways we cannot see.  The difference is that Ms. Putney's KISS OF FATE will lead you on a search for everything else she's ever written, rather than a quest to Italy to view the Mona Lisa (although that's nice too.)<br /><br />I have enjoyed all of Mary Jo Putney's historical fiction, but none more than KISS OF FATE.  It is a CLASSIC story of a `plain jane' getting the most popular, most gorgeous guy within her circle, but out of her league... except that this story is set in 18th Century Scotland and England.<br /><br />Guardians are humans with special powers to control physical science.  Gwynne is a Guardian, but more studious than powerful.  She often feels inadequate in her own circle.  Duncan Macrae, Lord Ballister and the Lord of Storms is... well, he's the Lord of Storms!  Imagine such a character.  Better yet, read about him.  One stolen kiss from Ballister and Gwynne's passion awakens... along with her natural, and individual, Guardian powers.  Imagine to what heights that can be taken!<br /><br />Read other reviews for a summary. I cannot tell you this story better than Mary Jo Putney can.  She conjures in the reader the contented feeling of being curled up in a big fluffy chair and read to by a master storyteller.  And indeed, she has been dubbed just that.  KISS OF FATE is a passionate and loving, imaginative and emotive read.  It is the best book I've read this year.<br />(...)	2005-10-12

As a kid I thought their little plots were merely amusing, but after getting out into the world and encountering the sorts of folks who make their living by ripping other people off, I could understand how any citizens of that era would have had no qualms whatever about dipping such a duo in hot tar and then feathers.  The young American West must have been rife with such con artists, and their ilk was marvelously presented in \\"Huckleberry Finn.\\"<br /><br />And as for the word we're not allowed to say, it's amazing that \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is banned in many places for its literary use of that word in a serious work of social satire/commentary -- while a film like \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" with its own liberal use of that word, and no serious purpose beyond entertainment via plot and violence, is roundly praised.

Alison Weir's The Six Wives of Henry VIII is quite possibly one of most engaging books I've read dealing with Tudor history. I'm no expert on the Tudor period, but I know enough to realize that Weir did her fair share of research. In the past I had mainly concentrated on reading about Anne Boleyn(she being the most famous of Henry's wives), and had not taken the time to study the other wives. This book endeared me very much to Catherine of Aragon and Kathryn Howard; it was an excellent experience. <br /> <br />Weir's text is written in such a way that it can be understood by someone who is a beginner in Tudor history, thus making it very accessible in a way that other writers sometimes are not. For instance, David Starkey's text on Henry's six wives is an excellent source of information, but I find his writing style a bit stuffy(no offense to any Starkey fans).  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone. Read it--you don't know what you're missing!	2005-10-12

It becomes obvious to Tohru that Haru and Yuki have a special bond with one another.<br /><br />Valentines comes around and with it a multitude of chocolates for everyone. Later Momitchi decides to thank Tohru's kindness by springing for a trip to some hot springs where they meet a very strange hostess, and mother to a member of the zodiac, the one possessed by the monkey.

This book while very informative on the health risks of drinking PASTEURIZED milk, it does a disservice to say that drinking all milk is bad for you. There is one form of milk that will make you very healthy in more ways than one. This form of milk is RAW-UNPASTEURIZED milk. Contrary to popular belief that if you drink raw milk you're going to get TB and other diseases; this simply is not true. You WON'T get ANY diseases if you find a cow that is healthy and pasture fed (Only from local sustainable farmers have truly healthy cows).  Besides sanitation nowadays is alot better compared to days of our grandmothers and grandfathers (or Greatgrandmothers etc.), refrigeration and stainless-steele have virtually gotten rid most of the problems of raw milk. Also pasteurization kills and morphs alot of the benificial enzymes and fat in the milk, making it into a destructive substance (not to mention the crap they inject into cows these days). For people who do drink the toxic commercial milk, the saturated fat in the milk is very benificial to ones health(your body and brain need it in order to function properly), but agian pasteurization heats it up to its breaking point in terms of heat and makes it destructive to ones health.	2005-10-12

It is basically a biography of two of the characters in the series. Rayford Steele and Nicolae Carpathia. Once again the typeset and fonts make the book appear to be twice as long as it really is. And though a good read. I did not have the feeling that I had to turn to the next page to see what was happening. <br /> <br />The book follows Rayford starting at age 9 determined to be an airline pilot or a professional athlete. And ends with him as the Airline Pilot we meet in the series. He was a very good athlete in school, but things kept happening to make him just not good enough in any of the sports he played to gain an athletic scholarship. So he accepts an ROTC one. He also accomplishes his goal of a private pilots license before high school graduation.  Though some of the insights he has are a little too mature for the age he has them. <br /> <br />The more interesting story is that of Nicolae Carpathia the Antichrist. And what transpire in order to pick the correct mother and father. And how much of that conspiracy the mother knew nothing about. Nicolae's conception, birth and schooling are covered. And we follow him up to the time where he was returned from his 40 days in the desert. The intelligence and lack of compassion in the boy is truly scary. <br />	2005-10-12

For example, the authors devote pages to discussing the \\"Zone of Proximal Development,\\" a concept central to understanding Vygotsky's contributions to learning theory, but never bother to explain or define it for the reader.  Moreover, the authors have a political ax to grind.  Fired up by true revolutionary zeal, they want to show that Vygotsky's ideas are thoroughly Marxian and can't be translated into any other context. Reading the book has something of the feeling of being invited to a seminar on financial planning and then discovering that the seminar is a poorly disguised infomercial for an expensive and unremunerative annuity.  Readers searching for a lucid introduction to Vygotsky should look elsewhere.	2005-10-12

Like others, i was not blown away by FC when I read it -- the first time.  But last month when time was ticking down to the publishing date for Breath of Snow and Ashes, i thought i would give it a re-read (normally i start the entire series over again, but i think i can resite most of the first few books by now...) I have to say, reading Fiery Cross the 2nd time -- i actually liked it much better than the first time.  I felt i got more out of it and it led me right into this book, so i am glad i re-read it.  <br />   <br />Breath of Snow and Ashes was great, and as others have said nearly as good as the first books.  I enjoyed Brianna coming into her own as a woman and her struggle to keep some the 20th century in her life.   It was good to see some excitement again with Claire and see Jamie continue to show his love and commitment.   I was very glad to see Ian back, he too is one of my favorite characters.    <br /> <br />The growth in Roger was some of the best part of the book and clever on Ms Gabaldon's part because it happened casually and deep into the book, you recognized he was finally comfortable in the past and has started to become Jamie's equal well, except maybe in the love scenes.. but what are you gonna do, Jamie and Claire are pushing 60, how much more bodice ripping can they do? <br /> <br />I purposely did not read any reviews until after i finished the book, so it was mixed feelings for me when it ended -- glad there was more, but kind of miffed as i read it til nearly the end believeing this was the last book.  Like others, i kept waiting for sample scenes i had read on line over the last couple of years.   But, ok the trade off of 1 or 2 more books -- totally worth it.   <br /> <br />Thank you Ms Gabaldon for a great read, thanks for tieing up some loose ends and bringing us right up to the Revolution, very clever.  Claire knows it is coming, Jamie knows it coming and we know it is coming.  Now I cant wait tosee who they meet along the way to freedom.  Make it happen soon!!	2005-10-12

If James Lee Burke hit a home run with Purple Cane Road, Jolie Blon's Bounce (the 12th in the Dave Robicheaux series) is a grand slam.<br /><br />A New Iberia teenager is brutally raped and murdered, and Tee Bobby Hulin is the key suspect.  Tee Bobby has his problems (including drugs), but Robicheaux is not convinced that Hulin is capable of such brutality.  Another girl is found murdered in the same manner, and her mobster father isn't happy with the slow pace of the police investigation.  He and a bunch of his cronies descend on New Iberia to take matters into their own hands.  A bunch of other mysterious characters also appear in New Iberia including a geeky Bible salesman and a homeless Viet Nam vet who claims to have rescued Robicheaux.  At times, it's hard to tell whether these men are harmless.  Looming over the entire book is the presence of Legion Guidry, a former overseer of a plantation and a man so evil that he almost seems inhuman.  Detective Robicheaux seems convinced that the key to solving these cases lies in something that happened to Tee Bobby's grandmother in her youth, and somehow, Legion has a part in this.<br /><br />Where Burke excels in Jolie Blon's Bounce is his observations and descriptions-especially of Louisiana.  Robicheaux's friend Clete tells him \\"This is Louisiana, Dave.  Guatemala North.  Quit pretending it's the United States.  Life will make more sense.\\"  Also, \\"A love affair with Louisiana is in some ways like falling in love with the biblical [witch] of Babylon.\\"  Burke also knows the depth and despair of the spirit when Robicheaux muses that the real enemy is \\"a violent creature who rose with me in the morning and lived quietly inside my skin, waiting for the proper moment to vent his rage upon the world.\\"  Another of my favorites is \\"the worse deeds human beings commit are precipitated by a happenstance meeting of individuals and events, who and which, if they were rearranged only lightly, would never leave a bump in our history.\\"  All of Burke's books are filled with these gems, but Jolie Blon has more than most.  There is no doubt that Burke belongs on a very short and elite list of the best mystery writers today.<br /><br />I have one more book to read in this series, his new Crusader's Cross.  There aren't too many authors who could have kept me enthralled for 14 straight books.  It might be the end of the series, but Burke still has another series as well (Billy Bob Holland).

That's the typical party-line though, so I really shouldn't be surprised.  If there's no hero-worship of Clinton, then someone should be cast aside as absolute bumbling moron.  Right.  Bottom line is that Mr. Freeh was dead on the money with his assessment of Billy boy and that's what irked Billy so much.  Billy didn't see that coming when he first appointed Mr. Freeh, but then, boy howdy how the tables did turn.  An agent who actually did his job, no matter what the stakes, and no matter whether it meant going after his boss.  (Psst...folks, in much lower levels of employment, we have things called whistle-blower laws which are similar in nature and, when utilized, tend to be regarded by the very same liberal blow-hards as sacred.)  Anyway, I digress.  When Freeh realized the scope of Billy's absolute depravity and corruption, it was an all-bets-are-off kind of deal, and the rest is history.  Now, is some other fool down below indicating that Freeh is responsible for the state of terrorism today?  I'm sorry, I thought you said a few weeks ago that \\"Dubya\\" was.  Ok, today it's Freeh.  Yeah, right.  Sorry fella, that fault rests with Billy Boy too, who was handed these terrorists many times but declined to act.  Ultimate responsibitly and ultimate authority people...that's the point.  And that's the scope of this treatise. Get over your stupidity and politics and just take a gander for a second at the simple truth of history as it has been played out and firmly established.

The writing is clear. The story-telling is superb. But most of all, the broad perspective and specific analysis of how things work in China combine to deliver a compelling guide for anyone who wants to better understand that mysterious country. It is deeply revealing about Chinese culture, pointedly instructive about why China is such a hard place to do business and ultimately satisfying with its description of success stories.  <br /> <br />McGregor came up with a structure that works well. Each chapter tells the story of a particular corner of China business, with a context that is drawn with a journalist's economy and insight, and then a conclusion about what it means. The first one, about Morgan Stanley's efforts to create the first Western-Chinese investment bank, is simply masterful: An engrossing tale, with fascinating characters and a sequence of events that tells a lot about how surprising, frustrating and exciting it can be to work in China. McGregor is remarkably clear-eyed about China, quite admiring and then equally candid about its shortcomings. You trust him as a narrator, because he is evidently in command of his material, but also because he has an incisive eye for human behavior, cultural misconceptions and dumb luck. It makes the whole book very readable and quite enjoyable.  <br /> <br />In contrast to many other books that portray China as a machine, or a cold monolithic state, 'One Billion Customers' is deeply perceptive about China's true strengths and glaring weaknesses. The author's personal background comes through clearly: as a journalist, and then as a businessman, he has learned a tremendous amount about how things work in China, and lucky for us, he has the writing ability to communicate it with us. Highly recommended.	2005-10-12

It's up to her to find out what exactly happened - and prove that she hasn't compromised national security - before she loses her job, which appears to be the one thing that matters to her. Helping her is Captain Mark Cross, who's also undergone the same experience.<br /><br />The pair have some chemistry and the opening scenes read well, but the book gets more and more implausible as it goes. Most notably, given the assumption that *anyone* could be a double, the heroine is remarkably cavalier with who she trusts. Fortunately for her, most doubles are clearly identified; the ones that aren't are not-so-cleverly signposted for the reader, and there aren't that many of them.<br /><br />It's a world where high security facilities have cameras and guards everywhere except where they don't, the bad guys will happily switch between terrorizing a and woman as re-creating her entire living space, right down to the clothes in her dresser so that they can \\"observe her acting naturally\\" (Which happens so often in post-beating captivity). Even the relationship between the villian and the doubles, once explained, is so needlessly complicated that one can easily think of at least three alternate solutions that'd work just as well for the villian.<br /><br />And that's the problem. Hinze creates a situation where it's only logical to second-guess everything, and then expects readers to accept some rather shaky premises without question. Her love story is at times clunky but does have a few significant bright spots, and her lead is particularly likeable and easy to root for, but overall, when I realized that all the irrational things I was reading *weren't* actually a setup for a big underlying reveal, finishing the book became a chore.<br /><br />Fortunatlely for me, it is also of note that the book ends rather abruptly. There is a clear setup for a sequel; one I will probably skip.ularly likeable and easy to root for, but overall, when I realized that all the irrational things I was reading *weren't* actually a setup for a big underlying reveal, finishing the book became a chore. <br /> <br />Fortunatlely for me, it is also of note that the book ends rather abruptly.

At a time of growing anti-Semitism (the first edition was written in 1926 and an update was published in Paris in 1937) and an immigration crisis affecting Germany as countless refugees poured into Berlin from the East, Roth--himself a Jew from Galicia, the easternmost part of the former Austrian empire--creates a sympathetic yet clearsighted portrait of contemporary Jewish life. In the process he effectively responds to all the stereotypes and libels heaped on East European Jews. For the contemporary reader, however, what is most affecting about this portrait is Roth's ability to convey a panorama of Jewish life on the brink of destruction. Though no one (except maybe Hitler) could have predicted, even in 1937, the extent of the devastation that would be visited on European Jewry, Roth's writing in this book serves as an indelible and moving memorial to a civilization that would soon disappear forever. It must therefore count among the first books in what would now be called \\"Holocaust literature,\\" and one of the most meaningful works of protest literature--protest against the stereotypes that reduced Jews to objects of scorn and contempt; protest against the violence that would ensue from these stereotypes--of all time. Michael Hofmann's understated and articulate translation of this poignant, heartbreaking little book is a tremendous service for English-language readers. It fills in a vital space in the emerging image of Joesph Roth, a writer finally receiving his due in the precincts of European modernism, and it should be read by everyone interested in good writing and the problems of 20th century history.	2005-10-12

She hasn't accepted moving away from the family homestead,and is determined not to like her new bright modern home an hour's drive away from her friends. <br /> <br />When her father is killed by a hit-and-run driver, she refuses to believe he's gone.  She closes herself off from the busy-ness of grief, the details of the funeral where someone who didn't even know her father speaks about his life.  She plays with her friends without letting them talk about her dad, and tells her young brother Tycho that Dad isn't really gone.  He doesn't really believe her, but he adores his big sister and wants the same thing she wants: for Dad to come walking in the door. <br /> <br />Jessica decides to take Tycho and hike to her old house, where Daddy's Climbing Tree, an enormous beech stands.  After many adventures, she and Tycho reach the tree.  Carved into its trunk are the initials of those who have climbed it.  Jessica goes higher than she's ever gone, pushing herself to the limit, not caring that she might not have the strength to climb down, because maybe she doesn't want to climb down.

US	42418507	R23HNOQV066YXG	0912516313	887057551	Heaven and Other Poems	Books	2	7	7	N	N	Only for the completist	This book isn't worth the money unless you absolutely must have everything Kerouac ever wrote. It's only got about 40 pages of poems, and if that's not bad enough, most all of the poems are published in other books.  <br /> <br />\\"San Francisco Blues: Two Choruses,\\" \\"Orizaba Blues: Four Choruses,\\" and \\"Orlando Blues: 31st Chorus\\" can all be found in their entirety in Book of Blues, which is highly recommended if only because it contains the excellent \\"San Francisco Blues.\\" \\"MacDougal Street Blues\\" and \\"My Gang\\" are in the wonderful & inconsistent collection Pomes All Sizes. The \\"Poems for Don Allen's Anthology\\" are choruses from \\"Mexico City Blues,\\" chosen for Don Allen's anthology by Allen Ginsberg. The 20 pages of letters by Kerouac to Don Allen, while interesting, presumably can be found in Kerouac's Collected Letters. The letters also contain a \\"Biographical Resume\\" and \\"Biography\\" written by Kerouac (included in other books, I think--Good Blonde?), his statement on poetics and poetry found in Don Allen's anthology, and \\"Belief & Technique for Modern Prose: List of Essentials\\" found in the Beat Reader and Good Blonde. <br /> <br />So, what does that leave? Not much. The only things I'm pretty sure can't be found anywhere else are the 1958 poems \\"A TV Poem\\" and \\"Heaven,\\" totaling 10 pages, as well as a one-page cartoon entitled \\"Doctor Sax and the Deception of the Sea Shroud\\" drawn at Neal Cassady's house circa 1953-54. And the two poems aren't even that good. However, \\"Heaven\\" is very interesting in that it marks a clear shift between Kerouac's Buddhist period and his later alcoholic Catholicism, and it gives us insight into Kerouac's Christian beliefs. A couple interesting quotes from \\"Heaven\\": <br /> <br />\\"The Church? Earth's dogmatic mistakes have nothing to do with Heaven\\" <br /> <br />\\"For we all go back where we came from, God's Lit Brain, his transcendent Eye of Wisdom / And there's your bloody circle called samsara by the ignorant Buddhists, who will still be funny Masters up there, bless em.\\" <br /> <br />Oh, so now the Buddhists are ignorant? and this was written just a year or two after The Dharma Bums, wow. <br /> <br />So anyways, this book has a good deal of interesting stuff -- poems, letters, autobiographies, statements -- but most of it can be found elsewhere. If you don't have Book of Blues, Mexico City Blues, and Pomes All Sizes yet, don't bother with this book. But if you gotta have it all, then by all means get it.  <br /> <br />Peace. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

The story is the second book in a series. It begins right where it left off from the first book, Across the Nightingale Floor. It alternates from the voice of Takeo to the omnipresent narrator who shadows Takeo's lover, Kaede Shirakawa. Romance, endurance, and violence make this tale a must read because the author makes the reader feel as if he is part of whole experience. <br /> <br />This book has some challenging reading. Hearn's style is loaded with imagery and empathy. Every page I read I feel like I know and understand all the pains Takeo and Kaede go through, and their longing for each other. Hearn is an unbelievably talented writer. She draws out my emotions. She makes me feel sorry for both of them. At times, I wanted to dive into the pages and help them succeed with their missions. In Every chapter, Hearn switches from Takeo's point of view to the narration of Kaede's endeavors. I feel their pain, their thoughts of longing. As I read each chapter, their longing becomes greater and more passionate. Takeo's trials are the most absorbing for me as a male reader. His experiences with pain, combat, and love interested me the most. I felt like I personally knew his lifestyle and his every reaction. I practically cheered him on like a fan in the stands, hoping that he somehow gets back to Kaede. They are two people in love who are separated, and she makes me see how love is an impenetrable magnet that cannot be broken. The author's style brings out a level of empathy for two main characters that I have never experienced before in a novel. <br />	2005-10-12

US	27312203	RD3CTENF4004F	0822333171	451815278	Right to Rock: The Black Rock Coalition and the Cultural Politics of Race	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Maureen Mahon's Right to Rock: the Black Rock Coalition and the Cultural Politics of Race	.  When we think of rock `n' roll, the first image that comes to mind is the white male guitarist, or the iconic Led Zeppelin.  Ironically, it was not this credited white male who invented rock 'n' roll in the 1940's and 1950's, but southern black artists such as Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and Etta James.  It is still debated how large of a role these black artists had in revolutionizing the music industry through the introduction of rock.  After the death of Jimi Hendrix, a rock legend, black rock music disappeared from the mainstream.  In the post-civil rights era, white Americans popularized rock music, and the culture became associated with white aesthetics rather than black.  Throughout the past few decades, the music industry has made it inconceivable to embrace black rocker music into mainstream pop culture.  During the 1980's black rock musicians and listeners were ostracized by society for falling out of the black mainstream and norm, and were classified as not being `black enough'.  In order to survive in the industry, many black musicians were forced to reconstruct their music and tastes based on the racial identities that existed in society.  In 1985 Greg Tate, Konda Mason, and Vernon Reid, became aware of this unfortunate situation and founded the Black Rock Coalition (BRC) in New York City, and in Los Angeles in 1989. In the book Right to Rock, cultural anthropologist Maureen Mahon takes an ethnographic approach by observing and participating in the proactive organization and role of the BRC.  She states, \\"Their goal in forming the organization was to bring together musicians and their supporters so they could begin to address the music industry's resistance to black rock (pg. 7).\\"  In order to expand the stereotypes of black identity, the BRC further expressed the idea that black rock was anything but an oxymoron.<br /><br /> Members of the BRC were mainly middle-class college educated African-American men and women between the ages of twenty and forty.  It was common for a BRC member to have experienced integration in their schools during the 1960's and 1970's.  As a result, their musical tastes were `culturally contaminated' by non-blacks in their environment.  They integrated this wider perspective of music into their own practices, and enjoyed the same musical tastes of some of their white peers.  Unfortunately, black rockers were marginalized by producers, record companies, and whites, for not being `black enough'.  Mahon explains this choice of `staying true' to one's blackness and the dilemma in producing a crossover album: \\"Many black artists and audiences see crossover as a choice that requires crossing out aspects of one's blackness to gain mainstream pop chart visibility (pg. 158).\\"  In 1988, MTV aired a song from the black rock band, Living Colour.  Many BRC members were discouraged by their success because it was a result of British rock star Mick Jagger, who persuaded Epic records to sign the band.  Mahon added, \\"Most disturbing for BRC members was the fact that a white star had to validate a black band before it could gain recognition (156).\\"  Unfortunately, the group's success was limited and their acceptance never accumulated in mainstream black culture.  Even more, these rockers were recognized by other blacks for neglecting their racial roots.  In the context of the post-civil rights movement and the racism that continually persisted, many blacks began to emphasize their differences from whites.  The author notes that \\"this process fixed the meaning of black and set the terms of post-civil rights era notions of black authenticity (pg. 117).\\"  Members of the BRC avoided the identities established by this movement and challenged the assumptions of rock and race.  They promoted bands such as Bad Brains, Living Colour, and Fishbone, by resourcefully creating venues and opportunities in clubs and bars in New York City for bands to gain exposure and generate a fan base.  They not only sponsored events, but they provided outlets for black musicians to produce CDs, expose themselves in newsletters and radio shows, and popularize their message by `word of mouth'.  Instead of attacking the institution that had excluded blacks in the rock world, they decided to create their own genre.<br /><br /> The coalition discussed a myriad of issues during their meetings each week and allowed people from different backgrounds a chance to voice concerns and organize resolutions for change.  One of the most salient issues that Mahon voiced throughout her book was the strict assumption on what constituted authentic black music.  Black authenticity is commonly associated with the ethics of the working-class.  Lower-class blacks ostracized middle-class blacks because they were seen as neglecting their true blackness by assimilating into white culture.  Mahon describes this dilemma when she says \\"on the one hand their blackness limited full acceptance by whites in situations where integration did not eliminate racialization...some blacks felt that their association with what was perceived to be white institutions and practices compromised their blackness (pg. 58).\\"  Black rockers are torn by the idea of a `double-consciousness' and are constantly questioned about their true identity.  As a result of this double-consciousness they are forced to justify themselves because they do not fall under the normal characterizations of black or white.  Another important issue that Mahon touches upon is the paradox of black authenticity, or society's `anxiety of influence'.  Blacks and whites, in trying to build their `cultural capital', too often forget that culture is learned. They overlook the fact that one's identity is influenced by other races, cultures, and ideas.  The author strongly states, \\"One is black not simply because of ancestry or phenotype but because of practice and consciousness...This perspective reminds us that blackness is created, enacted, and produced through the choices we make (pg. 11).\\"  Black and white authenticities are not exclusive from one another.  Black rockers have accepted their multicultural existence and claim their blackness to be defined by more than one race.  There is no way to classify black music, and what is authentic cannot be over-generalized within a society.  Black rockers questioned the stereotypes of both white rock and black mainstreams and created their own forms of identity through rock music.<br /><br /> Throughout Right to Rock, Maureen Mahon effectively uses the Black Rock Coalition to emphasize how society places stereotypical restrictions on groups of people that hold a similar position of race, class, gender, religion, and culture.  This book is a profound research study to explore how the BRC redefined the appropriateness of black music.  It clearly demonstrates how race has little determination in an individual's musical preference.  As the book unfolds, the author brings to surface the limitations of black aesthetics in social, political, and economic contexts.	2005-10-12

As a long time fan of the nostalgic Marvel Essential series (click on my \\"See all my reviews\\" button if you don't believe me), I also made sure to pick up Loeb & Sale's well-regarded \\"color\\" books (Spider-Man: Blue, Daredevil: Yellow, and Hulk: Gray).  These three series replayed moments in Marvel's past which primarily centered around the heroes' lost loves Gwen Stacy (the Marvel universe's original slain girlfriend), Karen Page and Betty Ross while offering new philosophical or psychological angles about why their loves began and continued under the stress and difficulty of the heroes' secret double lives.  In the first two books, the stories were updated or \\"ret-conned\\" in order to be relevant for the modern era (Flash Thompson signs on to the Army as opposed to being drafted to fight in `Nam) and some new scenes were added (Mr. Slade, the man who pulled the trigger on Matt Murdock's father, received the death penalty), but generally the proceedings didn't stray too far from the classic tales from which they were based.  This is not true for Hulk: Gray, the third book I read.  It is more of an original than an adaptation and, despite my craving for nostalgia, it is also my favorite of the three.<br /><br />Hulk: Gray revolves around the always embattled Bruce Banner meeting with long-time friend Leonard \\"Doc\\" Samson for a late-night impromptu therapy session to discuss Bruce's grief over the loss of his first love Betty.  Bruce goes back to that fateful day when he saved young Rick Jones life, only to be rewarded with a Gamma-radiated curse, and how he then tried to avoid trouble and express his love for Betty in his confused, clumsy, and supremely powerful Hulk persona.  In the final chapter, the aptly named \\"F is for Father,\\" Bruce comes across a hypothesis as to why the frail and timid Betty learned to accept him as an unpredictable monster.  I'm not certain if the idea had ever been discussed before, but if true then it is profoundly tragic, even when compared to all the other moments of profound tragedy which the Hulk is famous for.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, Jeph Loeb spins a mostly new tale surrounding the Hulk's origin and I maintain that the book is all the better for it.  The Hulk was the first \\"superhero\\" series begun after the Fantastic Four and it only lasted a meager six issues mainly because Stan Lee, \\"the Man\\" that he is, severely mishandled the character.  New powers and traits of the Hulk were introduced and dropped within the blink of an eye; for example, the Hulk could originally fly and Banner transformed at dusk and turned back at dawn.  He's not a vampire, Stan!  Also, I was happy not to see any of the early super-villians show up, like the deformed Russian Gargoyle or the subterranean tyrant Tyrannus (he's like a handsome Mole Man) or the Toad Men from Outer Space or the Metal Master (he's like Magneto except not intimidating in the least).  The Hulk just doesn't need much external conflict to make his stories interesting; his worst enemy has always been himself.  Lastly, Iron Man is called in to stop the Hulk in a scene that boldly flies in the face of established continuity (in the pages of Avengers #1, Tony Stark himself says, \\"I've always wondered whether the Hulk really existed\\").  Regardless, ol' Shell-head's \\"untold\\" appearance made for a hard-hitting brawl the likes of which the historical Hulk wouldn't see until he met the Abomination, and so I think you'll be pleased that it's there.<br /><br />All three of the Loeb/Sale modern retrospective books for Marvel are worth reading, but I'd recommend Hulk: Gray the most.  It combines the fascinating emotional layers of the green Hulk of today with the sheer power and mystery of the gray Hulk of yesterday.  It's the origin of the most powerful creature on Earth the best way it could be told.red to all the other moments of profound tragedy which the Hulk is famous for.  <br /> <br />As I mentioned before, Jeph Loeb spins a mostly new tale surrounding the Hulk's origin and I maintain that the book is all the better for it.

Owens takes us on the vivid journey of Morris \\"Mookie Love\\" Lovett as he pursues his dream to become a star rapper.  Owens' \\"A Dream Come True\\", starts out innocently enough with Mookie finding out that he won a major talent contest that his best friend, Fatimus Brown, had entered for him.  The trouble begins as soon as Mookie gets the good news; his father, former professional basketball star, is adamantly opposed to Mookie becoming a rapper and moving to Los Angeles.<br /><br />Mookie refuses to give up his dream and forges ahead bringing Pam Rivera, his longtime girlfriend, and Fatimus (\\"Fat\\" as they call him) with him to L.A. to pursue their own dreams.  Immediately, Mookie begins to succumb to the trappings of being famous as drugs and women threaten his relationships with both Fat and Pam.  Mookie becomes so caught up in being famous that he fails to notice the deceptions around him.  Once he does, is he too far out of control to understand the consequences of the choices he has made?<br /><br />Meanwhile, Pam and Fat experience a little drama of their own.  Torn between supporting Mookie and acheiving their own goals, Pam and Fatimus turn to each other creating a twist that leads to a interesting revelation.  Even while Pam longs for the Mookie that she knew before all the fame began, she drifts away from him hiding her own secrets and reeling from his betrayals.  Fatimus hopes to create some interest in his own life, other than being middleman to Mookie and Pam's relationship.  Bored of playing online chess and watching Sci-fi movies, Fat makes several comedic attempts at dating. Still, Fatimus has some decisions to make once he is dealt several major blows in his life.<br /><br />These three have been friends a long time, but the questions remain: can their friendship withstand the move to Los Angeles and the glare of Mookie's fame? Can they stand up to the lies and betrayals? Will they still be friends once all truths are exposed? Can Mookie get his life back on track or has his dream turned into a nightmare?<br /><br />Owens does an excellent job of pulling you into the story of Mookie, Pam, and Fatimus making you care about these characters and what will happen to them next.

Also, he makes note of Springsteen's use of humour in songs like Glory Days. He really delves into the genesis of some songs like the title track. Also as an added bonus there's lots of information here on the making of Nebraska. There is a very valuable disography at the back of the book. Reading the book brought back a lot of amusing memories how right-wingers such as Ronald Reagan and George Will embraced this album and artist. They didn't quite get Springsteen and his work.

There are many great things I could say about this book, but what amazes me the most about \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is that it's a work of fiction. Arthur Golden does a marvelous job of transporting the reader to 1920s Japan, where a young girl is sold to an okiya and overcomes numerous struggles to become one of the most prestigious geishas in all of Gion. We witness how young Chiyo transforms into Sayuri despite the greedy owners of her okiya and the antics of Hatsumomo, a sadistic geisha who does everything in her power to prevent Sayuri's success. \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" is also a love story of sorts: Chiyo's chance meeting with the Chairman when she is a young girl is an event that shapes her destiny. However, as Mameha says in the novel, women become geishas because they have no choice, and they are forced to make massive sacrifices because of it.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book. Parts of the story are heartbreaking, but Golden throws some great humorous bits into the mix for the reader's enjoyment. This is a novel that I couldn't put down: I stayed up until after 3 a.m. because I HAD to finish it before going to bed!

It was almost indistinguishable from the latest Princess Diaries book. The voice was the same and the heroine's concerns were the same (sex and how naked men are funny-looking). Sam was more of a Mia Thermopolis than her own character.<br /><br />2. There was too much of the reader knowing what was going on while the characters were inexplicably clueless. It's a drag to watch characters being stupid. I lose respect for them and quit caring what happens, especially since it's so OBVIOUS what's going to happen.<br /><br />3. When something unexpected DOES happen, it's out of the blue and not supported by who we know the characters to be. And afterwards, it's resolved by not being that much of a big deal after all. Well then, why was it worth writing or reading a book about?<br /><br />It was an easy read (I zoomed through it, and that's why it gets 2 stars instead of 1), but that's about it. The supposed political messages were dramatized unrealistically (yeah sure, the whole lunchroom is going to stand up against the catty girl) and the characters and humor just weren't substantial enough to make up for it. I recommend the early Princess Diaries books instead, or The Boy Next Door.	2005-10-12

At the end of his life, Grant was considered a great president but a bad general.  Gradually, in the next fifty years after Grant's death, as the fawning cult of Robert E. Lee admirers grew among historians, it became an unexamined article of faith among civil war historians that in addition to being a mediocre general U.S. Grant was a bad president.<br /><br />In reality, Grant was the greatest general the U.S. ever produced and one of the five greatest presidents the country has ever innagurated.  When you read a book like Mr. Korda's you can be sure that either he is a member of this Lee cult, or he has not done his research.  Which of these is true about Mr. Korda, I don't know, but I would make a significant wager that one or both is true.<br /><br />Grant was more than an honest steady hand guiding the ship of state, he unflinchingly guided the country down a path of reconciliation and reconstruction that preserved the victories he and his men had won on the battlefield.<br /><br />It would be another 100 years before the White House was occupied by a man with less race bias than U.S. Grant.<br /><br />Other than George Washington, Grant was by far the most the least beholden to his party and most apolitical man to ever hold the office.  He defied his party, congress and his own personal friends when he believed they were wrong and was proven right in his judgments.<br /><br />Another article of faith regarding Grant is that although he personally was absolutely honest and above reproach he lead the most corrupt administration in U.S. History.  The reality of the situation is that his administration was no more corrupt than those which preceded it and those that followed.  Where Grant distinguished himself was in decisive, unequivocal and forthright action against both friend and foe who were found guilty.  Placing the corruption of the Grant administration in context is almost never done by Grant's biographers.<br /><br />Grant is often portrayed by historians who should know better as a hapless bungler, who was in way over his head as president, if fact the opposite is true.  Mr. Korda, is sympathetic to Grant, but lacks a true understanding of the man.yed by historians who should know better as a hapless bungler, who was in way over his head as president, if fact the opposite is true.

It is over a hundred years since Darwin revealed to us our animal lineage, and yet the human primate is still having difficulty coming to terms with its animal origins.  All bar creationists may indeed now accept that we are descended from apes, but most of us still cling to the belief that we have somehow become different to the rest of the animal kingdom.  Our ability to use language and reason, to see ourselves as selves, selves that move forward in time and, with other selves, progress by building a culture based on moral rules and a technology that seems to give us ever increasing control over our environment.  Surely this is enough to set us apart from the rest of nature?  No. Thankfully, a British philosopher who lives and breathes today but who speaks with the depth and clarity of a modern day Schopenhauer is here to rid you of this delusion.<br /><br />Human beings are still animals claims Gray, but the more profound insight that he delivers, and that his critics seem unable to grasp or admit, is that humans, and even whatever intelligence that might emerge in a 'posthuman' future, will always be inescapably rooted in the natural world as much as the lowliest of slime molds.<br /><br />We believe that language and reason are what differentiates us, forgetting that we acquired these abilities through the blind mechanisms of evolution.  This means that they are, as Hume, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche declared long before Darwin, mere tools in the brutish struggle for survival.  These same tools enabled the human animal to create the illusions of free will, self and morality and the delusion to think that with these, man has the ability to stand apart from the animal world and choose his own fate.  But the fundamental import of Darwinism is that it tells us that 'we' were 'made' for the world.  The world was not made for us, nor can we ever make it, nor indeed any world, to be for us.<br /><br />Some rather simple-minded criticisms of Gray's outlook are floating around the Internet, including on this page, so lest they deter you from reading this book, here are a few brief rejoinders that can be made to them.<br /><br />1/ 'Gray teaches us nothing new. Postmodernism has been around for 40 years now.'  Gray clearly isn't giving just another rehash of postmodernist thought.  In fact his book is a savage attack on some of the postmodernist thought that has now been neatly incorporated into liberal thinking.  The belief that the world is entirely a social construction, that this construction is determined by power relationships and that therefore by changing those power relationships society can mould the world into whatever form it chooses.  The way that humans see the world may indeed be due to power relationships within society, but these arise because of the fact that humans are biological animals in an inherently competitive natural world.  Postmodernism is, as Gray says, 'just the latest fad in anthropocentrism'.<br /><br />2/ 'Gray criticises science as a faith but seems to hold Darwinism as a faith.'  Gray is primarily attacking the faith that scientific progress leads to moral and social progress.  If anything is right in science it is the broad theory of Darwinism.  Yet people believe that science can enable man to take control of his destiny, when one of the most fundamental tenets of modern science teaches us that science and its consequences (as with any other sphere of human activity) is ultimately determined by the same laws that govern other animals' behaviour.<br /><br />3/ 'No-one seriously believes in progress anymore'.  Well the western world is without doubt led by two men who wholeheartedly believe in the vision of moral progress, as we are seeing with disastrous consequences in Iraq.  As both have been re-elected as their heads of government, presumably a lot of the people who voted for them share that vision. The idea that western society is not still dominated by the belief in moral progress is absurd.A generation ago homosexuality was illegal and homosexuals were routinely sent to prison.  Today, someone can be sent to prison for simply arguing that homosexuality is wrong.  For this to be the case, society clearly has a conviction that the moral attitudes of today are without question a progression on the attitudes of yesterday. To give a different example, on the 10th of September 2001 not one person in a hundred could have believed that America would soon be holding a serious debate on whether or not to legalise torture.<br /><br />It goes without saying that I found Straw Dogs to be an utterly rewarding intellectual experience.  Read it and it may change the whole way you look at the world...though probably together with a feeling that, like all great writers, Gray has articulated for you something profound that you always suspected about the world.is absurd.

In Medalon, she provided an excellently twisting narrative that kept things moving briskly while at the same time changing paths to keep you guessing.  Added to it was a dash of political intrigue handled in an exciting and very readable manner that never bogged down the action or the story. <br /> <br />My biggest complaint about Medalon was the character development.  Mainly, the characters all had their roles to fill and they rarely (if ever) stretched very far past their roles.  You had Loclon, the handsome antagonist who becomes scarred and is filled with hatred.  You had Joyhinia, the scheming mother who is a bad seed and causes nothing but trouble.  And you had the protagonists, Targ who comes across as more altruistic than anything and R'shiel.  They never really broke free of their roles and you don't see much change except the possibility of their hatred/altruism growing stronger.  Not saying the characters aren't interesting, but as far as complex?  There are more complex characters out there. <br /> <br />Now we have Treason Keep and it is even better and Fallon has made strides to help the characters.  She also introduces one of my favorite in the series in Adrina.  Adrina is a fun character and she actually has a definite progression in this novel that is fun, humorous and exciting to watch grow.  But the best part of these novels is the plot and the pacing and I'm happy to report that Fallon keeps Treason Keep's plot moving quick and exciting.   <br /> <br />Fans of Medalon will revel in the twisting plot and how things wrap up at the end, setting up the final book which I hope will be truly climactic.  If you enjoyed Medalon, I would definitely recommend continuing with the series.  This novel is a huge step in the right direction.  I hope this trend continues for the epic conclusion.	2005-10-12

Haru Sohma's personality suddenly goes black in school and he begins tearing up the classroom for no obvious reason. Yuki attempts to get the reason for these actions only to learn of some dealings with Akito that Haru has had to suffer from lately. Ritsu Sohma shows up, dressed all in a pretty kimono, this Sohma member dazzles Tohru with her good looks, and horrifies her with her inherent anxiety attacks. But the truth of Ritsu lies under the surface, and Tohru is surprised to learn it. Besides that, Ritsu is also a zodiac member, the monkey, born in 1980 I estimate. Ritsu and Tohru bond after Ritsu confesses some personality flaws to Tohru. Yuki also checks up on Haru, to see how he is doing after turning black at school.<br /><br />School parent/teacher conferences are coming up, and the Sohma house is all in a panic over it. Kyo and Yuki don't know who to ask to attend, and much time is spent agonizing over what their future plans are. Tohru also breaks down a bit under the stress of all of this.<br /><br />A reoccurring dream of Yuki's past puts him into a foul mood, as does a surprise visit from his brother Ayami. In an attempt to heal their broken past Ayami offers to attend the school conferences in place of Yuki and his parents.<br /><br />Summer vacation begins with a trip to the haunted mansion for everyone. For Tohru this is a disturbing experience, as she is terrified of haunted houses. Haru helps her through it with some creative thinking, much to Yuki and Kyo's annoyance.<br /><br />More Haru...sigh... there simply isn't enough Haru in this series I'm afraid. But fans of him will get just enough of a peek into his life to be satisfied. Ritsu is a bit annoying, but you need that to balance out the strength of all the other characters... Still in love with this series though, who isn't by this point?	2005-10-12

Tohru's best friends Arisa Uotani and Hanajima decide to come to meet the Sohmas when Tohru finally reveals that she is living with them. They approve of the household and all seems well. Tohru is becoming friendlier with both Yuki and Kyo, though the boys end up fighting constantly. Fellow Sohma member, Momitchi, comes to Tohru's work to meet her, and then to a school festival organized by Tohru's class. Momitchi was born in the year of the rabbit and he shows up with Hatori Sohma, a friend of Shigure's. Yuki is made to dress up as a girl to attract attention to their exhibit, and is horrified at the prospect. But this leads to some tender moments between him and Tohru.<br /><br />Later Hatori asks Tohru to come to the main Sohma house, and this comes right after a warning from Yuki that he was responsible for erasing people's memories in the past. Tohru reluctantly goes and learns of an incident from Hatori's past that still haunts him, along with what zodiac sign he is (the dragon, which manifests itself to resemble a seahorse).<br /><br />New Years also comes and Yuki and Kyo must go to the main house to celebrate, but decide to rebel and spend the time with Tohru instead. What repercussions can this decision have when Akito learns of it?<br /><br />The series is still wonderful, even more so than I thought it was going to be. A must read for any manga fan.	2005-10-12

The author is ranting instead of calmly stating a realistic argument.  If I understood correctly, she believes that the Wedding Industrial Complex (with some vague notions of society and government) CAUSES women to desire marriage, view themselves as princesses and then spend as much money as possible on the wedding. <br />Although her argument is far-reaching her facts are extremely narrow- (she spends a chunk of the book repeating herself with magazine advertising statistics). <br />If her point was to let us know that many business owners within the wedding industry do not operate out of good will but are in fact out to make as much money as possible, point taken.  But I knew that before I read the book.	2005-10-12

This was a book that I really wanted to like, but I found the entire premise and content a little too 'precious' for my tastes. As a devoted tea drinker, I was hoping to find some new ideas for what to serve up to go with my afternoon break -- instead, while some of the stories and touches of humor are funny, the ingredients were just a bit too odd for me to contemplate. Too, the book gets overly cute in spots, and while I do admire the author's stand on vegantarism, his self-effacing manner really begins to grate after about the fifth time that he mentions that he's trying not to be self-promoting.

There were parts I skipped over rather quickly because I felt I didn't need to know all the details. There are lots of startlingly thought-provoking statements. I was amused/frustrated by Campbell's use of odd or obscure words, eg. \\"loathly\\", \\"cathected\\". <br /> <br />I found the book very helpful in that it encouraged me to examine the events in my life to try to work out where they have tied in with aspects of the hero myth. <br /> <br />Campbell says (p 249) that \\"Wherever the poetry of myth is interpreted as biography, history or science, it is killed. .... Such a blight has certainly descended on the Bible and on a great part of the Christian cult.\\" I think I am right in saying that Campbell (1) promotes the myth as a valuable tool in living life to the full, but (2) does not see any \\"hyper-myth\\" which connects to a reality beyond the physical world. For one who was brought up on the Christian myth, that's challenging.	2005-10-12

The women whose lives are described here range from Wilma Mankiller (that's her real name...), the former leader of the Cherokee tribe, to the famous environmental activist Julia Hill, to amazing triathletes like Angelika Castaneda and Barbara Warren--just to name a few. <br />Although the book obviously caters to an audience of women, it is not just a feminist celebration of strong, independent ladies. In many ways, Reckless is an open call for anyone, men as well as women, to find the guts to defy social expectations in an effort to live out one's dreams. Gender issues are clearly an important part of the book, but the main theme is a celebration of the courage needed to step out into the unknown and create our own destinies. All the ladies featured here offer excellent, albeit very different, examples of people who don't simply pay homage to these ideals, but put them in practice. Mattioni is not selling a product or trying to convince everyone to follow \\"her way.\\"  Rather, by showing the variety in the experience of these women, she is inviting the readers to find their own personal way to a fulfilling life.   <br />In theory, this concept may not be particularly original. Most feel-good movies and books celebrate the hero who creates his/her own destiny. But in reality the number of people who actually do this, and live their days without regrets are so few as to make a book like this appear as the antidote to all the negative social conditionings we are fed on a daily basis. On the road to doing what they want in life, in fact, the ladies in the book overcome tremendous pressures of people inviting them to give up their ideals and be more realistic. <br />Overall, the book is beautifully written and very enjoyable to read. Great topic, great style, great stories.My only regret is that Mattioni should have told us more about her own life, since she seems to be as tough and courageous as any of the women she describes.	2005-10-12

The exceptional color photography is unique in that it captures birds at some of their most unique moments - a mallard taking interest in a turtle, a grackle just as it launches yet an instant before it spreads its wings, a northern flicker with its tongue out, and more. Birds Of Central Park is enthusiastically recommended, especially for dedicated bird watchers and ornithologists.	2005-10-12

I gave Passion a re-read, skimming the painful sex scenes, and the romance was just so-so.

Good Arguments, Good Writing, Well Documented	Skinner is one of few scholars who can authoritatively explain the intricate and reflexive history of western political thought (especially if you are confined to English language books only) while still holding one's complete attention.  I've not yet read a book by Skinner that i didn't find excellent and wholly satisfying as regards wants and expectations.      I picked up this book wanting to know more about the evolution of civic republicanism as it emerged from the city-states of Renaissance Italy and evolved subsequently, and especially how that tradition related to 17th century British 'liberal' thought.  I learned just that.  Moreover, the first two essays and the later essay on Milton are truly exemplary pieces of essay writing.      On different note, the book is exceptionally well documented.  If you rarely read just one book on a given subject, the bibliography Skinner provides is a gem by itself - and well worth the price of the book solely as a reference.  I'm sure those who have similar reading habits, or are simply interested in the history of civic republicanism, you will feel likewise.  For those who, again, are restricted to English only, the bibliography reaffirms just how much otherwise exclusive history Skinner provides in his essays.  Most - I would guess - of his sources are in Italian, Latin, French, etc.  I don't see how anyone could finish this book without feeling well enough informed on a very extensive and intricate subject; or at least feeling well directed to further resources.      The only criticism that comes to mind - and it is hardly even that - is that the reading can be quite dense.  So I would remind the casual reader that Skinner's book, though very well written, is an academic book nonetheless.       I highly recommend this book, as well as any other by Skinner.	2005-10-12

Well, Dayton Duncan spent a couple of years visiting those American counties that still meet the definition of frontier -- less than two people per square mile.<br /><br />In Miles From Nowhere, Duncan sheds light on what it means to live alone, really alone, no neighbors in sight or in small communities where there is no \\"next town over.\\"  There are quite a few counties in the mid-west and far west that meet the Census Bureau definition and the author provides an excellent sampling of what makes people stay or in some case move here.<br /><br />The place stories are sometimes fascinating and also interesting.  One area of Nevada was the fallout zone for early nuclear tests -- chosen because it was almost empty.  Duncan explores some of the people who lived under where the white ash fell and explores their continuing health problems as well as their exasperation with an unresponsive government.<br /><br />In Montana, there are still one-room schools where teachers live in trailers at the school site and teach one to ten kids from an attendance area measured in the hundreds or thousands of square miles.  There are people in the mountains of Washington and Oregon who pack their cars with a week's worth of provisions in case they break down because that's how long it could take someone else to happen upon their stalled vehicle.  And in Love County Texas, a county with under 1,000 people, the local elections are decided by feuds and family grudges that separate people into warring camps for elected offices which hold no real power and have no real money to spend.<br /><br />I found a peak into these lives and stories fascinating and couldn't put the book down.  Duncan has a way of getting these folks to open up and treats them matter-of-factly in a manner which allows the stories to speak for themselves.<br /><br />This is a very interesting book that opens up a part of America that almost all of the rest of us will only ever drive through while considering it empty.

I can say this from two perspectives. First, I read the book and thouroughly enjoyed it. Second, Dr. Connelly was my professor and advisor at the University of South Carolina from 1986 until 1988. I cannot express enough what an experience it was to sit in one of his classes and listen to his lectures. It was like being transported back in time to the battle or period we were covering that day. The students would wait with anticipation before he arrived and didn't want to leave when the class was over because the transportation back in time would end when we'd leave the classroom.  I remember Dr. Connelly's assessment of Lee quite well. While Lee was a good general, he did tend to be wasteful with resources and has become overrated with time. I strongly encourage the reader of this review to read anything written by Dr. Connelly. He was an amazing man.	2005-10-12

I also was very confused by the early chapter that had Jim Summers and his girlfriend Sophia at a conference.

Downers Grove: IVP, 1971. 142 pages.    Dr. John R.W. Stott was born in London in 1921. Dr. Stott holds a multitude of educational degrees, including French, theology, and various doctorate and honorary doctorates in theology. He has written over thirty books on various theological and religious topics and eight biblical expositions for the Bible Speaks Today commentary series. He has attended All Souls Place (home church) in London since his childhood. He has currently held the position rector emeritus since 1975. He continues to preach at the church several times throughout the year. Billy Graham has stated that Dr. Stott is \\"the most respected clergy man in the world today.\\" One of his earlier publishing's, Basic Christianity, was first written in 1958 and has sold over two and a half million copies and has been translated into more than 63 languages.     Dr. Stott shows the reader that there is much hostility towards the `institution' of the church. It is not that this hostility is geared toward Christ Himself, but against the structure or the organization called `the church' and its fallible managers. The younger generation that is growing up, whether organic to the church or implanted from other religions, is seeking less and less the credentials that make Christianity true and valid.    He feels that many are making too much of the mind knowledge of Christianity and identifying less and less with the actions of Christianity. In essence, it seems he is stating that the culture at large is living a static or nominal Christianity where its participants are just identifiers and not spokesmen. The believers of the movement are only passively wearing the title Christian and not living a life of dynamism for Jesus. You see this by what he calls for in the theme-the return to basic Christianity:     \\"We must commit ourselves, heart and mind, soul and will, home and life, personally and   unreservedly to Jesus Christ. We must humble ourselves before him. We must trust in   him as our Saviour and submit to him as our Lord; and then go on to take our place as loyal members of the church and responsible citizens in the community.\\"     So with this vivid life that humanity is to envelop, Dr. Stott has essentially written a book that is to encapsulate the foundations of what the followers of Christ are to stand firmly upon. His structure is thus centrally based on four movements through his book: (1) Christ's Person: His claims, His character, and His resurrection; (2) Man's Need: The fact and nature of sin and the consequence of sin; (3) Christ's Work: The death of Christ and the salvation of Christ; and lastly, (4) Man's Response: Counting the cost, Reaching a decision, and being a Christian.    Dr. Stott has written the book so that the present culture/generation can learn to hopefully establish themselves in identity with a revolutionary leader, Jesus Christ. If it is the church where this generation sees the hypocrisy, they it is this generation that must respond to the initiative of God by becoming foundational Christians and creating biblical structure within the Church.    \\"Our purpose,\\" Dr. Stott says, \\"is to marshal the evidence to prove that Jesus was the Son of God.\\"  So in section one, the three pillars of evidence concretely set around the person of Jesus-claims, character, and resurrection.     He unfolds through the study of scripture for the reader that there are four different kinds of claims Jesus makes. (1) Jesus teaches in a very `self-centered' manner, yet insists a deep set humility in others; (2) Jesus teaches in `direct' manner concerning his divinity, such as claiming to be the `I am' which identifies himself as the God of the Old Testament; (3) Jesus teaches in a very `indirect' manner concerning his divinity, which is seen through the actions of His ministry-forgives sins, bestows life, teaches as if authority, and claims to eventually judge the world; and lastly, (4) teaches through his `dramatized' claims, which were his supernatural miracles.    Dr. Stott's second pillar of evidence for Jesus is His character, which he divides into four areas. (1) What Christ thought about Himself, especially His identification of being without sin; (2) What Christ's friends said about Him, such as Peter's reference to Jesus as `a lamb without blemish or spot'; (3) What Christ's enemies conceded about Him, such as Pilate's declaration of Jesus being innocent; and lastly, (4) What the contemporary audience can see of Jesus themselves, which in essence consists of the readers validation of the first three items.    The last pillar of evidence for Jesus is His resurrection. Again, Dr. Stott uses a cubed structure to show the strong evidence that Jesus had indeed raised from the dead on that Easter morning. (1) The body was gone from the tomb; (2) The grave clothes were undisturbed; (3) Jesus was actually seen after the resurrection by multitudes of witnesses; and lastly, (4) The disciples were changed-from dark grief to joyous belief.    The second movement of his book speaks about the needs of man. Dr. Stott states that, \\"we must understand who we are as well as who he was.\\"  He emphasizes that Jesus just did not come to the earth in a passive manner, but for a specific purpose...to become `the Saviour of sinners.'   The fact is that all humanity is born into the grasps of sin. There is nothing naturally good to mankind because the reaches of sin are universal. Thus man being destitute to perfection, we need someone to bring us out of this eternal death grip of condemnation and alienation from God.    As Dr. Stott had shown the reader the foundation of Christ's identity; he then moved into showing where all men are as they are born into this world. Man has an immense flaw because of the decisions of human choice. And so understanding that fallible man can not possibly create an infallible solution, Dr. Stott moves into the third movement of his book by showing Jesus' action on the Cross by death and the salvation that is imparted to humanity. As Dr. Stott wrote it so eloquently, \\"Christianity is a rescue religion. It declares that God has taken the initiative in Jesus Christ to deliver us from our sins. This is the main theme of the Bible.\\"     The last section of the book deals specifically with man's response. As mankind understands who they are, sinful creatures, and then they acknowledge the divinity within Jesus, man must make a response to Jesus' death and plan of salvation. Man can only make two decisions to Jesus: reject or accept. There is no neutrality when it comes to religion. Dr. Stott leads the reader through, if it might by systematized, the process of how to come into the realm of Christianity and what it takes to daily live out the Christian existence.    Dr. Stott completes his book by speaking about the Christian's duty to the world. If this generation is rejecting the hypocrites of the institutions, namely the church and the `people', then it is this generation's responsibility to become biblical Christians and rebuild its foundations upon Basic Christianity.    The reviewer believes that Dr. Stott has accomplished his stated objective of calling mankind into action. He clearly stated that the foundations of Christianity were not mere understandings of factual information concerning Jesus, but must be held deeply within what the individual does with the information. He shows the reader that we must do-commit ourselves, humble ourselves, trust and submit to Him, and rightly/loyally take our places among the community of the body.    The reviewer believes that Dr. Stott has lain out a very strong apologetic for dynamic Christianity. This book could most definitely be read by the pagan and quicken them to new life. This book could most definitely be read by the Christian and be quickened to renew their spiritual walk with new power. And most assuredly, what he writes could also hit the disease of nominal Christianity dead in the face. Those that only passively bare the name of Christ could be called into repentance by Dr. Stott's demands of committed Christians. As God Himself is the initiator of all in our reality, so we must be the responders to God's call...either accept or reject.    The reviewer has not read any other books by Dr. Stott in their entirety, but after reading this thoroughly logical and fundamental view of Jesus, there will be many more books digested in the view near future. Dr. Stott is very thought provoking and makes an immense contemporary connection (even though he has been writing for over fifty-one years).	2005-10-12

It isn't until he decides to confront his father and face up to his strained relationship with his own eldest son; that Will discovers the answer and salvation he is looking for has been there all along.  <br /> <br />Cramer illustrates elegantly the fabric of the Amish lifestyle and what it means to turn away from that life. He also tells a touching story of a man's quest for faith, acceptance and forgiveness.  <br /> <br />Will Mullet illustrates for readers the true power of seeing through another's eyes and the forgiveness that God can grant...if we only listen for His still, small voice.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

I found the ideas on spiritual discipline inspiring-and sometimes liberating. Mostly, though, I think this dialog didn't go far enough.  In their conversation, the two main characters, Neo and Dan, agree that we can learn from Asian churches, African churches, Latin churches, and intimate that we can learn from Buddhism and Islam, but I found that even though Neo was Jamaican, the conversation was steeped in an Anglo-American, predominately male worldview. I think this discussion needs to step outside the borders of America and explore how a 'new kind of Christian' should invest a significant part of himself or herself in doing justice and showing compassion not only in America, but in their whole world; not only as a philanthropist, but as a teacher, lawyer, engineer, pastor--whatever their occupation.	2005-10-12

King Alfred ruled Wessex, England 871-899.  His country was in a deplorable educational decline--old monks died before teaching the younger monks how to read Latin, and so a great many works were lost to illiteracy.  England had fallen into a chasm of bitter feuding between warlords after the Romans left in 410.  But most pressingly--the Danes attacked at their leisure--by the thousands--pillaging, raping, and burning.  After his three brothers had succeeded to the throne, and each was killed in battle, Alfred suddenly found himself wearing the crown, commanding a kingdom battered by seemingly inexhaustible enemies and mired in despair.  His resources were terribly low, monetary and otherwise, and yet King Alfred and his loyal army (and navy) won enough battles to force the Danes to make peace--and he even converted the pagan King Guthrum to Christianity.  King Alfred recruited scholars from the continent, he was friends with the grandchildren of Charlemagne, he exhorted his noblemen to read books, he erected forts at strategic points all across the boundaries of Wessex, and he is generally acknowledged as the father of the British Navy.  The man was nothing short of genius.<br /><br />Douglas Woodruff's book brings King Alfred back to life:  The events of his father's reign, the circumstances of Alfred's ascent to the throne, the sense of patriotism he instilled in his subjects, and the after-effects of Alfred's commitment to God and Country--the man's spirit echoed for centuries.  Indeed, England celebrated the 1,000-year anniversaries of both Alfred's birth and death.<br /><br />The author includes maps of Anglo-Saxon England, Anglo-Saxon paintings and drawings, photos of Anglo-Saxon (and Dane) armor, photos of gargantuan drawings carved into hillsides commemorating Alfred's victories (which still exist today), and even photos of Anglo-Saxon jewelry and coins.<br /><br />For either the novice, or the seasoned student of English history, this book will fascinate.history, this book will fascinate.	2005-10-12

Widely used at many American colleges, this book has to provide fundamental building blocks for people going on in mathematics, engineering, computer science, and many related disciplines. Does it succeed?<br /><br />Yes, but with limitations (coming from a math major anyway). This book is a fairly rigorous treatment of calculus, but not from a theoretical standpoint. Stewart is ok at explaining things, but some sections on proofs he is horrendous at explaining the concept (see \\"the precise definition of a limit,\\" among others). On the mechanics of problems, though, he is very good at forcing the reader to learn by repitition, as he includes a high number of problems. Unfortunately he does not include nearly enough examples, and later on this is a TERRIBLE problem in his multivariable calculus text (as I am experiencing right now).<br /><br />Stewart does a good job with about 75 or 80% of the text.<br />rather weak points:<br />section 2.4 (the precise definition of a limit)<br />chapter 6 (applications of integration)<br />9.3-9.5 (further apps of integration)<br />10.5 and 10.7 (diff eq-logistic equation, predator-prey systems(wtf?))<br /><br />Actually it's not all that bad at all. Stewart does an excellent job with the rest of the material, and his inclusion of abbreviated proofs is a welcome thing. This book serves as an introduction for many people to mathematical rigor, so Stewart is smart not to scare people away with long, elegant proofs and such. An abbreviated proof is better than no proof at all, and if you have a good enough professor or you are taking an Honors calc course, you might be treated to the full proofs.<br /><br />A lack of analytic geometry is a big issue as our high schools choose to ignore this subject, and Chapter 11 adresses this fairly competently (although this is treated better in his third-semester book). One chapter of material is not enough for this great subject, but we can't really blame Stewart for that. It's the High School's fault, not his, for failing to prepare us.<br /><br />This was a pretty good book. Although as I view Apostol's book as much more thorough and rigorous, this book serves well as a satisfactory introduction for people who don't need as much rigor. All in all, a slightly above average book, that many people will use.<br /><br />note- chapter 10 (diff eq) and chapter 18 from multivariable (second order diff eq) were particularly well-written (besides the parts of ch10 I mentioned).

Sometimes it's no more than the ability to clearly see what is right in front of everyone's nose, something everyone else misses, or is blind to, or refuses to see.  Belief is a strong thing, perhaps stronger than all other human functions, and we are all working with belief systems we hardly know we habor.  Doherty is having a long hard long look at one of the West's most fiercely held beliefs, to wit: that of all the godmen who were ever worshipped, OUR godman is real.  Not only is Jesus Christ REAL, but he is the only son of God.  What incredible hubris.  It does not serve us to believe this terrible idea.  It never has.  Aside from the destructive pride it instills in our blood, and the crack-brained sense that only we know God, it makes us miss the point of the myth entirely, something no early people ever did.  The followers of Mithras and Osiris and Dionysus knew what their godman stood for.  We haven't a clue what The Christ could have actually taught us and our culture is so much the poorer for it.  Doherty could be that one voice clearing the way to a new and healthier world.  I have nothing but admiration for him.	2005-10-12

I would say that this book is the summation of all his other books, a grand summary of his spiritual and aesthetic career but that would not be accurate.  Let us say, rather, that as Father Death comes for the Good Professor a concentration and consummation of his spiritual aspirations and struggles and his literary powers comes into being.  Bloom has had his game.  He has pontificated about things human and divine, he has sneered at his enemies in the School of REsentment, he has fathered forth readers and writers (such as the eminent Camille Paglia) and now he has to pay the piper. <br /> <br />He describes in this book waking up from nightmares of Yahweh after midnight.  He \\"gloomily and silently\\" walks downstairs where he sips tea, eats black bread, and reads wides swathes of the Tanakh and other Jewish and Christian writings. <br /> <br />For those to whom Bloom is a kind of cultural hero - the heretic Rabbi of all of us rebel readers - a dark cloud gathers over the words of thhis book while we contemplate an endlessly enigmatic Jesus of Nazareth and a catastrophic Yahweh. Bloom returns to his origins in every sense of the term origins.  He has been a Gnostic but now, this late in his and universal history he returns to the Covenant he can never trust and stares at his God and antagonist in the face. <br /> <br />I give this book five stars for Harold Bloom's doom-eager spiritual courage, for the sense of devastation I feel while reading his book, and for a provocation his book contains which is greater than the ages though not, of course, greater than the Ancient of Days.	2005-10-12

He rehashes a lot of already known history of the Knights, which is fine in case some readers are just starting out learning about the Knights, but then he goes pretty much X-files when he adds in extraterrestrials to the mix, then adds other cultural legends into the story of the Knights, which kind of confuses me. I'm all for looking at the Knights from the view of other monotheistic and polytheistic religions around from the time of the Knights, but some seem to be just grasping.     To add to his image as a head honcho Modern Knight, his WIFE is his 'co-knight' (I thought the Knights were supposed to be MONKS and CELIBATE), maintains the present Earl Sinclair is the Fisher King (which I thought was supposed to be attached to the Arthurian legends and not the Knights Templar, and the Fisher King was supposed to be suffering from an unhealable wound), and I think that halfway through the original editing of this book his proofreader/spellchecker either quit or died.    He DOES add some little-known data of the Knights, which is why I won't use the book for kindling, but I was sort of hoping he would have organized the book a little bit better. I learned a bit more about some John the Baptist lore, but ended up confused. I'll try to read through the book again in case I missed something, but I was hoping for a better read.	2005-10-12

The joy in their lives become gifts we share with them as we turn the pages with excitement. <br />I recommend this book for a thinking and feeling person who enjoys reality and learning about relationships that exist in our world.  Our society is so groomed to find pleasure in reading bloody adventures, and space wars we are loosing our grip on the more sensitive subjects in life. <br />Our youth is turning to drugs and other self destructive hobbies instead of learning to feel and think and communicate.

Gross and Levitt are, respectively, scientists trained in biology and mathematics.  They are also broadly-educated individuals who are able to deal with postmodern (and other) challenges to science on those challenges' terms.  They have done considerable homework in preparing to write this book and some of their analyses of postmodern thought are among the most astute and crisp that I have seen.  Moreover, the book is eminently readable.  The style is firm but graceful.  Reading it is not only a pleasure in itself, but a reaffirmation of the possibilities and benefits of broad liberal arts education.  While the issues are current ones, the authorial voice is one of 'old school' erudition informed by deep humanity.<br /><br />There is a danger that the book could be considered a polemic since its rhetoric is very direct.  Punches are not pulled; euphemisms are not substituted.  Nevertheless, while the book provides the pleasures offered by a great polemic it still enjoys the weight and point of serious argument.  It makes its scholarly case.<br /><br />This is must reading for all who work in the humanities and social sciences and seek to understand the assaults to which science has been subjected as well as those assaults' etiology.  The continual question that haunts everyone confronting postmodern thought is, how can serious people believe such stuff?  This book provides a number of plausible answers to that question.	2005-10-12

I had already tried two books on Evo Devo but they were so full of technical details that I couldn't keep track of what I was reading.  Endless Forms leaves out most of what is known about the subject but it says enough for me to grasp the central ideas and it has just enough examples to illustrate its story.  Hence the title of my review.<br /><br />The book is strongest in explaining how genes regulate development, mainly because this is the area where most is known.  Most readers will have heard of hox genes, sonic hedgehog, and a few others.  Carroll gives particular examples of the workings of these genes.  For example, the shoulders of vertebrates form where the areas of expression of certain hox genes meet; in some snakes, one of these genes isn't expressed and so the snakes never form shoulders.  This suggests something about evolution - that these snakes lost their limbs through a change in gene expression - but it doesn't suggest how that change came about.  This is a topic for future research but, unfortunately, Carroll doesn't talk about the fact that evo devo has a lot of work ahead.<br /><br />In a few spots, Carroll loses track of his main theme.  For example, he has a section on the evolution of humans, especially our brains.  This relates a number of important changes, but doesn't relate most of the changes to evo devo.<br /><br />Carroll also says that evo devo provides evidence to refute creationism, but he doesn't back this up.  For example, he outlines the evolution of legs, arms, and wings from lobed fins.  However, as any creationist will be quick to point out, from lobed fins to legs and wings is no big deal; the hard part is getting from a flat-sided fish to one with bony fins.  I wish he had addressed that.  And he should be aware that creationists aren't interested in facts; their only consideration is to save people from the sin of atheism.  If you want to argue against creationism, direct your attention to people who will consider facts.<br /><br />Although I have said that Endless Forms has its minor flaws, I still recommend it for its strength: it gives to us non-specialists a good view of the role of regulatory genes in development and it suggests why this role is significant in evolution<br /><br />[Above written 12 Oct 2005; this added 17 May 2006] Carroll has another book on Evo-Devo, From DNA to Diversity.

This is difficult because only the princess can bring him back and she is loathe to do that because it would give her kingdom to the evil witch. <br /> <br />Card is an multi-talented writer who has spun a superb tale that I could not put down until I read every last page!	2005-10-12

Ophelia Jensen is a small town librarian, hiding from a painful past in Summerset, Iowa.  Ophelia's grandmother, Abby, is a warm hearted, nurturing woman who uses her psychic gifts and the healing arts learned in Appalachia in helpful ways.<br /><br />Ophelia isolates herself and fights against the psychic powers passed down through the generations in her family.  Life has been safe and quiet in Summerville.  Unfortunately for Ophelia, it doesn't stay that way.  Unknown thieves have been stealing<br /><br />anhydrous from surrounding farms.  Then the local newspaper office is trashed.  Finally a handsome stranger shows up at the library masquerading as a chemical salesman. Ophelia dislikes him from first meeting and suspects he isn't what he seems but his attraction to the shy librarian is immediate.  Romance is<br /><br />the last thing on Ophelia's mind.  Odd dreams have been disrupting her sleep, and she finds a corpse while walking in the woods.  Abby warns Ophelia of a hidden danger, tries to keep her safe, but there's only so much white witchcraft can do for an uncooperative subject.  To survive, Ophelia must<br /><br />acknowledge her psychic gifts and use them.<br /><br />Abby and Ophelia are appealing characters who use psychic powers to navigate their way through danger. The small town Iowa locale is ideal.  If you want a different twist in your mysteries, I recommend you give Damsgaard a try.	2005-10-12

Tidbits of real-life epiphanies have made their way from his Dinosaurs in the Attic into his last solo novel The Codex.<br /><br />With four solo efforts taking place in the American Southwest, a 1000 mile horseback trip in the same deserts, and the southwest-based Thunderhead (co-written with Lincoln Child) all under his belt, it was only a matter of time before \\"Hoss\\" Preston returned to archaeology, astronomy, paleontology, geology, and meteors (remember The Ice Limit?); this time, the evidence is found on another celestial body.<br /><br />Tyrannosaur Canyon is 100 pages shorter than this past summer's release Dance of Death and slightly shorter than The Codex. Preston's style, however, promises to deliver, packing a wallop of an adventure story. Expect intricate details interconnecting millions of years--eons of geologic change, a time now petrified--together.  Some of the best chapters are those told by the perspective of a female T. Rex.<br /><br />The plot is metamorphically original and will leave you speechless when you turn the last page.  The body of Preston's novel, however, suffers from an unfortunate lack of intriguing characters, two of whom return from The Codex (although this is not a sequel of sorts).  The bulk of the story is also a chase through the desert; a chase that grows really old, really quickly.  Preston keeps our attention with cutaways to the multiple antagonists (a move Bobby Fischer would be proud of) that threatens the story-line from nearly every possible angle.<br /><br />As a fan of Preston's works, both solo and co-authored, I feel this is an improvement since The Codex.  Alas, it drags on for too long and ends briefly at a point that, were he to extend the last few chapters, would have made one of the best third acts in any book published this year.<br /><br />By the way, probably due to the so-called \\"similar\\" title, Publisher's Weekly compared this book to Crichton, only embarrassing the reviewer in the end. Crichton's and Preston's style have absolutely nothing in common, aside from the \\"written word.\\" Ignore all \\"alter-title references\\" (e.g. \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark meets The Amazing Race\\" - Entertainment Weekly) as this is the most insulting form of praise.

US	16313992	RHTU0UNWNZ2H7	0440212561	983256815	Outlander	Books	5	10	12	N	N	An amazing read	It's so difficult to describe this book -- or the others in the series -- \\"in 250 words or less\\", primarily because it defies labels.  It's romance, historical fiction, adventure, and fantasy, all rolled into one.  Believe me, there's enough here to appeal to a broad audience.  The core of the book is, of course, the characters of Jamie and Claire Fraser, who are perhaps two of the best-drawn characters I've ever read -- they are incredibly real to me, especially after having read the other five books in the series, in which they become steadily more multi-dimensional -- but the cast of secondary characters (some of whom are actual historical figures) and the setting add their own weight to a compelling, provocative story.  There's a lot going on here, and it's not always a fast or easy read.  There are slow moments, although interestingly these moments seem to vary from reader to reader.  The first 50 or so pages were difficult for me, but the pace speeds up considerably once Claire travels through the stones and meets Jamie.  (The time travel element, by the way, is a lot easier to accept than you might believe.  How can you look at Stonehenge, for instance, and think that magic does not exist?  To legitimize her premise of time travel, Gabaldon merely asks you to remember all those moments when you experienced something that could not really be explained.  I have no doubt whatsoever that there are countless readers out there who have, in the past 14 years since Outlander's initial publication, walked through circles of standing stones in Scotland and England, half hoping and half fearing that the magic might take them, too.)  There are scenes in Outlander that can be difficult for a modern reader to appreciate, yet they fit the overall context of the story and add to its integrity.  Diana Gabaldon isn't presenting us with a \\"pretty\\" or superficial historical, and she's not concerned with being PC, so be warned.  There is blood and guts and ruthlessness galore; it's brutal and aggressive and downright uncomfortable at times.  But that's part of what makes it interesting and gripping, especially since those elements exist in conjunction with staggering heroism, love, honor, and sacrifice and Gabaldon's insight into the human psyche. <br /> <br />Gabaldon herself has said that she writes scenes and then ties them together, and anyone who reads her books can understand fairly easily what she means.  There's not always a strong plot (although some of the books have a more definable plot than others, Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber being two of those).  Gabaldon doesn't always present us with a story in which the characters are traversing a rocky path from point A to point B, with victory assured at the end.  But as the saying goes, life is about the journey, not the destination, and that's the focus here as well. Despite the vignette quality of the book -- or perhaps because of it -- there is a fluidity that certainly moves you along, and 600 pages are devoured before you realize it. <br /> <br />Outlander, as a novel, can stand on it's own, but its richness and depth really come alive if you continue with the series and read the remaining books.  Gabaldon is a sneaky writer:  she plugs in all sorts of scenes and persons and events who reappear in later books, and she's a queen of the cliffhanger.  (Plus that time-travel element adds its own conundrum:  Is it possible to change history?  Should one even try?  And if a person born in the 20th century dies in the 18th century, is their life over or are they born again when the centuries catch up?)   It's actually quite astonishing to find yourself reading the sixth book of the series and finding an explanation for something that happened back in book one, and it's that kind of thing that makes the books feel as if they are more real than fictional.   <br />	2005-10-12

His Alex Delaware books, in particular, have not had the same quality they once did, and his contribution to the collaboration (with his wife Faye) Double Homicide was completely forgettable.  His last truly good book was Billy Straight, which featured detective Petra Connor.  With Twisted, he brings her back and once again, writes a good book. <br /> <br />In Twisted, Petra is called in to investigate a drive-by shooting that has left several teenagers dead.  It doesn't seem like a typical gang slaying and most of the leads go nowhere.  This story, however, is merely a subplot.  The main story deals with an intern who she is working with;  this young genius has found that a series of murders have all taken place on the same day, June 28, with enough similarities to not be mere coincidence. <br /> <br />With another June 28 soon approaching, Petra needs to unofficially investigate this serial killing even as she looks into her main case.  Both stories are interesting, but not exactly whodunits; it would be impossible for the reader to figure things out any faster than Petra does. <br /> <br />Why do the Petra Connor stories succeed while the recent Alex Delaware books are hit or miss?  Principally, it's because Petra is a more interesting character and she is surrounded by some decent supporting characters.  Besides Milo Sturgis, there are no real recurring characters of substance in the Delaware books (for many volumes, his girlfriend Robin had little more than a brief cameo for an obligatory sex scene).  Perhaps writing in the third person helps Kellerman with his characterization (and in fact, the best recent Delaware book - The Murder Book - is around 50% third person). <br /> <br />Whatever the case, Twisted is a reminder that Kellerman still can write a good novel.  Current Kellerman fans should be pleased with this effort, and those new to this writer will not be disappointed.   <br />	2005-10-12

Los Angeles occupies such a large place in American popular culture and myth that stories of its surroundings tend to be overshadowed -- but with these marvelous stories, the reader is offered a dramatic view of one such place. About 12 miles east of downtown LA, El Monte is a largely Hispanic community of 115,000 people clustered around the intersection of the 5 and 605 and Southern Pacific railway. Like Oscar Casares' excellent stories about Hispanic-American Texas in Brownsville and and Sandro Meallet's great debut novel Edgewater Angels, about the San Pedro area of LA, Jamie-Becerra has captured the everyday people and everyday dramas of El Monte with great skill, subtlety, and heart. Unfortunately, the book seem to have been missed by the general public and consigned to the Hispanic-lit ghetto, which is a big shame.<br /><br />The stories are mostly set in 1984-89, with one diversion back to 1956, and one story which switches back and forth between the late 1989 and 1940s. Characters come and go throughout the stories, and it takes a very good memory to keep track of them all -- I'll try to make most of the connections here. The possible linchpin (if there is one), is an auto repair shop run by an old Anglo named Georgie. The fifth story, \\"Georgie and Wanda\\" goes back to 1956 to tell about Georgie's career as a stock-car driver and wooing of the Mexican beauty queen who becomes his wife. One of Georgie's mechanics at the garage is the subject of the third story, \\"The Corrido of Hector Cruz\\". Set in 1984, it's one of the more social-realist stories, as the hardworking man and his pregnant wife Mini are suddenly faced with providing a home for their nephew Lencho, who is coming out of juvenile detention. Five years after getting a job at Georgie's garage with his uncle, Lencho is the focus of the sixth story, \\"Riding with Lencho.\\" Fellow mechanic Manny narrates, as he and Lencho take a road trip to the Baja coast to take a break from Lencho's problems with his girlfriend Josie. Hector and Mini come back in the last story, \\"Buena Suerte Airlines\\", another social-realist story focusing on the couple's money problems and Mini's decision to go back to work at McDonald's.<br /><br />Another set of interrelated people include teenage Gina and her boyfriend Max who are introduced in the slight 1987 story \\"Practice Tattoos,\\" narrated by Gina's little brother. The couple reappears two years later in \\"Gina and Max\\", as they take a bus crosstown to go to a Christmas party thrown by Max's friend Benny. This Benny turns out to be a rather dark and nasty dude who runs with some cholos, and the party takes a rather uncomfortable turn. However, Benny's better side can be seen in \\"La Fiesta Brava\\", also set in 1989. This story is mostly about Guillermo, his electronics repairman father, and his godmother Marta. However, when bullies come looking for Guillermo, Marta's boyfriend Benny gets involved with rather surprising results.<br /><br />One of the best stories is \\"Every Night is Ladies Night\\", about an ice-cream truck lady named Lily. A single mother, she lives with her tia Ruby, and embarks on a sweet romance with her boss. One of their dates is at a party thrown by Oscar's cousin Lupe and his girlfriend Evelyn. The story of their impending marriage and Evelyn's long absent grandfather is the basis of \\"Lopez Trucking Incorporated.\\" Lily's Tia Ruby is the subject of a quest in what most will regard as the shining star of the collection, \\"Media Vuelta\\", a story about an elderly mariachi player who makes his first trip to the U.S. after his wife dies. With nothing else to live for, he's trying to track down the girl he loved as a youth and lost. With limited funds and no English, he makeshis way to El Monte, where, with the sketchy help of Lencho, tracks Ruby down.<br /><br />Jaime-Becerra is a huge talent, vividly portraying the little dramas and oddities of daily life in Hispanic Southern California. At the same time he captures something of what it means to be part of the working poor in this country, and the struggle to stay out of poverty. The stories are determinedly multigenerational and the first person narration draws the reader into the family lives of his characters. The language is dead on (although those without any Spanish, such as myself, may miss a few lines here or there that are rendered in Spanish), and he's got a nice eye for description. This is a first-class debut, and I can't wait to read more from him.e makes his way to El Monte, where, with the sketchy help of Lencho, tracks Ruby down.  <br /> <br />Jaime-Becerra is a huge talent, vividly portraying the little dramas and oddities of daily life in Hispanic Southern California.

I finally did it -- after watching all three of the movies, I finally read Harry Potter, Books 1 and 2! And I'm glad I did. The movies are awesome, but the books are even better. There's a whole level of hilarious humor in Rowling's writing that just doesn't make it into the film versions of Harry Potter. Because of the time crunch, numerous scenes from the book never make it onto the big screen. If you've seen the movies and think you've seen it all, you're in for a big surprise when, like me, you finally get around to cracking the books open to really enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Rowlings is simply brilliant. She writes in a style that appeals to all ages. I enjoy how she gauges time by the school year and its associated seasons. Her vivid descriptions appeal to all the senses; you can \\"taste\\" the sweet custard or \\"feel\\" the coldness of a passing ghost. When things get intense, she lightens things up with a hilariously funny episode -- often something happening to Harry or Ron. When you're lulled into thinking things will be routine for a while, something leaps out of the pages to turn everything upside down.<br /><br />The characters, of course, are magnificent. Ron always gets to say what everyone else only dares to think. Without Hermione's brains I think all of Hogwarts would simply fall apart (or blow up)! And Harry, the reluctant hero, is remarkably human, never seeking the spotlight but always finding himself in the center of things, always having to face and conquer his biggest fears. We can see ourselves and our friends quite clearly in this trio. The rest of the cast, from wise wizards to eccentric teachers, brings color and fun to the text.<br /><br />If you like a good book, read Harry Potter 1. Once you're done, you'll undoubtedly find yourself picking up Harry Potter 2 immediately. The second book is just as fantastic as the first. I'm ready to start Book 3 ... if I hurry, I just might get through Book 4 before the fourth movie comes out!<br /><br />--Graciela Sholander, [...]<br />--Graciela Sholander, [...] <br />	2005-10-12

Hall's book is the odyssey of one man's experience with the American VA system, and reflects the (sadly) all too often heard complaints and dissatisfaction of so many Veterans.<br /><br />Larry hasn't written a work of art, but by relating his story he certainly has written a work of heart! I winced somewhat at the lack of technical writing expertise but much more so at the \\"treatment\\" that the VA bureaucracy doled out to him - one of those to whom they owe their existance.<br /><br />This is a book that will trigger anger at the \\"system\\" in all those who read it, harden the resolve of Veterans' Advocates, and may increase the sense of helplessness in Veterans who are striving on their own for their entitled compensation.<br /><br />For those in the latter category, the lesson that Larry's book provides is very important; giving up is playing into the hands of the system.

I am glad to have read it, for I now understand much better the evolution of the current reasoning on the subject of global warming.  However, as an engineer used to dealing with hard data, I was disappointed in what it did not cover.  The whole point of this controversy is whether or not the \\"global average temperature\\" has gone up a degree or so in the last hundred years, and whether this trend is accelerating because of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  Yet, the term \\"global average temperature\\" is never really defined in terms of how it is measured currently.  The book does not explain why the increase in carbon dioxide does not prevent the heat from the sun from arriving at the earth's surface and therefore cause cooling!  Charts are presented showing temperature variations going back a thousand years or more, yet the calibrated thermometer was only developed in the early 1700's.  I don't know whether global warming is occurring or not, but I am very suspicious that it is an elegant theory, based on very sophisticated computer models,  that is not backed up by enough hard data.  How many and where were temperature data points  taken 100 years ago?  The book does not reveal these important facts, and I wonder if it is not because the basis is so flimsy that the proponents do not want it to be known.	2005-10-12

Therefore, we need a book like this for constant reference. <br />     HOWEVER, and this is for Mr. Sharp: I held short on giving this book 5 stars because what we really need is for someone to write a lexicon which also includes the Latin and Greek and French and German phrases that Jung scatters throughout his work.

It is sad how often so many of us assume a diminishing capacity for love and sexual pleasure is inevitable, and acquiesce to an insidious internal process that robs us of one of life's greatest pleasures. Sex and Love in Intimate Relationships resoundly demonstrates that we can maintain a healthy sexuality throughout our lifetimes, if we understand and confront the real internal obstacles to ongoing sexual fulfillment. <br /> <br /> This book provides an important answer to the great mystery concerning sexuality in America: why is that despite a tidal wave of Dr. Phil-type experts and Mars and Venus books, Americans seem to be having less and less sex?  <br /> <br /> Sex and Love in Intimate Relationships reports, for example, that a 1994 survey of 7000 couples reported that 59% of men and 63% of women said they were not emotionally satisfied in their sexual relationships. Other surveys indicate that most couples, particularly as people get older, have sex just once or twice a month. Why do people have sex so infrequently, despite the growing mountain of  books, video tapes and workshops promising new vistas of sexual adventure and ecstasy? <br />  <br /> The answer, if one believes Sex and Love in Intimate Relationships, is that most our real sexual problems derive fgrom deep inner psychological defenses that are untouched by the superficial focus on technique offered by most sex experts. It is fine to prescribe telling your partner what you like, wearing pink nighties or making love in a phone booth. But unless we dare tackle the deep inner causes of sexual dissatisfaction, such outer prescriptions rarely offering lasting results.  <br /> <br /> Sex and Love in Intimate Relationships describes in detail, using interesting case-histories, how people have internalized \\"voices\\" or negative thoughts about their capacity for love, bodies, partners and performance which, over time, diminish their capacity for sexual pleasure. We also struggle with deep unconscious fears of death which distance us from our partners, as allowing ourselves real sexual intimacy means opening ourselves up to the deep pain of losing them.  <br /> <br /> But the book also offers hope. The book offers numerous case-histories demonstrating that people can, by understanding and countering the inner causes of diminishing sexuality, expand their capacity for love, intimacy and sexual pleasure. Dozens of couples have used the ideas in this book to increase their capacity for sexual fulfillment and the actions they have taken, though requiring facing childhood hurts, can be taken by anyone. I strongly recommend reading this book and, more importantly of course, acting upon its prescriptions.   <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

Namely, Stephanos' wedding to Philomena. It provides an excuse for our laconic sleuth to muse in a post-drunken wedding binge that someone might have chucked a sharp knife at him. In turn, this enables him, post-nuptials, to start to think about things other than the sorry state of his interior and exterior dcor, symposiums and solving the odd magpie inspired theft here and there that have not gripped our attention up to this point.   <br />Doody's slow inexorable plot style drags the unwilling reader along again so that by page two hundred or so of the paperback version we find ourselves wondering exactly what task Stephanos and Aristotle are being set by the author other than responding to a trumped-up charge of boundary poaching by the neighbour of his newly extended family. However, lurking furtively in the background is the murder of the helpful Sophilios and, also, Arhkias' disclaimer over the amount of drakhmai he lost in the incident. <br />Doody has Philomela express a desire to join the mysteries of Eleusis and this coincides with Aristotle's slave, for whom his affection grows daily. As the novel progresses we find ourselves bombarded with more and more problems and the clue to it all lies in exactly the fact there is an inundation. Stephanos' stumbles alarmingly through his Eleusian initiation, gets overly raucous in the Agora as he's accused of not fulfilling his previous nuptial agreements, finds himself on the receiving end of a knife thrower and a marble head a few times, up on his own tiles and generally harassed left right and centre as he tries to deal with a spurious land ownership charge by Lykon and locate missing children. <br />By the time we reach our denouement in a pottery shop where we get a quick rash of murders based on the fallings out of a criminal gang, Doody neatly ties up the thievery with Stephano's beleaguered life and we come away satisified that out of the murky randomness was actually a very clever plot. I have to say that I have found the Stephanos mysteries extremely laborious to plow through but this is by far the best so long as you keep gong past page two hundred. It'll be interesting to see if Stephanos continues to improve.	2005-10-12
US	12883027	R28LIUD27ZBO14	1556525710	524334940	A Few Kind Words and a Loaded Gun: The Autobiography of a Career Criminal	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Rock'n'Roll Hellrazor	South Londoner Noel \\"Razor\\" Smith's long history of crime culminated as a member of \\"The Laughing Bank Robbers\\", an armed firm known for their \\"gallows humour\\" who cracked jokes while collecting their loot - even, on one job, dressing in festive Santa hats and wishing terrified customers and staff a \\"Merry Christmas\\". Smith was also part of the Rockabilly scene who with his gang the Balham Wildkatz battled it out with punks, skinheads and other rivals at a time when the various London subcultures were tearing into each other at every opportunity with boots, fists, and whatever else was handy. <br /> <br />\\"A Few Kind Words...\\" stands head and shoulders above most crime memoirs. Firstly, it is not ghostwritten - Smith discovered a talent for writing whilst behind bars that eventually got him published in national newspapers. Secondly, prison is where he is right now, serving a life sentence (or technically speaking, eight of them). So let's just say that, on top of being extremely well-written, this book has an edge over much of its 'Real Crime' contemporaries in what can often be quite a tacky and superficial run-of-the-mill genre. <br /> <br />Smith loads his memoir with enough raucous mayhem to more-than-satisfy on the entertainment front, but also often pauses for  intelligent, analytical reflections on the workings of his own criminal mind, and the life he has spent \\"fashioning the chains that now bind him\\". Through writing, he says, he has \\"found a more acceptable way of expressing himself\\" than via the violence and crime that has taken away his most basic human right: freedom.  <br /> <br />Born in 1960 into an average Irish working-class family, Smith has none of the usual excuses of a broken home or violent abuse to account for his slip down the wrong tracks, and to his credit, insists it was entirely his own choice, something he walked into with eyes wide open to the consequences. Yet, in his exploration of the past, he interestingly cites an adolescent experience of unprovoked \\"torture\\" and forced false-confession at the hands of drunken police as a turning-point in his attitude towards \\"the system\\", sparking a rebellious spirit that - who knows - may not have otherwise been there, or atleast come so prominently to the fore. He also explains what it was like during the 70s when, with the IRA's bombing campaign at its height and anti-Irishness rife, London-Irish kids were often compelled to either feign Englishness or assert their own identity, sometimes physically.      <br /> <br />Though such factors alone can hardly take the blame for the self-destructive one-man crimewave that Smith became, it does suggest how he would have felt the kind of outsider status that can often can lead in a lawless direction. However, with Smith's addiction to the power and adrenaline of armed robbery (\\"It was a rush that no amount of cocaine or Ecstasy could imitate\\") it is hard to imagine anything other than  participation in an actual war (Smith's own suggestion, by the way) satiating such an overwhelming urge. <br /> <br />Smith gets great pleasure in considering himself one of the last London \\"Chaps\\", criminals who followed codes of conduct and honour taken from noir gangster films and westerns. Here he paints all the usual mythical pictures of gangsters who were honest, moral and fair (as opposed to the modern stereotypical urban criminal, cracked-up to the eyeballs, and would kill his own granny for a tenner). But in wild contradiction, he also describes himself as \\"a thug from a council estate\\" who admits to acts of violence that were \\"vicious and heinous\\" - such as his penchant for slashing faces, presumably - hence the nickname. (The book actually ends in a statement of show-off criminal no-value that defies the writing's overall intelligence.)   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, Smith generally paints himself as human rather than hero (he doesn't always win - he often quite brutally loses), and he writes with an awareness that, dueto his endless weakness for tempers, tantrums and slashings, he is not exactly endearing himself to the reader. But that is a winning ingredient, because in a crime memoir the down-to-earth honesty and lack of excuses makes a real change. <br /> <br />Mirroring Smith's life, much of the book is set in prison - in fact, Smith brings us on a tour of practically every prison in southern England. In these chapters he rails against what he sees as \\"holiday-camp\\" depictions in the British tabloid press where prisoners are treated with kid gloves and a revolving-door policy operates. Conversely, Smith runs through the many bad conditions, brutalities, injustices and corruption he has witnessed - which is enlightening but, of course, depressing.  <br /> <br />Smith's endless revisits, after umpteen chances of freedom, may leave you exasperated and out of patience - Razor's life reads like a long prison sheet punctuated only by occasional bouts of freedom. But crime was evidently what he thrived on, his reason for living, and no amount of jail - despite its harshness - could quash his desire to keep going back to \\"the business\\" for more. Ultimately, in the book (until a massive life sentence in '99) he's springing back and forth like a yo-yo. <br /> <br />Of course, towards the end there are a few moments of regret (how could there not be?) but there's also a strong lingering sense of defiance (check out the last few paragraphs) that is quite startling. You're left remembering the zeal - an almost heady nostalgia - in which Razor Smith recounts his robberies, gangfights and prison escapes that leaves you wondering if given the chance he'd do it all again.	2005-10-12

Not everyone is happy about Angel's book, which is about the murder of a debutante, Bethany Banks, including the victim's sister who interrupts Angels' speech. Someone then tries to run Angel over and shortly after that she disappears. Pen, along with the ghost of Jack Shepard, a private eye who was murdered over fifty years ago, are investigating angel's disappearance when Pen stumbles over a body that turns out to be that of Bethany's sister. Is there a serial killer on the loose?<br /><br />I love this mystery series. The relationship between Jack Shepard, the ghost of a hard-boiled detective and Penelope, a modern day widow, are what makes the book work. Alice Kimberly deftly weaves one of Jack's old cases with the modern one, writing Jack's case using the jargon of hard-boiled detective literature and Pen's case in modern day language. It's particularly amusing as Jack explains the jargon used in his time and Pen tells him about modern day conveniences such as cell phones and who people such as John F. Kennedy, Jr. were. Readers will chuckle, perhaps uneasily, as Jack wonders why anyone would buy bottled water. Not too many authors could write believably about the attraction between a live person and a ghost, but Kimberly does it beautifully.<br /><br />The mystery itself is reminiscent of the Kennedy-Skakel case with plenty of suspects and twists and turns. The identity of the murderer will come as a surprise to many readers but is believable. Kimberly throws in a nice way of Jack being able to leave the bookstore to help solve the mystery, which is great, because it allows the characters to interact and sole mysteries in several locations rather than be confined to the bookstore.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and the entire series.	2005-10-12

The group of scientists that are described are very real, some of them likeable and some of them less so! But the other thing I liked about this book was that it gave me a real feel for an age, a time of enlightenment not just in science but in EVERYTHING!

While transformation or redevelopment will be possible in some cases, many small churches face the real possibility of closure in their near future.  Sadly, there is very little helpful guidance for these churches, their leaders, and their pastors as they confront this reality.  This book stands in this breach.  It provides insight from pastors, denominational leaders, and in-depth reasearch on how congregations can put closure on the table as a potential HEALTHY option for struggling churches.  Instead of seeing closure as defeat, failure, or disgrace the authors in this anthology suggest that closing may, in fact, release a congregation's gifted members, spiritual heritage, and real assests for new ministry and new life for all involved.  Highly recommended for congregational leaders or for denominational staff working with congregations facing issues of long-term viability.	2005-10-12

I thought her assumptions were interesting though incorrect.  Since I did read the book here is my review of it. <br /> <br />This System tackles an interesting challenge.  How can you pick up a girl, have sex with her, yet do it in a respectful way.  I like this book because it's the only pick up book that I've read that actually shows you both sides of the coin.  Women are not featured as targets or victims.  They are featured as powerful and intellectual individuals who are capable of making decisions about their own sexuality. <br /> <br />At some points of the book I was surprised at Valentine's candid approach.  It's the only pick up book that I've read where the author said  <br /> <br />\\"I never lie to women!  There's never a reason to.  When you lie, you have put the burden of the relationship and her feelings and her life on your back.  Don't lie, tell her the truth.\\" <br /> <br />In many ways, this book goes way beyond pick up techniques and teaches the psychology of interpersonal relationship between men and women.  Men are advised and taught how to understand \\"the mental game\\" before even trying to approach a woman. <br /> <br />I also found the body language approach to be compelling.  We all know that 80% to 90% of all human communication happens non-verbally (body language).  From the initial eye contact to sleeping with a woman to follow up (believe it or not Valentine discourages one-night-stands), the author shows how to read every move a woman makes so you are always at least one step ahead of her.  He expresses that the ability to read women body language gives you the power to determine if and when you would like to take her home. <br /> <br />The book also discourages \\"pick up lines\\".  It actually teaches us how seduce women by establishing a connection with them verbally.  It teaches you how to have conversations with women that will make you more interesting to her.  Any communication or psychology professional will recognize the theory of 100% communication in this book.  Non-verbal + verbal = 100% communication.  The book teaches how to achieve this level of connection and how to use it to have sexual relationships with women. <br /> <br />The book is only 208 pages and at the end you have a feeling of wanting more.  After reading it (less than 2 hrs) I felt like I had just crammed a human relationship class, a sex 101 class, a sociology class, a psychology class, a male and female sexuality class, and a communications class.  I felt like I understood how all these schools of knowledge interact together (I was a good student but I think I missed the link between all these things while in college). <br /> <br />I recommend this book highly to both men and women.  I think it has essential information for single men trying to meet someone.  I think it's also critical for women who would like a better understanding of themselves in a social environment and in relationships.	2005-10-12

I am a die hard fan of Firefly and, as such, I grabbed this book as soon as I heard about it. The cancellation of the show left me wanting more. Essays dissecting the show? What the heck. Could be fun.    But, by and large, it isn't.    The book starts off promising enough. There is an essay that talks about the look and feel of the show from a filmmaking point of view, and that's pretty cool. Also interesting is the examination of the episode \\"Objects in Space\\" (my personal favorite) as an exercise in existentialism.    Unfortunately, the handful of insightful essays/articles do not offset the rest of the book. Most of the book reads like a fanzine (a fan-produced, fan-edited, usually low-quality collection of articles that are insightful and witty to only the most diehard fans). Chief among these were the silly \\"The Rise and Fall (and Rise) of Firefly,\\" and the dreadfully un-funny and irrelevent \\"Firefly vs. The Tick.\\" Many of the essays are guilty of simply overanalyzing the show to death. Yes, you can pick at the parts fo Firefly (the western part, the sci-fi part...) and find lots of flaws--but what none of the essays seem to point out is that it's the sum of the parts that makes this show such a wonderful thing.    Perhaps the worst of the bunch is \\"I Want Your Sex...\\" a seemingly endless man-hating rant by an irate Buffy fan that berates Joss Whedon for not taking the initiative to make the Firefly universe a matriarchal society where women wield all of the power and men are simply window dressing. The characters of Firefly--ALL of them--are strong characters, stronger than those on most shows on television today. To say that the women of this show were marginalized and weak is just plain silly. Everyone who's ever watched the show KNOWS Zoe could kick everyone's [back] on that ship and take command. The fact that she choses NOT to do so (as my wife points out) shows STRENGTH not weakness. The fact that she is devoted to and dotes on her husband is not a weakness (as the writer of the essay would have you believe) but a personal choice. The fact River is not interested in relationships with men on the ship (or off the ship) doesn't maker her character sexless--it doesn't make her ANYTHING. It just is. The girl has other priorities. She's a fugitive, after all...    I'll stop ranting now.    Anyway, if you're looking to supplement your Serenity movie experience, buy the Firefly DVDs, the novel, and the making-of book. (Skip the first step if you already own the DVDs.) As for this book--the few bright spots are hardly worth the price of admission.	2005-10-12

Whereas 'Grassroots' is for those who need help writing sentences and with more basic grammar concepts, the 'Evergreen' book is for those who have mastered that level of writing, and are ready to develop more fully structured themes and essays.<br /><br />The first unit of 'Evergreen' reviews the basic concepts of the writing process - what is one writing for? Who is the likely or intended audience? How should a finished paper look? Believe it or not, it is on this last point that so many grades have risen or fallen - a paper can be wonderfully written, but if it is scribbled on scrap paper rather than typewritten and neatly printed, it may suffer in grading, just as a letter from a business will not be as well received if it has spelling errors and problems with formatting.  (This is a similar introduction to the 'Grassroots' text.)<br /><br />The second unit looks for explicitly at the paragraph, developing concepts such as coherence, topic sentences, ideas to include and exclude, as well as outlining and revising.<br /><br />The third and fourth units in this book are really the heart of the writing process.  In the development of the paragraph, there are different approaches and techniques one can take - the paragraph can be descriptive, narrative, explanatory of a definition, comparison and contrast, persuasive, and a few other means.  These lead naturally into the development of the essay, which is generally a series of paragraphs that are linked by a common idea or theme - some of the same processes that go into the development of a paragraph parallel the development of an essay, and many of the same descriptors above apply to paragraph forms, too.  The fifth unit extends this kind of essay development by exploring sentence variety, language awareness and consistency in the revision process.<br /><br />Units 6 and 7 are review chapters for grammar concepts, punctuation, and spelling.  These are really review areas - they do not go into enough depth or repetition for this to be an introductory text, but rather will assume some familiarity with the concepts being presented.<br /><br />The final section has a collection of reading selections, some from well-known authors and other figures.  There are pieces that provide examples for the different kinds of essays described earlier in the book - some pieces are narrative, some are persuasive, some are humourous.<br /><br />This is a good book to use to become a better writer.

I grew up watching her on \\"Singled Out\\" and other shows and I love how crude she is.  (That's just my personality).  So you can only imagine how excited I was to receive my copy of \\"Belly Laughs\\" in the mail.  My son was already 1 year old before I actually bought the book so I wasn't actually pregnant when I read it but I wanted to read it none the less - because Jenny wrote it. <br /> <br />I can't even describe how hard it was to get into this book.  First of all - I could have wrote this book.  I am no literary princess or anything and I guess I wasn't expecting Jenny to be either - but for Pete's sake.

I know not everyone is as lucky as I am but is there really a woman who has ALL the pregnancy symptoms happen to them - apparently Jenny is!!  I, like a lot of the other readers, got tired of the constant complaining and whining about EVERYTHING.

American capitalism have brought us universalized fashion and half-done cuisine that may hearken to that of another culture, but lacks the quality of the genuine article.  World music is played all over the air waves now, and it enters the music market through the soundtracks of films we have all seen.  Through the Western market, we become what we are not by identifying ourselves with what we never were by consuming what we will.  We are told we can remake ourselves on a whim, merely by accessorizing.  We have become \\"a little bit of everything\\" and a whole lot of nothing specific, as individuals.  Why?  Partly because we are told that diversity is a virtue--and it is.  But in order to sustain diversity, we must remain distinctly what we are.  In order to be tolerant, we must be exposed to something with which we disagree, something we must tolerate.<br /><br />Maintaining personal distinction in a world that fights to assimilate us is the sort of thing that Marsden has advocated in \\"The Outrageous Idea of Christian Scholarship.\\"  This book is not merely for Christians, it is for everyone.  Marsden has chosen to focus on Christian scholarship because he is a Christian, but he advocates an academic milieu in which Buddhists and Muslims and Jews--and anyone else who has a distinct perspective--are essential voices in discussions that have bearing on how this society will be run.  One thing is sure: Marsden is calling for an end to the secularist monopoly in academic circles.  It is time for us to learn what true diversity looks like.  It is time for us to act with true tolerance.  It is time to stop being cast in a universal, one-size-fits-all mental mold, and become the people we are in private, in public.<br /><br />ALong	2005-10-12

I am a 45-year-old female, former cancer patient who gained weight after treatment was finished and my thyroid died on me! Also, I used to work for a national weight loss center, so I have some experience in that \\"industry\\", (which is a very lucrative one!) <br /> <br /> A good detox sounded about right to me, given my circumstances! I lost 15 pounds in two weeks on this detoxification diet, and have lost an additional 4 lbs the following two weeks!  I am happy with that to date, as I am hypothyroid and am not supposed to be able to lose any weight. <br /> <br />The fatty acid supplements recommended have caused my blood pressure to drop dramatically, eliminating the need for all BP meds!  I have not used the recipes per se (busy soccer mom!), except for the berry smoothies, and I am still losing weight and feel SO much healthier with a clearer mind! <br /> <br />It is good to buy the cookbook as well as the original book, because it contains an updated section with changes to the diet at the very beginning of the book!  In other words, you will miss out on the diet updates (based on the latest research) if you DON'T buy the cookbook!  I did not buy her own supplements, as I've been able to buy similar ones for much less, and they seem to be working fine.  Try Googling - Health Plus Inc. \\"Fireball Sports Nutrition Fat Burner\\" and also their \\"Liver Cleanse\\". <br /> <br />My family doctor saw me after I was on the diet for two weeks and immediately asked me what I had done to myself - that I looked so much better than when she saw me the month before. She noticed how much clearer my thought processes were, and said I was speaking faster and more clearly.  My hair is getting thicker, my joint pain is nearly completely gone and I'm off all arthritis medicine, AND my mind works better! My skin is much softer and smoother as well.  My doctor wants to read the book - she was so impressed! <br /> <br />Even if I don't lose another pound (which I doubt would happen!) I willstick with the principals and regime, because I FEEL so much better!!!  <br />  <br />The diet takes a bit of getting used to the first week, but quickly becomes memorized habit, so just work your way through that first week of confusion and you should be fine!  It's takes a bit of prep work, what with tracking down all the supplements and getting your food cabinet ready etc.  If you don't have a health food store near you (and you will need a good one!) you can purchase everything online! <br /> <br />FYI - my MD agreed with the general claims Ms. Gittleman makes for the supplements.  There is also an extensive bibliography with the various studies cited.  Every recommendation in this book has extensive research to back it up, so that is another thing worth mentioning!  This isn't just a \\"eat-all-the-bacon, steak-and-eggs-you-want\\" weight-loss plan! <br /> <br />To close, I am very happy with the program, and feel it is one of the most researched, and well-documented eating plans I have ever seen.  Not the easiest initially, but nothing worth its weight (no pun intended!) ever is!  The fact that it DETOXIFIES is a huge bonus as well!	2005-10-12

It attempts to develop evidence to support the author's conclusion that the operations of al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden are really extensions of U.S. geo-political strategy to dominate the Central Asian Republics and to control the petroleum reserves of the Near East. Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed has accumulated a good deal data in support of his arguments, but has done so very selectively ignoring  large amounts of equally relevant data that does not support his conclusions. Further, Ahmed  has a rather idiosyncratic interpretation of the data he has selected which not all readers would agree with. He also attributes a higher level of focus and competence to the American Government than I think the evidence will support. In short this book presents a well written, well documented, but highly implausible  conspiracy theory. An objective review of all the data relevant to al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden will demonstrate, I think, that the global Islamic terrorist movement is not the witting or unwitting tool of U.S. Global Strategy.<br /><br />Yet I gave the book four stars. The U.S. Government has absolutely failed to regain the credibility it lost as the result of the Vietnam War and its aftermath so it is important that books like this continue to be written to call into question the motives and intentions of its officials. An open mind is the best path to clear thinking.	2005-10-12

Heart-rending, heart-breaking, filled with fury and indignation, love and the hope of reconciliation, political diatribe and aesthetic redemption, \\"Shalimar\\" reads like no other contemporary work.  Passages of marvelous beauty (particularly of the early love between Shalimar and Boonyi, two of the novel's central characters), of the triumph of art over ideology (particularly Bombur Yambarzal's humorous and heroic deflation of the humorless and despicable mullah, Bulbul Fakh), and of the unmitigated horrors of war (particularly the destruction of the once near-utopian village of Pachigam, perhaps one of the most tragic passages in modern literature) confront readers at nearly every turn.  This is one of the most densely populated (in the sense of characterization as well as ideas) novels of recent years, perhaps even more apocalyptically epic in scope than Rushdie's own \\"Midnight's Children.\\"  Most important of all, Rushdie proves (once again) that politics and literature can be mutually enriching as well as informative; that art can teach more profoundly than any ideology (religious or political); and that hope and beauty--in the midst of the very worst of human-made atrocities-- will find a way (sometimes) to persevere.  This is a difficult, angry novel; but make no mistake, it will reward the patient (and thoughtful) reader with a profoundly moving experience.  Indeed, Rushdie reminds us all why the novel remains one of the most pertinent and potent of today's artistic venues.	2005-10-12

I like the books... Unlike most techies, I like the humor contained within.  One thing about techno-dummie books is that they generally give you just enough information to get up and running... They're great starting points.  However, you will not learn standarized methods, as proposed by the W3C, from this book.  You'll learn about selectors, but things like the box model are not really explained as well as they should be.<br /><br />THIS BOOK IS GEARED TOWARDS IE BROWSERS ONLY - as the author states several times throughout.  In regards to marketing, MS owning 90% market share, it makes sense to teach from this angle.  But to learn the full potential of the language I can't see the justification.  Firefox, Opera, and Safari, already support alot of selctors from CSS Level 3, leaving the IE viewers a degraded or dimished view of pages created to standard.  It's possible that IE may take advantage of these things in the future, hopefully, and you won't learn what CSS truly has to offer in the dummies books.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend looking at WROX CSS books such as \\"Professional CSS...\\" and \\"Accessible XHTML and CSS Web Sites Problem Design Solution\\" after reading this book.  Other good books would be Jeremy Keith's \\"DOM Scripting...\\", which is geared towards CSS guys, and Dan Cederhom's \\"Bulletproof Web Design...\\"<br /><br />That being said, the Dummies book, in my opinion is the easiest starting point... just be prepared to do more reading.... lots more.	2005-10-12

Written by the same author who brought you such acclaimed volumes as How to Get Into Law School and Sex and Power, this is an important book for an election that looms just over the horizon--and it will absolutely give readers a new lens through which one can consider Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Within the pages of Uncle Shelby's ABZ book lies the superb and imaginative work Silverstein puts into his better known \\"children's\\" poetry books combined with a deeply warped sense of humor.  The result is a work that's marvelously funny, albeit just a tad disturbing.  With tongue firmly in cheek, Uncle Shelby innocently suggests to children who might be reading, among other things, to throw eggs at the ceiling, bury their little sister in a deep hole, take a ride in a kidnapper's fast car (after telling him your daddy has lots of money) or smashing the TV with a hammer to set free the elves that live within.  (\\"What will you name them?\\" asks Uncle Shelby). <br /> <br />Short, yet entertaining from cover to cover, Uncle Shelby's ABZ book belongs on the coffee table of anyone wanting easy access to bent humor thinly disguised as naivety.

It combined a mystery that kept me turning the pages and it led me into a labyrinth of twisted characters who were by turns fascinating, horrible, pitiful, charming and wholly believable.  The villian, if he is a villian, was clearly deluded and evil, but he was also appealing -- a broken-hearted genius who took a tragic turn.  The hero, if he is the hero, is also sympathetic, as well as charming and attractive.  At the same time, his inability to come to turns with his own inner demons make him frustrating and not always likable.  I loved the way the whole thing came together in the end and I especially liked the touches of South American shamanic medicine.  Did what I think happened at the end really happen at all?  I don't even mind that I'm not sure.  Highly recommended.	2005-10-12

Having listened to dozens of books on CD, I can say that this was clearly the worst presentation of a book on CD I've even encountered.  The reader's attempts to imitate the voice of every speaking character are weak.  He randomly vascillates from whispering to shouting.  He reads much too fast at times and blurs his words.  He provides absolutely no clue as to where you are in the book -- no chapter names or numberings, not even so much as a \\"This concludes Disc 4\\" -- so when you get to the end of the disc, you immediately start hearing -- without warning -- something from an hour ago that was on track 1 of that disc.  Oh, and speaking of tracks, there is no rhyme or reason as to where they start and stop.   <br /> <br />Finally, the book is laid out chronologically, rather than covering one major issue at a time.  This makes it difficult to follow.  He jumps from the miners' strike to campaigning to Panama to whatever so fast -- it's very hard to keep up with the 4 or 5 audio threads simultaneously.   <br /> <br />I won't argue with those who say the book is good, but the audio-book is a disappointment.	2005-10-12

Free.  <br /> <br />The complex yet accessible architecture was clear after the second read, provding a very different sense from what was derived from the first run through.

The stories themselves, moreover, are indeed more literary than perhaps more authentic collections, such as Kevin Danaher's, and are therefore a little more interesting to read.  I plan to use this text in a course on Irish literature both because the tales are a good introduction to Irish folklore and because the tales demonstrate how the early-twentieth-century Irish Renaissance adopted, adapted, and remolded the Irish Gaelic tradition.	2005-10-12

Hundreds of Questions You'd Only Ask a Doctor After Your Third Martini	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Entertaining, but lots of filler	Why Do Men Have Nipples is a generally clever little book that answers all sorts of silly questions that kind of float in the back of our minds but we rarely dare to ask.  There are details about all sorts of bodily functions and excretions as well as debunking of various myths about foods and drinks.  How dangerous are pop rocks?  Not very.  Does chocolate cause acne?  No. <br /> <br />While filled with all sorts of good information, the book does suffer from unnecessary filler, in particular the transcript of certain online chats the two authors had.  This filler material is rambling, only occasionally amusing and - as stated before - unnecessary.  In addition, for some of the questions addressed, we are given half-answers or non-answers that leave us remaining in the dark on the issue. <br /> <br />Despite the good, often witty, presentation of some of the information, these flaws are sufficient to reduce the book to a low four stars.  While I would recommend it based on its assets, I would also issue a warning that this book could be better. <br />	2005-10-12

Kazuma decides to challenge Kyo by encouraging him to reveal his \\"true form\\" to the world to get over his own worthlessness. Tohru sees Kyo's true self, and he runs from her in shame. Rather than deal with her rejection or pity he decides it would be best to avoid her at all costs.  There are some wonderful, tearful moments that follow as she decides if he is too hideous in his natural form or not. Kyo runs off before his master departs, leaving everyone in the Sohma house in shock at his disappearance. Tohru sees Kazuma off as he speaks about the true nature of his feelings in his relationship with Kyo.<br /><br />New feelings of distrust develop in the Sohma house as both Yuki and Kagura start to stray from the others.

Do they really care? <br /> <br />Pastor Ken Rogahn did. During the years he was pastor of Messiah Lutheran Church in St. Louis, he counseled a troubled teenager on a number of topics--without her realizing that counseling was taking place. Pastor Rogahn hired her (for $1 a session!) to care for his large collection of books, arranging and rearranging them in strange configurations, dusting them, supplying each with a bookmark. <br /> <br />All the while, as he worked at his desk, her wise and kindly pastor found ways to get her to talk about what was troubling her, and then used each situation to apply the Word of God and the love of Christ to her disturbed life. <br /> <br />Perhaps other teens have had similar experiences with their pastor, but this young woman has managed to write down--in intricate detail--what was said in those conversations and how she reacted to them in life-changing ways. <br /> <br />The result can well serve as a series of discussion starters for youth groups or as soul-searching reading for individual teens. <br /> <br />Although he died more than a decade ago, through the remembrances of J. Taylor Ludwig (now a parent herself), Pastor Rogahn may have a thing or two to share with fellow pastors, even today. <br /> <br />I knew him then, and through this book he spoke to me again.	2005-10-12

Her characters are always interesting and nuanced, not the stock character so often found in young adult fiction.  Her stories are set in interesting times and we always learn something we didn't know.  In Black Storm Comin, we get an insiders look not only into the Pony Express but also the challenges faced by the bi-racial rider.  And the horses!  Wilson can write about horses like no one else - she's taking over where Marguite Henry left off.  This is a great read and I look forward to her next one.  I recommend it for any reader, young or old, male or female.	2005-10-12

It is very pleasant to read and the author does not have an ax to grind.  He exploses John's strengths and weaknesses, but in a kind way and without sounding like a Lennon worshiper.<br /><br />  I have read many books about John and the Beatles.  I guess I believed I knew it all, but thanks to this book by Larry Kane, I learned a few more interesting tidbits.  Kane interviewed a number of people for this book including both the famous and the not at all famous.  Normally I would question the veracity and importance of interviewing, for example, a young man who worked as a Lennon gofer, but I found these little points delightful.<br /><br />  Unlike the other reviewers, I did not give this book a full 5 stars for two reasons:<br /><br />  1.  I believe the author spends too much time on John and his relationship with Stu Sutcliffe.  Stu was a good friend of John and an influence, but Kane elevates Stu to the same status as Yoko, Cynthia and May.  I don't buy it.  I imagine much of his information is gathered from Stu's sister who has a vested interest in  making Stu as important as possible.<br /><br />  2.  Second, based upon what I have read so far, although Mr. Kane did interview May and Yoko and attempted to interview Cynthia (who refused to cooperate) it appears there are no comments from some key people in John's life: the other Beatles, his aunts and uncles or his sons.  Paul and Ringo are still alive; George had opinions about John based on old interviews.  Plus it seems to me Sean and Julian should have fabulous insights into their father.  For some reason, this is all missing and seems odd since we have opinions from people who hardly knew John.<br /><br />  However, if you are a Lennon or Beatle fan, I highly recommend this book.	2005-10-12

There's many very smart people who are superb problem solvers.

The authors offered very specific examples of these kinds of interpretative conversations. <br /> <br />This book has good case studies about garment industry, cell phone industry and biotech.

Like John Wayne and Cary Grant, Bogart was larger than life, yet, unlike them, he was also down in the dirt with the rest of us. An average guy in many ways, the characters he played beat the odds, but only after enormous effort and struggle.<br /><br />A.M. Sperber's generally excellent biography shows that Bogart the icon and Bogart the man shared many similar traits. Though the son of a wealthy doctor and his artist wife, there was a dark side to Bogart's outwardly pampered life. His mother was distant, his father was addicted to morphine, and the young boy and his sisters, one of whom suffered from mental illness, were abused by the servants. Bogart was an academic failure with little hope for success until distinguishing himself on Broadway with his classic portrayal of Duke Mantee in \\"The Petrified Forest.\\"<br /><br />But even when Hollywood beckoned, life didn't get easier for the insecure actor. While James Cagney, George Raft, Paul Muni, and Edward G. Robinson were \\"stars\\" who got the best roles Warner Bros. had to offer, Bogart was taken for granted, a mere contract player who played supporting roles in the important projects, and spent years buried in a series of undistinguished B flicks churned out on the Hollywood assembly line. Well paid, especially by Depression era standards, he nonetheless struggled to support his ailing sisters and to pay off his late father's debts.<br /><br />Today, it's hard to believe his employers took so long to recognize the charisma and talent that Bogart would bring to \\"High Sierra\\" and \\"The Maltese Falcon,\\" both of which were intended for that great non-entity George Raft. \\"Casablanca,\\" of course, made Bogart the biggest star on the Warner lot, and Sperber shoots down the myth that both Raft and Ronald Reagan were initially considered for the role of Hollywood's ultimate romantic hero. For once, a role was tailor-made for Bogart, and the legend was born.<br /><br />Bogart's early life isn't covered as thoroughly as hoped, but that's not a surprise since most of those who could provide insight into the future superstar had died long before Sperber began her book. But the career is well documented, and the man behind the myth emerges as a flesh and blood figure, a fiercely intelligent and generally admirable one, on every page.<br /><br />Brian W.

Rene Descartes is often considered the founding father of modern philosophy. A true Renaissance man, he studied Scholastic philosophy and physics as a student, spent time as a volunteer soldier and traveler throughout Europe, studied mathematics, appreciated the arts, and became a noted correspondent with royals and intellectual figures throughout the continent. He died in Sweden while on assignment as tutor to the Queen, Christiana.<br /><br />Descartes 'Discourse on Method' is a fascinating text, combining the newly-invented form of essay (Descartes was familiar with the Essays of Montaigne) with the same kind of autobiographical impulse that underpins Augustine's Confessions. Descartes writes about his own form of mystical experience, seeing this as almost a kind of revelation that all past knowledge would be superseded, and all problems would eventually be solved by human intellect.<br /><br />In the Discourse, Descartes formulates logical principles based on reason (which makes it somewhat ironic that this came to him almost as a revelation). Descartes had some appreciation for thinkers such as Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes, but he thought that Bacon depended too much upon empirical data, and with Hobbes he disagreed on what would be the criteria for ascertaining certainty.<br /><br />Descartes was a mathematician at heart, and perhaps had a carry-over of Pythagorean mystical attachment to mathematics, for his sense of reason led him to impute an absolute quality to mathematics; this has major implications for metaphysics and epistemology. Descartes method was a continuation in many ways of the ideas of Plato, Aristotle and the medieval thinkers, for they all tended toward thinking in absolute, universal terms in some degree.<br /><br />Descartes in his first section discounts much of Scholasticism, stating that the only real absolutes are theology and mathematics; because theology is based upon revelation, it is therefore beyond reason, and thus, mathematics becomes the only rational truth. Descartes develops this idea further with rules of method, which include ideas of intuition, analysis and deduction. He uses some of his method to come up with his greatest proposition:<br /><br />Cogito ergo sum - - I think, therefore I am<br /><br />'The Cogito is a first principle from which Descartes will now deduce all that follows.' This permits Descartes to deal both with rational elements and empirical data.<br /><br />This is an important text; the 'Discourse on Method' is one that I read the summer before I went to college, and makes a good study for those who wish to see the personal element in the development of philosophy.mathematics becomes the only rational truth.

But I mostly read romances, so I might not be the best judge since this new book is more of an adventure. Dez and Jay are supposed to be getting away from it all on a camping trip with their friends, but nothing turns out the way they were expecting after Jay gets kidnapped by an unlikely pair of escaped convicts. The book then becomes the story of Dez trying to find Jay in the wilderness and imagining the worst. This becomes a bit of a fiasco and I was found it hard to stay interested, but that could be a matter of personal taste because I always want romance and sex in the books that I read and this one offered neither. Even though the writing quality in Have Gun We'll Travel is the best I've seen from this author, I thought Gun Shy was a better story. Next time, I'm ready for a new plot and new characters from Ms. Lake. I've had my last date with Dez and Jay.	2005-10-12

Paris Montague is happy with her no-strings,commitment-free personal life.  She has bigger issues to be concerned about-like when is she going to move up in her father's lobbying firm; she wants him to allow her the chance to prove that she is worthy and capable of handling more complex projects.  After all, she does have two degrees, including a Masters in Business Administration (MBA), and she is more than capable of handling whatever comes her way.  Actually, some new ideas and out of the box concepts might be just what the firm needs to move into the new Millennium and a higher revenue bracket.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Paris's mom, the perpetual, busy body and control freak, has other plans for Paris.  She believes that at Paris' age that Paris is too old to be a single woman and she needs someone who can take care of her; preferably a wealthy man or at least one who is more well off than Paris.  While Paris is busy keeping company with her `maintenance man,' her mother is busy looking for eligible men in \\"Who's Who in African American Wealth\\" and believes that she has found a suitable mate for her daughter.  Enters Jabari Nolan, who is as fake as a two (2) dollar coin but as savvy and debonair as they come.  However, he does not have anything in his past that a comprehensive background check would not have uncovered upfront. Question is will anyone discover who he really is before he says \\"I Do.\\"<br /><br />Foxx's books are usually hit or miss for me and I almost passed on her latest novel.  Recently, I have been reading blogs of various authors and one of the blogs that I enjoy checking out regularly is Foxx's.  I enjoy reading her blogs so much so that I decided to take a chance on Marrying Up.  I am happy to say that it was a HIT for me!  Marrying Up is a charming and fun read that successfully combines romance, intrigue and suspense.  Foxx travels familiar terrain with Marrying Up and the ending is very predictable, but the backdrop as well as surprising twists and turns help to set it apart from similar storylines.  One added bonus of Marrying Up was the opportunity to read excerpts from Foxx's blogs/journals. If you haven't had a chance to experience Foxx's commentaries, visit her site and check her out today.  Foxx is a writer who does not appear to veer very far from the same storyline themes, however, for those moments when I am looking for an Entertainment Purposes Only (EPO) read she has the ability to satisfy and quench that thirst.

I'm a fan of her contemporary romantic suspense, and thought I'd give her historical work a try.<br /><br />The book was extremely slow at the beginning.  In fact, it seemed so dry and slow-paced that I contemplated not even finishing it.  Luckily it picked up about halfway through and had a fairly exciting finish.<br /><br />I won't go into the details of the plot because I don't want to ruin all of the twists and turns for any potential readers, but in a nutshell, I just had a hard time buying this story.  In particular, I found the romance to be extremely shaky.  The protagonists hardly spent any time together, as much of the story was spent in flashbacks.  These \\"glimpses into the past\\" only made me dislike the hero.  The little twist at the end only made it worse, not better.  And to add insult to injury there was no closure whatsoever between the characters.  After the big \\"exposure of the villain\\" scene, we only see the protagonists together through a secondary character's eyes.  After putting up with the heroine's repetitive internal monologue for the entire story, we don't get inside her head at the critical finale.  Where was the usual happy ending?<br /><br />The romance in this is deserving of 1 star in my opinion, but the mystery was somewhat intriguing, so I gave it two stars overall.  Like the romance, the mystery had quite a few gaps and while I thought the Redeemer was portrayed very well as beeing an evil creep, his identity and motivation turned out to be cliche and a big let down.	2005-10-12

This is a great book for anyone who hasn't read the old interviews contained within this volume. However, I have read these interviews over the years and so there are no insights for anyone else who read them in The Comics Journal over the years. The art contained within this volume, on the other hand, is quite wonderful and a good deal of it is different, an update from the original interviews. Make no mistake, this book is a great art  collection with insightful, if older interviews to round it out. The large format is guite nice for showcasing the art as well.  <br />If you've somehow missed the interviews this is an opportunity to get into the heads of some stellar talents in the illustration and comic art field. With a line up a talent featuring the works and words of Frank Frazetta, Russ Manning, Burne Hogarth, Mark Schultz and Russ Heath, it's hard to imagine how the editors at TCJ could mess this up and, of course, they didn't. <br />My big beef is the lack of better Manning and Heath art. The examples are fine but I hoped for better, perhaps rarer samples. <br />That's a small complaint.	2005-10-12

I agree that John Nunn's book is a goldmine of useful tips, and includes many a remedy for bad habits. The great thing about Nunn's writing is that he does not have an agenda. Unlike, say, an author trying to sell you his book on a dubious opening variation. Nunn just tells it as it is.<br /><br />The chapter on building an opening repertoire should be compulsory reading for anyone serious about improvement, or who wishes to better their competitive results. Keys lessons: a) never, ever, play the Latvian Gambit, and b) choose a sensible and sound opening repertoire.<br /><br />GM Nunn devotes the first third of the book to the role of decision making (including the analysis tree thing) and examining why oversights happen. There follows the opening section, which mainly consists of that stern warning: do not be seduced by the lure of those off-beat lines. Unsound variations will do nothing for your long term improvement. The comes the middlegame section, dealing with good positions, bad positions, attack and defense.<br /><br />I was surprised to find the endgame section equally  fascinating. The final 50 or so pages feature all manner of practical situations, and cover a wide range of typical  scenarios.

His charts and eaze of language makes the text readable and enlightening.

So this one took me by surprise!    Brian Hodge manages to bring in what works really well with Mike's comics: the mood and the humor. But he also brings something that's sadly missing from Hellboy's drawn stories: the sense of details. I mean when you have so many cool objects and characters and locations and monsters... it's a pity that the whole thing is gone in 2 or 3 little comic books, isn't it?    At least with this book we get to dive in some of the characters' previous life and the result is that we start caring about them. And I don't get that a lot from the comic book...    Then again what we DON'T have is Mike Mignola's beautiful artwork which is what made me buy the first comics back then. A cover is ok but some inside illustrations would have been better.    In the end I have really enjoyed this book and will buy the next ones.	2005-10-12

Winter can be a cold, lonely and dangerous time for a bird that didn't fly south. But in The Bird in Santa's Beard, help comes from Santa Claus himself. Santa invites the cold and hungry bird to nest in the warm safety of his beard. During the long winter Santa and the bird develop a deep friendship. They solve problems and share the secret of Santa's helpers. And when Christmas morning arrives, Santa receives a grand gift just for him. <br /> <br />The Bird in Santa's Beard is the story of an unlikely friendship between Santa and a bird and how a simple kindness makes a difference.  <br /> <br />I so enjoyed learning how Santa came to have all of his helpers. Children will enjoy this book with a subtle and important message. The photographs are wonderful and a nice change of pace from other illustrated books. The cover is exactly the way I have always pictured jolly old Santa.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: This is a splendid addition to a child's Christmas library. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

One rule of fiction is that the main character has to undergo a change by the end of the story.  Well, Emma wasn't the same person her family knew. Oh yeah, she'd lost weight.  There was also a greater interest in church.  But they really didn't spend much time with her.  The key was in her last words, which they missed too.  Read the journal!  Her friends knew about that journal.  Many had started keeping one too.  Entries are included, though not in chronological order.  Besides changing her own life, Emma had impacted her entire community.  When the journal is missing, her friends lead the charge to find it.  They also reach out to her family.  This story is quite intriguing.  Her daughter-in-law is quite a trip.  She's mean and controlling.  Her husband and pastor usually give in to her wishes.  She flaunts her faith, but doesn't really live it.  Maybe you've known someone like this.  Even worse is to be that person.  Emma's daughter has her own problems.  Her husband left her for a man.  She had a daughter out of wedlock.  This girl is inspired to start her own journal.  Maybe you will be too.  My only beef is that the ending could have been stronger.  Still, this is a page turner.  I highly recommend it.  We could use more Emmas.  She reached out to others, regardless of age, race, or background.  You will be greatly blessed.	2005-10-12

I think \\"grade-school level\\" is an exaggeration--most of the projects are fairly simple, but some show interesting techniques and/or would be suitable for a beginning (adult) quilter, especially one who doesn't necessarily want to tackle a bed-size quilt.

I read this book when it was first released in the late 1970's. It was recommended to me by my father, an avid reader and bibliophile. I was only 18 years old, but this wonderous novel had the same impact as CATCH 22 or RAGTIME did for me. I knew this book would be with me my whole life, and that I would return to it time and again. I have since read it four times, and I just finished it again late this evening. Instead of sleeping I decided to write some slender memories: seeing John Kennedy Toole's mother on THE TOM SNYDER SHOW in the early 1980's had a profound impact on me. When she told of her son's struggles and difficulties getting this work published, prior to taking his own life at a criminally young age, I realized that it is one of life's great mysteries how so many publishers passed on this book. It was only at the urging of Walker Percy that the LSU press first published this masterpiece.  Being blind to genius is a universal privilege, after all! <br /> <br />On my fifth complete reading I still laughed as Ignatius rolls his hot dog cart down the street with the sign \\"12 Inches of Paradise\\" handwritten on the side. And I was once again felt melancholic when I finished this book, because I will never be able to read another novel by this misunderstood literary genius. Ah Fortuna, what a cruel vixen you are.......	2005-10-12

It is clearly organized in 6 chapters, plus an introduction and a conclusion, and you can find useful information about most of the narratives that are part of the cannon of Spanish American fiction.  In that sense, it is not a revolutionary or innovative work, and owes a lot to the previous research by scholars such as John Brushwood, although Lindstrom incorporates recent scholarship as well in her work.  That's the only reason I do not give it 5 stars.  Note also that the book does not include the literature of Brazil or other non Spanish-speaking countries of the continent (it is not Latin American narrative, only Spanish American). <br />Recommended for libraries and students interested in Spanish American literature and culture.	2005-10-12

I have read other books in the series where the saddle club visited Kate and Christene, and they were fine. Enjoyable, quite actually. This one was far from it. The whole book seemed to keep riders thinking that western was so much better than english. Horseback riding descrimination. To tell you the truth, those silly dusters they adored so much over their english 'togs' are enough to make any person look like they're a real dude. (Even though I am an English rider) They kept saying how the rodeo was so much more fun compared to any other show they'd ever seen! To tell you the truth, I found most of the book quite boring. The English competitions were a lot more exciting in my opinion, and another thing to point out, when they went to English horse shows they didn't say, \\"Wow. Isn't this the best competition than any we've ever seen?\\" I found myself skimming listlessly over paragraphs trying to finish this horrid book. Then, at the end, when the girls were finally back in Pine Hollow, they were saying, \\"Don't you wish you were back at the bar none?\\" \\"Yeah, much more exciting than this place.\\" Well, whoop de doo. At this point, they could just pack their bags, move back out west, change their club name to the bar none riders and compete in more of those stupid rodeo competitions for all I care. Just don't expect me to pick up another book again in the series if they did that. There was some saddle club mischief that was non-descriminal, but it wasn't enough to keep this book from going down the toilet. I hope the next one I read is about Pine Hollow, but of course, it isn't NEARLY as exciting as their beloved \\"Bar None\\". Well, I'm sorry but I did not like this book. Most people think that english riders are snots that look down on western riders. After reading this book, they should reconfigure that fact! I am insulted that they would want to trash the riding that I love most in this book. Especially coming from the saddle club!  Mrs. Bryant, whom I've come to respect through some of the better ones, can just shove this one up her ass.ct through some of the better ones, can just shove this one up her ass.	2005-10-12

While I am a fan of his entire library, I must admit that this one is one of his few books to really reach out to the pedestrian reader of his novels. <br /> <br />  One of the problems that many will have with Saramago's works is that the often chase zebras.  This book seams to be more in hunting horses.  What I mean by that is that this book does not start off with strange and somewhat tangential issues.  In the Stone Raft all of these matters came together and an island broke off, in All of the Names an idea becomes lodged in a mans head, etc.  This book is easy to understand in its fundamental premise, there is a plague.  This will allow, I feel, for the ordinary reader to begin the book with their mind opened and their brain intrigued. <br /> <br />  Unbothered by he said, she said, and all sorts of punctuation, this book allows the reader to leave the story elements of the novel behind and really become a part of the action.  Though this same lacking of punctuation will cause some unclarity in the primary chapters as to who is speaking, etc.  The problem is easy to get around as you begin to understand the characters. <br /> <br />  One other thing that some may find annoying is the insertion of graphic sexual dealings in the middle of the book.  It seams too often that graphic and dirty (in the dirt-like sense, not even in the sordid sense) has to be shoved some place in a book that is attempting to be literature.  It really gets to be too much.  Of course, the importance on the dealings of the characters is of high importance, but it also strikes me as swinging for the R rating in a movie.  Once it is done, it quickly leaves. <br /> <br />  Overall this is a wonderful book.  It is the exploration of a group of people clinging to each other as the world acts upon them, an exploration of fear and of the rights and needs of individuals vs. the community, and anexploration of a man and woman fighting for survival in the world together.	2005-10-12

Finn's background takes a page or three from Horatio Alger. An orphan from the streets of Boston, Finn was in the process of flushing his life down a deep, dark sewer before reversing course and channeling his tenacious, take-no-prisoners attitude and aptitude into law school and subsequently into the courtroom. His skills as a public defender attracted the attention of Howery, Black & Longbothum, Boston's most prestigious legal firm, and as DARK HARBOR opens he is on a fast track to become a partner in the firm.  <br /> <br />Finn is part of a team defending Huron Security, one of the firm's most significant clients, from a wrongful death action when Natalie Caldwell, lead attorney on the Huron Case (as well as Finn's friend and former lover), is found brutally murdered. Caldwell appears to be the latest victim of Little Jack, a serial killer who has left the people of Boston terrorized and the police dumbfounded. Boston Police Detective Linda Flaherty, however, isn't certain that Caldwell's death is truly connected to the Jack murders.  <br />DARK HARBOR is an impressive debut by an author whose talent looks to run deep, and long.

Late in 1852 the Crosbys returned to California where she recorded the post-Gold Rush life of San Francisco, and the new Mormon village of San Bernardino in southern California. Then in 1857, returning to Utah in response to a call from Brigham Young where she resided for the remainder of her life.

Many students who return to school after ten, twenty or more years, having only barely passed high school (or, in some cases, not having passed high school and having obtained a GED instead) find that their basic reading skills have deteriorated - they can read the newspaper or magazine articles somewhat, and can handle various kinds of forms with differing levels of comfort, but the idea of actually reading academic textbooks and working with the information dynamically and analytically is a difficult prospect.<br /><br />Langan's book is useful for a one-semester course or five-to-six month course of one-on-one tutoring. This could also be used in a group setting, and many things in the book are designed to be used in any of these contexts. There are ten primary steps, and ten reading selections in the book. The ten steps are as follows:<br /><br />- Clear thinking<br /><br />- Vocabulary in context<br /><br />- Main ideas<br /><br />- Supporting details<br /><br />- Location of main ideas<br /><br />- Implied main ideas<br /><br />- Relationships - patterns involving addition or involving time<br /><br />- Further Relationships - examples, comparison and contrast, cause and effect<br /><br />- Inferences<br /><br />- Active Reading<br /><br />Each chapter is organised essentially in the same manner. There are sections that are fill-in-the-blank, requiring attentive reading to supply the information; there are explanations and examples of each skills presented, and there are review tests. The review tests (four for each chapter) look at developing comprehension, skills practice, and cumulative skills application. There are also mastery tests that increase in difficulty throughout the text. The tests are tear-out pages, so that they can be handed in for scoring.<br /><br />Each reading selection includes work with vocabulary, reading comprehension, outlining, summarising, and answering discussion questions.<br /><br />This book gives LOTS of practice.

Since the website also included fantasy, The Lord of the Rings, as expected, came up as the number one over all, but for pure science fiction, this is it.  I read this book when it was passed around the office and everyone that read it, loved it.  This has everything good and exciting science fiction is known for, aliens, space war, fate of the human race.  Really it touches upon good and evil, which is a cross genre topic, so many not generally interested in science fiction can find it interesting.  Like the Matrix, Harry Potter, the Lord of the Rings, the main character is `the one' and all the responsibility that entails.  What would one do when everything depends on ones actions and decisions.  The basic plot I'm sure you've read elsewhere.  The book is somewhat historically similar to the conditions leading to the defeat of the Japanese in World War II and the difficult decisions made then.	2005-10-12

If you've not bought this yet, you haven't started looking.<br /><br />Richard Bolles is the expert.

It continues to influence me today, as I job hunt again.<br /><br />Thoroughly practical, Bolles asks you questions about your mission in life. His belief is that just getting a job -- even ones you are good at -- won't be a wise decision in the long haul. He helps you see your passions mixed with skills and experience, and guides you to getting their. Though it is hardly a self-help book, it is far more useful than the ones clogging up the Top 10 list.<br /><br />He keeps you accountable. Finding a job is your job if that's what you say you want. And if you aren't working, he won't let you make excuses -- you've got the time. Either you are looking or you aren't.

Oh we all guessed on who it was going to be.  I had three guesses and had reasons for them all.  In the end one of my guesses was right, actually in a strange way two of them were. <br /> <br />It was really the only way the story could have ended, sad as it is, someone had to die so that Harry had no choice but to confront Voldemort. <br /> <br />Basic plot:  Harry and co are getting ready to take their O.W.L or possible N.E.W.T. (I forget which one) and are nervouse about the outcome.  Added to that, tensions between just about everyone is at an all time high.   Snape has finally gotten a shot to teach Defense against dark arts and their is a new potions teacher who takes a liking to Harry and Hermoine but has no use for Ron.  Dumbledore has agreed to show Harry some more about who and what Voldemort really is.  And finally Harry finds a potions book that makes him the star of potions class, that once belonged to someone who calls himself, the \\"Half Blood Prince.\\" <br /> <br />The this chapter of the Harry Potter Saga is tragic in a lot of ways, but also quite lovely.  You see once again how close Harry really is to the friends he has made since the first book.  One scene in particular where Ron's mother (forget her name) after Harry saves the life of one of her children, tells Harry that thier family is lucky to have him in thier lives, and you just know that Harry is thinking that he is the lucky one. <br /> <br />All in all a beautiful and tragic story about growing up and chosing what is really important in life.	2005-10-12

I live in Zone 8/B in south Georgia and so many plants labeled to grow in this area do not.  Since Dirr is from Georgia I thought this book would be just what the doctor ordered. Well, not exactly. <br />     I loved having the color photos but was not impressed with the number of plants he excluded or included for that matter.  I was hoping for the same format as his previous book, listing all the qualities and pros and cons.  What I got was some pics with a paragraph or two (some without pictures at all) describing a few things about it. Some of the plants listed are common, even weedy.  My main beef is that it is sometimes hard to tell exactly where they should grow because of the way it is written.  Example: Zones (8)9 to 10. New Zealand,Australia, Tazmania. I assume the countries are where the plant originated but I can't tell if it grow in Zone 8 or not. There are also problems when he describes a plant that grows on the west coast.  Example:Zones 6 to 8, 9 to 10 on the west coast. Does this mean 6 to 8 anywhere and also in 9 and 10 on the west coast or all the zones on the west coast only?  I think my biggest problem occured in thinking since he was from Georgia he would be talking about the warm, humid climate in the southeast.  It seems like a majority of the plants are for the Pacific Coast region.  Like I said, my mistake.  I got some good ideas but having decided on a holly that I want, have not been able to find it anywhere, even online. I am not sorry I spent the money but if I had had an actual copy in hand, say at the library or in Barnes and Noble, I would have just copied down the names of what interested me and jumped on the computer at home.   <br />	2005-10-12

This is the book to read when one who never heard of Nostradamus should get. Easy read and opened, honest opinions all stated in points (quatrains of Nostradamus) where the author was unable to explain (translate).<br /><br />The book starts off pointing to the life of Nostradamus who was a decendant of Jewish family. He, like everyone in a religious union during the 1500 period in Europe, had to escape the persecution of being what he later decided to devout to the Lord. This book should be followed up with a second volume to fill in those quatrains unexplained by the author as I would think that she's re-reading her translations and all the unexplained quatrains which now today she may have figured out.<br /><br />This is a fantastic read and very intriguing for sure. I like the mystical aurora it presents. From time to time, I would pick it up and find translations that has just come true or find some that are partially prophesized.<br /><br />However, the Bible is the source of all prophecies. And that really is coming to light today.	2005-10-12

I recently took courses in 3DMax, Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects.  Ok, so now what?  This is where Mike's books come in. His books are not step by step technical instructions on how to create computer graphics art  but more about stimulating the artistic side of your brain and imagination as to the kinds of art that can be created using computer graphics tools. This book is not about CG technology, it's about CG art. If your background is purely technical I would recommend this book in conjunction with a couple of art courses. Great computer art is not created by CG technicians  but by CG artist. Mike gives you guidelines as to what you can do as a skilled CG artist. He does not show you in detail how to create the art shown in the book. I guess he assumes that if you know the CG tool well enough then you should be able to figure out the details. Again this is a book about computer art, it is not about technology.	2005-10-12
US	51958864	R38IH4Y2ZU4X33	0262611384	74562743	Soviet Strategic Thought, 1917-91 (BCSIA Studies in International Security)	Books	5	7	7	N	Y	Must read for the serious Cold War student	This comparatively brief (a little over 200 pp) overview is cogent, focused, and indispensable.  It was written by a senior officer who spent his journeyman years under Soviet premiers from Brezhnev to Gorbachev, but filled prominent positions in the senior defense councils of de-imperialized Russia in the 1990s.  It reflects both his intimate knowledge of accepted strategic-military theory in the old Soviet Union, and his ability to step outside that tradition for a critical look. <br /> <br />Kokoshin tells his intended story well, and in that simple sense conveys a useful message.  But a Western reader learns much more from a contextual analysis of his information.  Possibly the most poignant passage is found on pp 186-7 of the 1999 MIT Press paperback edition, where Kokoshin paints a picture of Soviet military theorists in the 1980s focusing all their energies on the lessons of WWII and the Battle of Kursk. <br /> <br />The powerful counterpoint of that image with the reality of American theoretical efforts at the same time is not what Kokoshin intends to evoke -- but that in itself is another telling fact.  The overall impression one compiles from reading this book is that while the United States was, decade after decade, improving its ability to \\"project power\\" globally and wage expeditionary warfare on a large scale (e.g., Desert Storm), the Soviet Union was busy fitting all the new technology, new weapons, and new logistic potential into the land warfare mold of WWII. <br /> <br />The book reinforces this impression from start to finish.  Acclaimed Soviet theorist Mikhail Tukhachevsky wrote what essentially became the Warsaw Pact strategy vs NATO in an issue of the Journal of Military History in 1934, under the perennial Soviet belief that the capitalist powers would seek to invade Russia in force -- and that strategy changed only in its employment of weapons and tactics over the next 50 years.  Kokoshin confirms the conclusion of many Western analysts thatin the 1960s-70s the Soviet military saw nuclear weapons as adjuncts to a campaign strategy, rather than as agents for transforming war into a cosmic Gotterdammerung.  It was in the 1980s that Soviet thinking began to reject nuclear use as unrealistic, in the way American thinking had begun to more than a decade earlier. <br /> <br />Kokoshin presents his history without once indicating that the Soviets found the concept of mutual assured destruction philosophically compelling, and I find no reason to disbelieve him.  It is just possible that American and Soviet Russian modes of strategic thinking were out of sync through much of the Cold War.  Kokoshin provides another argument for this assessment in conveying the Soviet perception of the USSR's overall strategic situation, throughout its life:  i.e., surrounded, by wealthy maritime powers. <br /> <br />Contrast this with the governing perception of most Western thinkers, that the key geopolitical factor in the global situation was Soviet landpower versus Europe.  Halford Mackinder and Nicholas Spykman did their work well in this regard, giving us the World Island/Heartland vs Rimland construct, and reflecting the Western European/American Rimland as peripheral and importunate against a great land power (Soviet Russia) with a continent at its back. <br /> <br />Few in the West saw the situation as the Soviets did, even while the West gradually accumulated both the technology and doctrine to \\"project\\" land power over the sea in a way the continental Soviet Union could not.  Kokoshin's history doesn't lead me to think the Soviets saw this discrepancy clearly either; they just represented one side of it.  Perhaps the West's rapidly improving ability to project power through expeditionary warfare increased the Soviet sense of surroundedness, but apparently it did not persuade the Soviets to rethink their own core military strategy, which remained boresighted on armor and deep battle in central Europe. <br /> <br />An additional lesson from Kokoshin's book is the difference in the evolution of military-strategic thought when it is not subject to public political criticism, as opposed to when it is.  Western military theorists are never insulated from political trends and second-guessing, as Soviet thinkers once were.  Possibly a little more outside review might have provoked greater foresight and less geopolitical atrophy in Soviet strategic thought.  One must admit, however, that vigorous dispute and political oversight in the West, while they drove a forward-leaning development of global expeditionary capability, didn't perform very well at pinpointing or exploiting the self-perception of the Soviet opponent.  All systems have their limitations.	2005-10-12

I have vowed to make notes on all of the library books we check out each week so that, should I have a book faintly perched on the edge of my mind, I will be able to scan back through my reviews until I find the one I am remembering.  That said, this book has been the naptime request of my 4 year old for several days and she \\"read\\" it to a pillow on the sofa just yesterday.  She especially loves the phrase \\"Where, oh where, is my child?\\"  She got that one dead-on.  This is an excellent book for retelling and could be acted out very successfully in a short dramatic play in kindergarten.  The plot is simple and fun and leads to great discussions about how humans prepare for winter (gathering the harvest, preserving foods by canning them) vs. animals who hibernate (that would be the bear).  This book is, of course, need I say it????  A winner.  You won't be disappointed if you purchase this one.  And little Sal (Sally?  It's a girl) is as cute as a button.

Lawson does not seem very favorably disposed to those she describes.  She describes some who behave rather badly (killing their children in some cases). <br /> There's always been a problem with psychiatric diagnoses that we cannot confirm by blood tests or X-rays. The \\"borderline personality\\" diagnosis is especially fuzzy. It fits anyone who is selfish and over-emotional.  Lawson stretches the diagnosis to include a number of well-known personalities she has never met, and blurs the edges even more. She adds a typology of her own; the waif, the queen, the witch and the hermit. These are just off the top of her head and are not validated by any kind of statistics or experimental work.  When she does mention anything about brain chemistry or anatomy or about medication it's in passing, and some of it is wrong.  <br /> The ways of managing such mothers she suggests are more in the nature of advice for their children (often quite good advice) than proven methods of therapy. <br /> The quality of the writing is excellent. The author knows how to tell a story and keep the pages turning. I'm sure many will read it and recognize situations or people they have encountered, as we do when we read a good novel. This is closer to imaginative literature than to science, but it's very good imaginative literature. <br />	2005-10-12

In a novel where dialogue is rich and continuous one can imagine how fortunate this is.<br />Someone should also have told the publisher that the cover picture, though beautiful in itself, has nothing to do with the Vth century b.C. Greece Ms Renault takes so much pain to depict.<br /><br />This author has a beautiful sense of storytelling: the plot itself is nothing new to a contemporary reader, the love and friendship of two young men in a Greece illuminated by Sokrates' thinking and devastated by a cruel war, but she tells it, simply and compellingly, and she never fails to keep her reader's interest.<br /><br />Before discussing the book's flaws I wish to stress how this novel stands out among ordinary fiction. This told, one has to point out that the philosophing is often clumsy; the competitions rhetorical and the overall style not always as polished as in some paragraphs Ms Renault ha clearly written with more care.<br /><br />To me there is another flaw but I admit it would be unjust to give it undue weight, this book belonging to a woman probably born at the beginning of the century.<br />She writes with ease of the homosexual liaisons typical of ancient Greece, making no fuss about them and giving her attention to the feelings involved, but she betrays her embarassment when dealing with her two main heroes: she makes two disciples of Sokrates' ideas about love of them, thus avoiding too close physical intimacy between the two; later, when they finally surrender to their passion, the fact is hardly mentioned and NEVER quoted again.	2005-10-12

Look just a millimetre below the surface and the fairies fly away leaving clear writing with insightful explanations and suggestions of what might prove to be the most successful direction to go in with a horse of particular character.  <br />Having owned hot-bloods for most of my life, I have been especially helped by some of his suggestions for training cold-blooded, apparently less-reactive types who need different, but even more sensitive, handling if they are not to become the typical riding school 'plod' or descend into lazy stubborness. <br /> <br />The fact that this book is full of beautiful photos only enhances the beauty of Hempfling's work with every type of horse.	2005-10-12

If you're a die-hard Austen fan, you might not want to read this because it doesn't draw faithfully from the plot (like the movie Pride and Prejudice: a Latter-Day Comedy which I love too!) Instead takes certain social issues from the original and parodies the Mormon culture, like the insane mom who doesn't care who her daughters date as long as they get married, loser user guys who womanize, guys thinking all Mormon girls just want a husband, and the richer the better, etc.  My favorite is the Mr. Collins character.

It seems as if he decided that something was true, then wrote around the \\"facts\\" as he knew them, making up things as he went along. <br /> <br />The main thesis, that the conflict between America and Japan was all about dominance in China, is unsubstantiated by any facts that the author presents. The last assertion made, that America \\"failed\\" to maintain dominance in Asia, collapses under the weight of logic: when did America ever try to dominate Asia?  If it was trying to dominate Asia, why give up the Phillipines, as we had agreed to do BEFORE 1941?  <br /> <br />Factual errors abound in the last 2/3rds of the the book, too many to recount.  The author knows little of how military operations work, and shows little appreciation for long-range plans or logistical considerations.  Coral Sea isn't even mentioned, the insignificant Japanese nuclear project is given way too much space, but the Mao and the Reds in China are lovingly recounted. <br /> <br />The final, minor thesis, that Japan was about to surrender before Hiroshima, would be laughable if it were not ludicrous, especially since the War Council was preparing to dissolve what little civil government there was left in August 1945.  The tremendous buildup of troops and supplies on Kyushu in the summer of 1945 gives the lie to the entire idea. <br /> <br />Everything in it beginning with Pearl Harbor, and some of that before, is a waste of pulp and time.  I only regret that I spent money on this mess, and the time I spent reading it I will never get back again.	2005-10-12

But he is convinced she will win the Democratic nomination in 2008 and that she will be a formidable opponent. The only person he thinks can beat her is Condi Rice. I have been saying this for months.    All over America, black leaders are wondering how in hell they are going to explain to their constituents that voting for a white woman from Wellesley will advance the cause of blacks more than voting for a black woman from Birmingham, Alabama. To their credit, many of these leaders will realize that this argument is untenable, a dog that just won't hunt. They will drop Hillary like a hot potato and throw their support behind Condi.     Ironic. The Dems have spent the last 40 years cultivating the black vote. They now get 9 out of 10 black votes. If Condi runs, it could go 9 out of 10 the other way. Think that's an exaggeration? Think again. Recall the jubilation that took place in the \\"black street\\" when OJ, a real scoundrel, was acquitted of murder charges. Now imagine the jubilation that will break out in the black street when Condi, a national treasure, is elected the first black President of the United States. The following consideration will be weighed in the mind of every black voter standing in the voting booth on Election Day in 2008: \\"By my vote I can put the first African-American in the White House; am I going to pass up this opportunity and vote for Hillary instead???\\"    And then, think about how women will vote. First off, Condi's views on abortion mirror precisely those of the majority of women in America today: she is pro-choice, but in favor of reasonable restrictions on abortion. Second, Condi is living, breathing proof that women can shatter the \\"glass ceiling\\" and reach the highest levels of executive power. Finally, as a professional educator who implemented major reforms in undergraduate education at Stanford, Condi will appeal to all the mothers for whom the quality of their children's education is a major concern. Many of Hillary's female supporters will start off vehemently opposed to Condi, but they will quickly realize how hollow their arguments against her sound. They will undergo a sudden conversion and defect to Condi in droves.    And then, think about how the intellectual elite will vote. All we've been hearing for the last 8 years is how \\"dumb\\" Dubya is. Well, that argument won't work with Condi. PhD in international affairs; faculty member and provost of Stanford University; concert pianist playing recitals with Yo Yo Ma. This girl's got it goin' on! You want intellectual elite? Condi makes Dominique de Villepin look like a bumpkin from the French countryside. The last time we had a candidate with \\"intellectual credentials\\" like this was Woodrow Wilson.    So, it's obvious that Condi can make significant inroads into traditionally Democratic voting blocs. And it's also obvious that she's got the support of libertarian, neocon white males like myself. And it's also obvious that, as 1.) the daughter of a preacher and herself a woman of faith and 2.) a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, she will do well in the red states. One way to sum up Condi's broad-based appeal is to say: Condi is the moderate Hillary pretends to be (see Morris' \\"Hillary Brand\\"). She is the Democrats' worst nightmare.    Whom would Condi pick as her running mate? How about another moderate like, say, Bill Clinton? Come on, Bill, dump the ice queen and hook up with a real woman! In all seriousness, the bipartisan choice of someone like Joe Lieberman would be a master stroke.    Condi, you are a person that men and women, blacks and whites, intellectuals and people of faith can stand behind in unison. Your candidacy has the potential to heal many of the divisions that have torn America apart for decades. Run, Condi, run!	2005-10-12

I can only think of one previous novel which so deftly explored the inner demons of someone losing their memory, and that was Peter Dickinson's thriller ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE, in which the detective hero found himself in an old age home and, although barely able to keep it together, made one more triumphant leap into deduction (and action) to keep one last crime at bay.<br /><br />Nick, the hero of OBLIVION, isn't a very nice guy, and only through losing something (his memories of a \\"lost weekend\\" during which he began investigating a case of a runaway girl) does he come to his senses morally speaking.  His difficult relationship with his estranged son, Dmitri, and his nagging love for a former wife who walked out on him when she found him cheating with a partner--these relationships change as Nick finds it within himself to change and to try imagining how others may feel for once.  This brings up all sorts of satisfying speculations on what is the nature of personality?  Is it something consistent, essentialist, that doesn't change, or is it entirely a mode of chemical behavior?<br /><br />One little side note, I loved the TV movie of the week that was made out of Nick's work on the Reasoner case.  Abrahams has the casting down pat--Armand Assante as himself, Kim Delaney (herself the troubled good girl for whom America still cherishes a soft spot) and Dennis Franz, Delaney's co-star on NYPD Blue, as the mad serial killer Gerald Reasoner.  I'd watch it, and hate myself in the morning!  But reading OBLIVION you just crawl out on some primitive branch of pleasure like an ocelot, and soak in the sun.<br /><br />Kudos also to the book designer, who uses numbers and capital letters with parts of them melted off, to parallel Nick's fading memories.	2005-10-12

Farewell to Arms is a love story set amist the horrors and pointlessness of World War I.  This book has many autobiographical elements and it shows at Hemingway is really writing from the heart here.<br /><br />Personally I feel this is an \\"atmosphere\\" book which pretty much means you either \\"get it\\" or you don't.  It probably depends on how much you can relate to the two main characters and their situation.  They find each other and create something beautiful amongst the horror all around them.  There isn't much in the way of plotting so you have to appreciate the relationship aspect of the story.  The writing is classic Hemingway and he puts you right into the story with the best of them.<br /><br />This book is more than just a love story and like most Hemingway it touches upon various themes of man, love and futility.  This book isn't as complete as For Whom The Bell Tolls but it's one his best nonetheless.  It's easy reading and the story is linear and straightforward.  It's appropriate for 16 year olds and up and you don't have to have read many classics to \\"get it\\".<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Those looking to explore Hemingway might want to start with this book as it is a good intro into this amazing author.  Also this book shouldn't be read by anyone clinically depressed as it can be extremely sad at times.	2005-10-12

Warner believes that these negative parental images are obscure, metaphorical, and atavistic visages from an early time, when overt and covert competition for immediate survival amongst family members was a terrifying fact of daily life.<br /><br />Warner suggests that while most parents may today fulfill the required roles of guardian, nurturer, and provider in most cases most of the time, every adult has the inherent potential to relinquish one or all of them, and become an abandoner at best, and a predator, child killer, or cannibal at worst.<br /><br />Not that Warner lets children off easily: like Camille Paglia, Warner refuses to see children as essentially benign, innocent, and tender-hearted. Warner sees infancy in particular as a time of \\"unappeasable demands and violent greed,\\" behavior which, by a strange but spontaneous circularity, is often the very behavior by which \\"ogres and giants--and cannibal witches\\" are defined. Thus, part of the reason such tales exist and are read to impressionable children is because the stories teach their young audiences to recognize and reject their own worst personal and social inclinations.<br /><br />Does the human need to eat, and thus destroy other life at some level, result in a continuous but little realized psychic cycle of guilt, self-loathing, anxiety, and horror for mankind, especially when commingled with incestuous familial entanglements?  Are we all 'monsters' of some kind at some level? In a hilarious but acute look at the present-day \\"American identity,\\" the author perceives many Americans as \\"pillowy and flaccid and fluffy and fat, like babies,\\" members of a \\"generalized cult of childishness, a widespread, let's pretend infantilism\\" which \\"then fosters the image of the monster babies: they  have something which we lack, which we desire. Baby envy has eclipsed penis envy.\\"<br /><br />Warner also deftly illustrates how Freud's Oedipal theory, in which the young male child secretly desires to destroy the father with whom he feels competitive, is the direct inverse of the ogre's desire to devour his children and thus, Kronos-like, eliminate any competition his offspring may represent in the years to follow. Thus while the son, partially projecting a sense of his own unacceptable instincts, sees the father as the \\"child-guzzler,\\" the father may perceive his child as a life-sucking parasite that may rob him of his future, drain away his vitality, and one day assume his place and position if something isn't done to prevent it.<br /><br />The profusely illustrated 'No Go The Bogeyman' features wonderfully erudite commentary on an enormous number of diverse subjects, including the myths surrounding Kronos, the Cyclops, Scylla, and Circe, Goethe's poem 'The Erkling,' the artwork of Goya, Hieronymus Bosch, Caravaggio, Jacque-Louis David, William Hogarth, Gustave Dore, Richard Dadd, and Henri Rousseau, Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books, Dante's Divine Comedy, Punch & Judy shows, Beatrix Potter's 'The Tale of Samuel Whiskers,' Maurice Sendak's 'Where the Wild Things Are,' 1933's 'King Kong,' Bigfoot legends in America, David Lynch's 'Blue Velvet' (1986), Josephine Baker, Carmen Miranda, Halloween celebrations, and Carnival.some level?

Each day begins with Harry, Ron, and Hermione checking the obituary section of the newspaper for familiar names. Death Eaters are murdering people and Voldemort's return grows nearer. Teenage drama occurs between the main characters and this includes love and hate. The biggest shock of the entire series lies within the last couple chapters of this book.       This was the best Harry Potter book yet! J.K. Rowling's style is like no other. Her description of the setting and characters in this book is just amazing. No matter where she takes you in her books you can picture yourself there. When I read her books I see the Hogwarts castle, Hogsmeade, and the Forbidden Forrest in my mind. Each setting she creates evokes a different emotion. When Harry is at the Dursely's house you feel his isolation and loneliness. Then when he arrives at Hogwarts or the Burrow you too feel his sense of belonging. Rowling's ability to write round characters is also outstanding. Each of them has depth and significance. You come to know her characters and start predicting their reactions to the situations she creates in the story. You also start predicting what will happen with the characters in the next book. Harry, of course, is the most developed character. I love Rowling's books because you really see Harry Potter grow up. From book one to this you see his personality evolve. His humor changes, he starts to form views on issues, and he experiences new emotions and the whole time it feels as though you're experiencing them with him. J.K. Rowling's style is very unique and not like anyone else's. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a must read as well as the rest of the Harry Potter series.	2005-10-12

It's an intriguing hook because Nyswaner has been highly successful as the screenwriter for Philadelpia and other award-winning movies, so of course we'd love to read about his rock-bottom days, right?  The book isn't really about Nyswaner's self-destruction, though--it is a tribute to the teetotaling larger-than-life male prostitute who comes into Nyswaner's life for less than a year.  This book is the tale of Nyswaner's friendship with a man he pays for sex, sex which he can only have when he is strung out on drugs.  The book's prologue opens with the hustler's death, so from the minute we enter Nyswaner's life, we know their time is limited.<br /><br />As a reader, I was touched by Nyswaner's addiction, his search for himself, his continual attempts to find happiness through chemicals, and his devotion to the hustler Johann.  There's a beautiful story in here, even if Nyswaner's relationship with Johann was mostly one-sided.  Highly recommended.	2005-10-12

This is his story. One more in the long line of wrestler 'autobiographies' that are perpetually filling the market based on the success of Mick Foley's own story. Some of them a very good, others are very bad. This one leans more to the good side.<br /><br />Regal comes from a small town in England and is introduced to wrestling by his grandfather William. Regal begins his wrestling career at age 16 and spends his early years travelling the United Kingdom for the few promoters there. He fills in some quaint stories of his past and his comrades that he gets on with. He expands into the European market and does some local shows for then WWF and WCW when they went to England.<br /><br />He spends a good portion of the book covering his addiction to painkillers, alcohol, and enhancers but only briefly mentions use of cocaine. You must applaud his wife for sticking with him with the hell he puts forth in the way he treated people during this time. He briefly covers the forced landing of an airplane due in part to his drunkness. He mentions he was not the only problem on the plane but is also very careful throughout the book to not degrade any other personalities or throw out dirt stories on his colleagues.<br /><br />The book then moves on to his arrival into American wrestling with WCW and later the WWF/E. Surprisingly, he spends very little time rehashing matches and storylines once he hits the \\"bigtime\\". He throws in some anecdotes regarding Ric Flair, Paul \\"Triple H\\" Levesque, Fit Finlay, Goldberg, and others. It's almost missing something because he mentions his favorite match he ever had (vs Edge) but doesn't go into why it's his favorite.<br /><br />All in all, the book is solid but not outstanding. He does get personal in his drug use and rehab. Regal throws in his English verbage/syntax to help add flavor and personalize the story (he includes a glossary for the terms also). He also tries to establish that there is a serious difference between him as Darren Matthews and his character persona of the snooty blue-blooded Steven William Regal (much the same as Missy Hyatt/Melissa Hiat did in her book). The biggest annoyance of the book is the quote blurbs that fill multiple pages or parts of pages (they are backgrounded by a Union Jack). I've always taken quote blurbs to be a spot where an important point is being made, but these just seem to be random picks to be offset for no apparent reason.<br /><br />It's certainly not the best 'autobiography' by a wrestler, but there are certainly worse ones. Either way, it's a fast read and much less costly than some of the other wrestler's books (I think I bought mine new for $16 at Barnes & Noble)terms also).

Tom Wright gives us a highly readable and quite enjoyable introduction to the gospel of Mark, informed by both his deep New Testament scholarship and his wide pastoral experience and perspective.  This is Mark, truly for everyone. While there won't be much here that is new for those well-acquainted with current NT research, Wright plainly illuminates Mark's themes and places them properly in the context of the times.  Wright's own translations of the original text are clear and contemporary to the right degree.  For his intended audience - the general educated reader - Wright is on target.  This would be a good pick for a teen or adult NT study group.  Read it, and your faith will be even better secured on a firm foundation of understanding.  Wright knows how to go after the very core, the kernel, of faith. <br /> <br />Reading it, it is easy to hear Tom Wright's baritone voice in his adept prose; he is so effortless to read that it is easy to overlook how good a writer he in fact is.  The medium is properly transparent and subordinate to the message. <br /> <br />This series reminds me of the one authored years ago by William Barclay; each author has his own strengths and appeal and both could be read with profit by the Christian wishing to better understand the New Testament.  If I had to recommend just one, it would be Wright, without question.  But that would be to ignore the often top-notch pastoral sermon aspects - albeit old-fashioned- of Barclay's writings.	2005-10-12

I say musical wallpaper because it smacked of country, of the recently immigrated.  I prefered instead R&B.  Later, I preferred anything (ragas, jazz, American folk, soul, tropical) other than the music that Elijah Wald writes about.  After visiting Mexico several times as an adult and hearing rancheras and pop and cumbia, the feeling for the music of Mexico began to grow.  After reading Mr. Wald's book I realized that I had ignored a genre of music that had, in fact, been a part of my life from the beginning. Read this book and then buy the music.  If you are learning Spanish as a second language, you can generally find the lyrics on-line.  There is no better way (short of taking a Mexican lover) to learn and love this beautiful language.  The book is well-written, well-reasearched, and will open your musical mind.	2005-10-12

I mean, first of all, the title is exactly what this book is about \\"Things Every Skier Must Know\\".  Finally, a book that lives up to its title!  Daaamn!  This book is quite unique in that it does not teach you ski technique or ski mechanics or ski maintenance...just way, way too many of these books.  Instead, this book teaches you stuff...really useful, practical stuff like how to hook up your skis on your car rack...the right way!  Or how to look for a well-qualified ski instructor - believe me, this is not an easy task to do!  I've taken so many ski lessons and ended up with so many bad ski instructors, it's not even funny and I pretty much had to learn skiing on my own.  There is also great advice on how to prepare for a ski vacation and some brief notes on skiing on various terrains and even a chapter on ski racing!  This book ponders on almost every aspect of skiing but the kitchen sink (What does that have to do with skiing, you wonder...absolutely nothing).  I highly recommend this book.  It is a great read on the plane or long trips to the ski resort.

The story of Nick Leeson and the collapse of Barings happened 10 years ago, but it continues to hold my imagination.  Perhaps I had been captivated by Barings' former mystique.  Stephen Fay's book is well researched and may be the best of the \\"Barings\\" books (I have not yet read the others).  It appears to be a well balanced account which takes in what (the hell) Leeson says he was up to and compares it against the official investigations, observations of others in the firm, and adds a dash of common sense, in an attempt to try to provide a total picture of the debacle. <br /> <br />One thread running through Fay's book is the weakness of Barings' control systems; the Bank was apparently attempting to enter the 21st century with 19th century risk management techniques.  Another subtext is that a lot of the successful management alchemy that had driven Barings in its Victorian heyday had been bred out of the firm by the time Nick entered the picture, so that top executives lacked the necessary antennae to tune into or uncover the risks which Leeson was exposing them to.  I admit there is a lot of strength to the argument that there was a lot of willful ignorance going on with all of Leeson's fake profits to prop up the bottom line, as Fay says: <br /> <br />\\"Greed is the easiest of the...motives to understand.  In the old days, most of the Baring family - especially those who worked in the bank - were very comfortably off.  Their motives were a blend of influence in [London], social position and a bit of public service.  The clerks were not greedy because they were in no position to be.  Big Bang in 1985 altered that, and the fast growth of derivatives markets in the late 1980s changed it beyond recognition.  Having transferred their last shares to the Baring Foundation, the directors now relied on bonuses to earn good money.  But much of the firm's profit now depended on the people who had once formed the function of the clerks.\\"...like Leeson, who was on his way upfrom that station. <br /> <br />A strength of the Fay text is that it is completely devoid of a tabloid approach to the whole topic.  There are not even any pictures, certainly not of Lisa Leeson in tears, unless you count Nick in handcuffs on the dust jacket (I am also excepting photocopies of memos and faxes, which are informative).  This book is written with an organization that an auditor could love, and apprentices at the major securities trading firms of the world could do worse than read this book on their first day of employment. <br /> <br />Perhaps it doesn't matter looking back that the Bank of England failed to bail Barings out; I hope that the folk once employed there have gradually made their way in the world, I even hope the (still married?) Nick & Lisa have sorted out their lives.  Barings seems like an antique, a fine piece of China that finally fell off a shelf and shattered.  It could have been different, if Christopher Heath's trading culture had been better melded with the Bank's stuffy side; if they had, earlier on, spent GBP 10 million on that fancy new trading system called BRAINS (and figured out Nick before he figured out how to hack it); if they had roused themselves earlier to investigate various holes in their trading accounts and tracked down the origin of the SLK receivable.  If only, if only, if only...  Such are the decisions of life.	2005-10-12

I found the book to be riddled with errors and typos (for example, the bottom of page 293 shows an example property with an 8% LTV (!!)) and it is a bit dated, however, the use of a CDROM to show examples and a trial ARGUS program is nice.  One major problem is that the numerous problems outlined at the end of each chapter are never answered in the book.  Thus, the poor student hoping to check to see if his homework answers are correct is out of luck.  The case study at the end of the book, the capstone project I assume, is an appraisal of an apartment complex.  As users of ARGUS know, an apartment complex cannot be modeled well in ARGUS.  The authors should have known that, and its clear that they are out of touch with how real appraisals are done.  Overall, I'd say its a typical sloppy textbook written by academics with little to no knowledge of the real world....	2005-10-12

This book has been especially useful for a university paper I was working on. It passed some time since that but the concepts I read are still fresh in my memory, since it were concepts I've been suspicious for a long time. One might think that the author forced a note in affirming the male dominance is caused by the male \\"impotence\\", but if you take an impartial look you'll find he is right. Don't get me wrong: I have no problems in beeing a man, but I'm honest enough to recognize that the western world is based on a patriarchal figure, on a concept of a man that needs constantly to prove to himself and to others that he is no woman, that he is not a sissy or a gay - wich is even worse -, but, on the contrary, that he is a real macho, a sex machine that can \\"score\\" as many women as he wants since they are so inferior that they get completely overwhelmed by his mere presence. It's sad but it's the reality. <br />Fortunately, things are changing. In Spain we had notice of the first girl (she's 16) that joined a senior male soccer team as an advancee. In Germany, Angela Merkel is the first woman to be nominated chancelor. In the great majority of western countries, the armed forces do accept equally male and female recruits. <br />It reminds me the movie of 007 \\"Goldeneye\\", when the Admiral said to M (a woman) that she didn't had the \\"balls\\" to stand in face of the situation, to wich she replied that she had the advantage of not having to be thinking with them all the time... <br />It would be nice if in the future our leaders will think less with the \\"balls\\" and more with the brains...	2005-10-12

I have read with concern some of the reviews on this book.

This book offers great advice on what otherwise has often seemed difficult to do; saving consistently & investing wisely.  <br /> <br />Whether you are leveraging time or money, the analogy of the power behind the Pipeline is a welcome reprieve to many people. From those who are making the transition from full time jobs to doing their own business, those learning to set up their own businesses, and those in investment clubs investing in building big businesses, those who are planning to retire early and want a successful future and have never known how to do it, as well as the ignorant and plainly niave.  <br /> <br />It is a must read! especially because of the candid and vivid examples it gives. On the one hand, legendary successful families like the Vanderbilt's, Firestones, Fords, Rockefellers, and on the other hand people who have showed restraint and discipline like  Pablo, the small time elementary school teacher the Dentist who got arthritis and Bruno.   <br /> <br />Just read it, live your dreams and let the sceptics and sleeping dogs lie.	2005-10-12

But is this poet well understood, and are her birthdays and other important dates even recognized other than by those already devoted to her? One editorial reviewer for Amazon of the Cambridge Companion makes a key mistake-stating that she is one of our most important \\"19th Century poets.\\"  No--Dickinson is one of the two most important American poets in all our literature-of whatever century, and most likely including this new one- the other candidate for top honors being Walt Whitman. Arguably, Dickinson is the more important of the two given the resonance in our later poetry with the depth of her interior, private vision. Whitman aspired to be America's great public bard-a project Robert Pinsky and others have pointed out that did not succeed (see my Amazon review of Pinsky's Democracy, Culture and the Voice of Poetry). But Dickinson's intense private vision is more responsible than Whitman's public one for generating followers and inspiring others. Wallace Stevens and Hart Crane are two examples. With rare exceptions, American poetry has developed more along the lines suggested by her more private vision and voice than it has to the broad, public sweep of Whitman's long-windedness.    Everyone more or less knows who Dickinson is, and most educated persons have probably read at least one of her poems. But, do we grasp what a deep treasure trove Dickinson has left us? Do we get beyond the superficial portrait most have of her? And most importantly, how do we access the wealth of creativity and insight that lies beyond the few dozen or so most popular Dickinson poems most of us are familiar with?    Wendy Martin's Cambridge Companion to Emily Dickinson is a great place to start broadening our view of her. The war over Dickinson's manuscripts (today part still belong to Harvard and part to Amherst College) and for defining her as a person is something that happened shortly after she died and was caused by a schism of sorts in her family when her brother, Austin Dickinson, took a lover, Mabel Loomis Todd, outside of his marriage to Emily's beloved friend, companion and lifelong correspondent, Susan Dickinson. This is a really racy story!   It is ably narrated in Betsy Erkkila's essay \\"The Emily Dickinson Wars.\\"    Christopher Benfey's essay \\"Emily Dickinson and the American South,\\" is also remarkable. How do you explain the fact that Dickinson wrote throughout the Civil War, Emancipation, etc. and has almost nothing to say about these huge events? While not a Southern sympathizer, there is much in her work that accords with the agrarian, aristocratic elements in American life that was also represented in the South and its literature, and she fit the sensibility of those who yearned for a pre-Industrial America in the 20th Century quite well-although it doesn't really fully define her to see it in this way.    Wendy Martin's own essay on Dickinson's poetic strategies is a strong overview of how some of the larger elements in Dickinson's life worked themselves out in her verse, including her deeply meaningful relationship with her sister-in-law.  Martin is very strong on her analysis of the poetic use of words like \\"sun\\" which appears so often in the poems, and she sees Dickinson as one who revels with her volcanic creativity in night and darkness. It's a luxurious image and picture of her.    I have to confess that, though our last names are the same, I am no relation to Emily Dickinson. Starting when I was a very young child, my mother (who grew up not far from Amherst in a similar setting) read her to me frequently, and I was somewhat confused about the name.  For quite some time I thought when my mother said we were \\"not related\\" that we really were related. I felt the poems were something that had been written to us, like letters from a relative, which were also sometimes read aloud to the family. I was disappointed to learn that \\"no relation\\" actually meant we weren't related-and somehow before figuring it out got some of the deeper messages even as a very young child -it was as though they had been meant especially for me and sent from a kindred soul.       One suggestion for how to celebrate Emily Dickinson's birthday each December 10th is to read this book and others like it-and to re-encounter Dickinson's poems over and over.  They richly repay our efforts to understand and enjoy them.	2005-10-12

Instead of (like cults), getting you to turn off your brain and hand your money and your life to some glorious leader, they take that same power and get you to take your life back from alchohol or whatever destructive behavior you have.  Mind control if very powerful, and so are drugs and alchohol.  I am grateful that I found the 12-steps.	2005-10-12

John McMurtry, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada, does not hesitate to compare the capitalism with a cancerous ulcer. The greed conducts the processes of the capital accumulations -- and will not lead to sensible, ethically acceptable investments, but causes a dying of the planet like a tumor can start the fall of a human body. There are to show a lot of short-sightedness -- from the seabed up to the ozone layer, from weapons trade to waste of fuel and medicine by few ruthless nations. To ignore these matters is similar, indeed, like ignoring growing tumors and hoping with optimism, that there never will be any need of consulting a doctor. More and more money for useless investors is demanded by capital owners, unfortunately, a mentality of \\"predation\\" would not come into disrepute at all. However, this is the effort which makes McMurtry to himself with his publications: understanding the global markets and resources as an ethical task. So McMurtry interprets some famines caused by U.S. economy sanctions -- in Cuba, Somalia, Iraq or North Korea. A hoarding of resources (to be called almost lecherously) by only few privileged ones infuriates in principle the Canadian philosopher. He stands up vehemently for an ethic, which does not consider only humane justice, but also a sudden close-out sale of our planet. In an earlier age religious authorities denied that the earth revolves around the sun, nowadays management groups steered by lobbyists deny that an economic egoism is a depressing illness. Economy policy as in a egocentric, blind rage could tip over sometime and come fast to a precipice unpleasantly. Dying by the way is not painless. The global illness harbingers are homelessness, poverty, crime, terrorism, refugee misery (from Mexico to Morocco). The morphine of not to mention it -- is like ignoring hospital, if it is needed.	2005-10-12

The DSM is now - and always has been - a political document, and a Medicare nightmare. The American Psychiatric Association's first attempt to catalog mental disorders under the nomenclature of DSM, had to be revised at once. The APA's assertion that Homosexuality fell within the domain occupied by Child Molestors, and Sexual Deviates was met with intense criticism by any right thinking people. Thus, the original DSM was revised for an emergency 2nd Printing! This singular event was unheard of. A manual as important as the DSM, wasn't even defended by it's governing body? What were they trying to do? Maybe they were hoping to mollify Homo-phobes, or promote castration, or accepting a bribe, or sell drugs... Anything but the truth - whether homosexuality is innate, or by choice, it does not share a foundation with sex offenders. And very interesting is the American Psychiatric Association's refusal to consider scientific findings from Psychologists. As Psychologists have nothing to gain by subverting science, and thus are far better explorers of human behavior, it is them who should author any such tome. But the Physicians lock them out. After all, science doesn't help Physicians sell drugs. Innuendo does. More, the DSM presents as a political document, that conveys the current zeitgeist regarding human behavior. Thus, what's a symptom yesterday, is healthy today (consider Narcissim I). Self-Defeating Personalty Disorder? How 'bout poor judgement instead? As a clinical tool, the DSM (IV-TR) is rubbish. I geuss one has to give up independent thought, and live in a virtual Stepford, to be INELIGIBLE for Social Security Disability (and then Medicare). Neatly packaged garbage, from the cowardly minds of garbageheads who call themselves Psychiatrists. Yuuuch!	2005-10-12

HA! HA!\\" from every room of the house. I couldn't put it down because it felt so good to laugh. I've decided it's a much easier route to six-pack abs than sit-ups.

We may feel like we're the only one dealing with certain behavior issues -- single parents, especially, may have no one who can share the burden. But a book like this one helps fill in the gaps.<br /><br />This would make a great gift for any Dad - but I know moms will love it too. Bete lets you peek into his house and show you how he turns those moments of \\"Uh-oh\\" (the tooth fairy forgot to visit...) into moments of \\"Ah-ha! Close your eyes and she'll leave you a surprise\\" (It may even be money...or other unknown contents from a rapidly emptied pocket!)<br /><br />I can't tell you how hard I laughed when Tim described what it's like to change a baby's diaper in an airplane bathroom. Yes, I've done it! Most parents can relate to the strange places you're forced to do such a chore.<br /><br />And how insane we feel when we have to read the same book over and over (AND OVER) again. \\"I tried sliding it under a chair cushion,\\" he writes about his son wanting to hear The Lion King every time his wife had a prenatal visit. \\"But no matter where I hid it, it always appeared at the top of the book pile at our next visit.\\" To this day, \\"Hakuna Matata\\" sends shivers up his spine \\"as if I heard the sound of fingernails on a chalkboard.\\"<br /><br />If you're a group leader for any kind of parent organization, this book would be great to have for a break-the-ice reading or gift for new members.

Filled with literally thousands of facts and figures, this is the hard-hitting and hilarious indictment of Republicans that I have long been waiting for.  Reilly exposes the true Republican agenda, how Democrats can attack it, and gives no quarter.  It explains how to win, strategic issues, offers a Red State Strategy, and explains how to save Social Security without raising taxes or cutting benefits.  After reading it, I've concluded that Bush is not a true Republican, a true Conservative, or a true Christian.  Anyone pissed at Bush or the Republicans will love this book.  It's got more zingers than Dolly Madison.  The first chapter, the Table of Contents, and more quotes can be found at the author's website.  Excerpts from the back cover: <br /> <br />\\"Republicans believe that if you enjoy sex, you are doing it wrong.  Bush fought a war on poverty and the poor lost.  Republicans follow the Bible until it gets to Jesus.  Cheney called the new Miss America unpatriotic because she wished for world peace.  With great power comes great responsibility -- unless you're Republican.  Bush dances around the truth so well that rappers are ripping off his moves.  If the dollar falls any further, Bush will have to peg it to the peso.  America fought a war with Iraq and Halliburton won.  The only time Republicans talk to blacks is when they challenge them at the polls.  Bush's foreign policy is so retarded it needs a special bus.  Is it just me, or does Tom Delay look like a big, fat Adolf Hitler without the mustache? The voter always wins -- unless Republicans get their way.  Bush is responsible for enough disasters to qualify for scripture.  He may not follow the Commandments, but he's pretty good at the plagues.  Bush hasn't choked this much since his last pretzel. A Republican future is so bleak that their only approval numbers are coming from Gothic fans.  Bush is slow making decisions because he first waits for the check to clear.  Republicans are backing off Social Security cuts so fast that they are practically moonwalking.   Why is Bush so weak?  Because knowledge is power.\\" <br />	2005-10-12

First off, for a Doctor Who novel, it was average.  It was true to the character of the 9th Doctor (for those of you in the States, trust me on this), and there weren't any painfully embarressing scenes where the Doctor goes completely out of his mind.  Secondly, it had a decent story, a tad predictable, but it managed not to have gaping plot holes. <br /> <br />This is a book to read on the train, airport, or during a rainy afternoon.  While it's not the best that English literature has to offer, it will put you in the middle of a Doctor Who episode for a few hours. <br /> <br />And really, what else do you read these books for anyway??	2005-10-12

I've read this book some years back and what an eye-opener! Throughout my years of being in school, starting with the first time I stepped into one at around the tender age of four, I always felt there was something not right about the place we call school. Since reading this book, I finally understood what I was trying to get at when I would tell my mother \\"school is torture\\", \\"school is boring and stupid\\", and other such unsophisticated ways of expressing what this system that I was told was for my own good was really doing to me. It tends to be worse if, like myself, you were in special education. In there, they trump up your disabilities, label you, and make your situation sound so much worse than it really is.  <br /> <br />I was someone who never really went along with teachers' wishes simply because I found the curriculum boring and uninteresting in addition to the fact that a lot of times I never got a single drop of human respect from them. As a result I was tagged as being lazy, uncooperative, unable to follow directions and a list of other names I care not to get into. What I felt they never understood about me was that I'm a very independent learner. I quickly found out that they didn't want independent learners. They wanted intellectual dependence from their students. You learn THEIR way or face the consequences. I noticed in my experiences that they often tried to undermine my mother or otherwise keep her out of the equation. Sometimes by doing things that were underhanded or even illegal. <br /> <br />While this book paints a lofty picture of history and despite Mr. Gatto's party affiliation (which in my opinion should be irrelevent...you can still learn from this book), it does present in a concise form what is wrong with our schools. However, the deterioration of our \\"education\\" system is part of a larger social-economic-political problem. Any school ran by the government is going to have an agenda. Be it in service of the state's agenda (read not necessarily good for you) or a corporate sponsored agenda. <br /> <br />For those who said that Mr. Gatto gave no solutions to the problems he describes, the scope of the book is not about the solutions. I believe you'll find the documentation and solutions in his other book. It is important to include in the solution that not every parent is fit to teach and not everyone has a teriffic homelife. As the old saying goes, \\"it takes a village to raise a child\\". Keep in mind that a lot of these parents were graduates of the very same system Gatto shreds to pieces. It is important to have a thriving and involved community but to a child, there's nothing more important than a loving and involved parent. There's no replacement for that.  <br /> <br />Overall, this book was very informative and very helpful to me. It's quite an illumination and validated me and my feelings. I got a personal sense of satisfaction from this book because I realized in a very short amount of time after high school, I learned more than I ever did in those 12 years and I did it on my own without the help of \\"experts\\" telling me I wasn't good enough to learn on my own. I also learned that the things that happened in those 12 years weren't necessarily my own fault. I felt imensely validated by this book and realized that I am not and never was crazy or a bad person because I refused to be obedient just for the sake of being obedient. <br /> <br />I totally recommend this book because it allows you to see the problems and take the appropriate steps to do more research on it and do something about it.	2005-10-12

Plus, I don't think she applies the same level of high-mindedness to herself as she does to other people.  She seems to like to cut down trees but then complains later about flooding from upgradient homeowners that have cut down their trees.  Also, she drowns possums.  She complains that she raises her food to live on and she can't spare any to varmints.  I'm not sure what she thinks the possum was eating the food for.  I suspect to live on.

I know very little about horses and thought I would be in over my head, but I was hooked from page 1. The relationship between this mysterious horse and his groom is told with fierce, humane intelligence. I will never look at a horse the same ever again. This writer's knowledge of equine behavior is mesmerizing. The historical drama is beautifully paced. Just when I'd had enough gore and battle, there I was in the serenity of a beautiful stable heaped with barley. Just when I'd had enough desert, I was in a stream. Just when I needed to get off this putrid boat, there I was in an English meadow. I see movie written all over this book -- the instincts of the Turkish groom, the intelligence of the English gentleman and the soul of this 17th century horse, played out against  a violent and vibrant ancient world. Finally a book about destiny. Tired of the usual domestic urban or suburban drama? So was I.	2005-10-12

So if you want to know where to get a scholarly view on 'once saved always saved' from the baptists, methodists and a host of other groups he gives you that in short list form.  For that alone the book is an unusual resource.<br /><br />Most theological books don't attempt to impact your devotional life...and can be dry.  Not Grudem...he gives meditation scriptures and a song/hymn for personal worship.  This book is just a great book.<br /><br />Some of the topics can be taken in an outline form and filled in with illustrations...they preach very well when used like this.  For example...his article on 'Final Judgment' is one that preaches well.  Just make sure to give him credit if doing that.<br /><br />Also-this book can provide a great start for research into a topic.<br /><br />I think all ministers of the gospel should consult this book regularly.

Although the word hadn't yet entered everyday language when William James published Pragmatism in 1907, the philosopher believed its doctrine had virtually become common sense in twentieth-century America.  For James, pragmatism was a specific philosophical alternative to essentialism and foundationalism and argued that ideas are meaningful only insofar as they have practical consequences in concrete human experience; however today pragmatism has come to denote merely a general willingness to compromise principles, even to the point of selfishness or irresponsibility.  Written in an engaging and accessible style, Pragmatism is a valuable corrective to modern uses of the word, since the voice that speaks in its pages embodies precisely the opposite values from the pejorative senses the word has acquired.\\"	2005-10-12

Very few authors could pull off a story like this with the finesse of Jennifer Fulton. I doubt many would be brave enough to try knowing they are liable to have it condemned by the thought police, irrespective of the quality or sensitivity of the writing.  <br />I saw on this author's website that she wrote it in response to requests for a spring autumn romance. My first love-the love of my life, was a woman twenty-four years older than myself, and I was fortunate to be with her until her death.  <br />Love can happen to women of very different ages and be consensual and wonderful, which is exactly how Ms. Fulton depicts it in this sweet and delicious romance. I would give it more stars if possible.  It touched me and brought back some very happy memories of the partner I've lost, whose age was no more relevant than her shoe size. Kudos to you Ms. Fulton for boldly going where most of our writers don't have the talent to go and for bringing your readers yet another unique, original, warm-hearted romance. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

I believe that Mr. Maguire probably wrote this to show another side to the story of Cinderella.   <br /> As you can probably tell by the title of the book, it is written in the point of view of one of the \\"ugly\\"stepsisters, named Iris. The story begins with the sisters and their mother leaving England and trying to find some family that they have in Germany.  Their family is gone and they have nowhere to go.  They come across an artist and his apprentice and they stay with them and cook and clean for them in exchange for a place to stay and food to eat.  Later, that artist must paint a portrait of a beautiful young girl.  As the story evolves the sisters and their mother go to work for a wealthy man who is the father of this young girl named Clara.  Clara becomes the cinder girl and the story moves on, making all of the Cinderella stories you've ever heard fly out the window.   <br /> In a historical point of view, the story is very accurate to the extent of my knowledge.  I found that very interesting.  He made it feel like I was in Germany during this time period.  It was very well written.  It was very descriptive.  Gregory Maguire is a very good writer.  Gregory Maguire does a great job with imagery. <br /> I really enjoyed reading this book.  The changes that the writer made to it really made my perception of Cinderella change.  I enjoyed hearing Iris' point of view on everything that happened.  I loved the fact that Maguire gives you the opportunity to meet Clara's mother and learn what she is like.   <br /> Although I enjoyed the story immensely, there were a couple of things that I didn't like about it.  I really did not like the fact that it is written in present tense.  At first, it was a very big deal to me, because it started somewhat slowly (the other thing that I didn't like about the book).  Once I started getting really in to the book, I didn't notice it anymore. <br /> Iwould most definitely recommend this book to anyone who would like to hear a bit of a different perspective of the story.  Reading Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister made me want to read the other books that Gregory Maguire wrote, changing the point of view of a classic tale.	2005-10-12

Reviewer: Waldir Freitas Oliveira (Salvador, Bahia, Brazil)	On purpose  of commemorating the fourth centenary of the birth of the Spanish dramatist Tirso de Molina, the Department of Modern Language and Literature of The Catholic University of America, sponsored a so-called The International Symposium on Tirso de Molina, which was organized by Dr. Joseph M. Sola-Sol, assistant professor, and took place in Washington D.C. in November 1988. One of the academic byproducts of that event is the volume Tirso's Dons Juan, Metamorphoses of a Theme, edited bu Joseph M. Sola-Sol and George E. Gingras, associate professor, and published in Washington D.C. The Catholic University of America, 1988. It assembles numerous scholary contributions then presented by well-known specialists in Hispanic Literature, although dealing with a single and specific the: Don Juan, the character and theatrical personage. As such, this book remains referred to as rare collection of high quality level studies on the subject.  <br />I'ts hard task to distinguish any of the thirteen articles selected for this publication, because each one or them is worth enough to be summed up as unique in the meaningful conjoint of texts. A relevant theme as Tirso de Molina and his provocative personage, Don Juan, justify the value of this book as a whole. DThe erudition of the authors of the articles assembled by the book constitutes, as ma matter of fact, the most efficient factor for its success in the realm of literature, along with the appropriate viewpoints and approache adopted by the authors for analyzing and understanding the Spanish dramaturgical creation of Don Juan, undoubtedly one of the most famous characters os hero-villain of the world literature. In this book the article \\"The present state of Studies on the Don Juan\\", written by Armand Singer, of West Virginia University, deserves a special mention for having presented the most complete bibliography ever inlisted on the theme, and amplified after his research-book \\"The Don Juan Theme, Versions and Criticism: a Bibliography\\" (Morgantown, West Virginia Univesity Press, 1965) and is subsequent \\"Supplements\\", all of them published in the WVUPP, in 1966, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1975, 1980 and 198. The article \\"Some Observations on the Generic Status of the Don Juan Theme from Tirso de Molina to Mozart\\", signed by George E.Gingras, an associate professor of the Department of Modern Language and Literature of the Catholic University of America, by examining the problem of generic displacement performed by the theme in a variety of neoclassical dramatic and musical forms, also deserves another distinguishid mention.	2005-10-12

Characters range from the very nasty new crime boss to the good-guy-at-heart, John Mitcheson. The book is fast paced and action packed, and Gavin and Palmer make an unbeatable team. I look forward to reading the second book in this series, No Help for the Dying.	2005-10-12

The start of this book begins with a legend, the telling of a tale of a creature that assimilated into society and became what is known to them as \\"others\\" (which are human) the back story is important so do not skip. They live known as Chasen it is a shire (of sorts) and none of them are allowed to leave it, they are after all not human and tend to keep to themselves only going out into the \\"others world\\" when necessary and to keep the suspicion down. They also from time to time have situations where someone does escape the shire, these people are referred to as {{runners}}} it is the job of the council (and namely Kit) to track down these \\"Drakons\\" and return them to the shire where they are dealt with by the council. \\"Drakon\\" can also sense each other, their power and energy, because they are creatures they can not have living livestock around as the animals sense their presence (don't forget they are also hunters) and react accordingly, hence they have no animals roaming free in the shire. Their \\"other\\" appearance is almost fairy-like meaning they are beautiful as humans.<br /><br />Kit (Christopher) is the Hero and the heir to his \\"kind\\" he is strong and VERY VERY Alpha male over the lapse of time there hasn't been a female \\"Drakon\\" born to them for centuries which has the council concerned and almost desperate. Clarissa (Rue) is a half-ling she is half human and half \\"Drakon\\" she is considered and treated as a outcast because of this growing up in the shire has not been easy on her, you can imagine that like all other women in the shire she has loved the \\"soon-to-be-someday\\" leader of their tribe from a far for as long as she can remember. On Clarissa 17th birthday she \\"turns\\" and discovers that's she is indeed the one and only ALPHA FEMALE. Time passes and the story skips ahead to a thief in London that disappears into thin air and the tabloids are having a field day with it because this thief has stolen several times and never has anyone REALLY seen this culprit of course the \\"Drakon\\" who keeps watchful eyes out sees the story knows that it is one of their own a decision is made to bait the thief out.<br /><br />The \\"Drakon\\" has a treasure (which is described in detail in the prologue) that is the \\"heart\\" of their existence it is a Purple diamond this diamond is kept deep, deep in the Earth back in Chasen, but is known as the \\"Langford Jewel\\" all around the world. A decision is made to bring this diamond to London to be put on display at a museum ... a bait to lure the thief out. Clarissa is a master of disguises she does attend the museum exhibit Kit senses her (but doesn't realize that the person whom they are seeking is a female).<br /><br />I won't say much more than this don't want to give away spoilers :) but I will say this..... The story is full of EVERYTHING that appeals to a romance reader Kit is sexy, has a sense of humor, smart and protective of Rue. Rue is beautiful, witty, strong (she can fence) and a compliment to Kit's ALPHA MALE. Science Fiction/Fantasy readers will like it simply because of the different element of the supernatural fans of {{{Christine Feehan, Linda K.

Rue is like what Elena is to the werewolf community in the Kelley Armstrong \\"Women of the Otherworld Series\\" , Kit is very much so like the Carpathian men in the Christine Feehan \\"Dark Series\\" or the men in the \\"Dark-Hunter Series\\" of Kenyon. The experience and thrill of being a \\"Drakon\\" is very reminiscent  of the \\"passion\\" in the Donna Boyd \\"Werewolf\\" books. Ms. Abe wrote such a good book that I long to go back to the pages and re-read as if it was my first time again about Rue and Kit, if you are new to Ms. Abe's writing I would also recommend checking out her \\"The Last Mermaid\\" very well written and a definitely and different twist on the whole mermaid folklore.<br /><br />Respectfully Reviewedulprit of course the \\"Drakon\\" who keeps watchful eyes out sees the story knows that it is one of their own a decision is made to bait the thief out.  <br /> <br />The \\"Drakon\\" has a treasure (which is described in detail in the prologue) that is the \\"heart\\" of their existence it is a Purple diamond this diamond is kept deep, deep in the Earth back in Chasen, but is known as the \\"Langford Jewel\\" all around the world.

So many of the technological advances that science fictions writers try to predict or possibly more often, hope will come true, miss the mark in the time of the setting.  The fantastic space station, that may have seemed so plausable in 30 years is hard to conceive of to exist in even 100 years from now, considering the expense of such things and the consistent statement of the populace uninterested in space: \\"we should spend the money here on earth.\\"  Although there are some elements of interest that come close to todays technology, such as instant access to information that's vaguely similar to the internet.  Probably the one thing that dates the book is its tackling an issue that was considered quite important at the time: overpopulation, which has virtually dropped off the face of the earth as a political topic.  Both political parties agree that overpopulation is an issue, so ironically if there is no party to disagree to ones belief, then there's no recrimination that can be thrown about, so the topic ceases to exist as a political topic.  Even more ironic, is that back in 1978, the author is creating this dismal futuristic world choked by overpopulation, and yet as the date of the setting approaches, the population of the world is really not that far off from this worse case scenario he envisions.  Which makes one wonder of this non-discussed issue even more, and upon such things as how the planet is able to support such a populace today, and agricultural efficiency and genetically modified foods that feed greater numbers of people from the same plot of land.  I have read that some groups do not wish to bring up overpopulation as an issue as it may be dictating to less developed countries, where the growth of population is greatest, to curb their population growth.  Several years ago, National Geographic highlighted what will be the most populated cities of the world by 2050 and one city stuck out: Lagos.  Now I know a bit of geography, but I had to go to the map to locate this city.  This book also takes a hard look at race relations in the US, so much so that it's hard to believe that it would be printed today, in fact it's hard to believe it was printed back in 1978.  Another tough social issue the author brings up is cloning and who or what does `the clone' belong to, which are ethical issues of today. <br /> <br />The world is basically separated into three main groups, the World Government (successor to the UN), multinational corporations really run by an oligarchy of five men, and a revolutionary movement.  The books deals with the twists and turns and collusions between these three groups.  This is an epic novel with several storylines that come together and a good sense of suspense that makes you want to continue reading to discover what happens.  3-1/2 stars.	2005-10-12

Hughes (the grandson of Lt. Col. John McKendrick Hughes) The Unwanted: Great War Letters From The Field is a compilation of the correspondences of an officer in the 151st Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force, whose unit reached Shorncliffe in late 1916 where he and the other company officers were bluntly informed by the British that they were \\"unwanted\\", officers deemed \\"surplus to the establishment\\". Determined to contribute to the war effort, Major John Hughes became on of three Corps Agricultural Officers with the British 2nd Army, charged with growing vegetables and other foodstuffs to feed the front line troops. The Unwanted is John's personal story, based on the letters he sent to his wife nearly every day for three and a half years -- and a superb contribution to the still expanding library of World War I personal memoirs and military biographies.	2005-10-12

Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) is considered one of the giants of philosophy, of his age or any other. It is largely this book that provides the foundation of this assessment. Whether one loves Kant or hates him (philosophically, that is), one cannot really ignore him; even when one isn't directly dealing with Kantian ideas, chances are great that Kant is made an impact.<br /><br />Kant was a professor of philosophy in the German city of Konigsberg, where he spent his entire life and career. Kant had a very organised and clockwork life - his habits were so regular that it was considered that the people of Konigsberg could set their clocks by his walks. The same regularity was part of his publication history, until 1770, when Kant had a ten-year hiatus in publishing. This was largely because he was working on this book, the 'Critique of Pure Reason'. He then published this second installment, 'Critique of Practical Reason', seven years later.<br /><br />Kant as a professor of philosophy was familiar with the Rationalists, such as Descartes, who founded the Enlightenment and in many ways started the phenomenon of modern philosophy. He was also familiar with the Empiricist school (John Locke and David Hume are perhaps the best known names in this), which challenged the rationalist framework. Between Leibniz' monads and Hume's development of Empiricism to its logical (and self-destructive) conclusion, coupled with the Romantic ideals typified by Rousseau, the philosophical edifice of the Enlightenment seemed about to topple.<br /><br />The foundations of this text (a much briefer one than the first Critique) can be found in the short volume 'Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals'. Whereas 'Groundwork' sets out some short, basic principles, the Critique is a more synthetic text - it takes these principles and combines them with experiences, then presenting them 'as the structure of a peculiar cognitive faculty, in their natural combination.'<br /><br />According to translator and scholar Lewis White Beck, this second Critique has two functions - it affirms concepts 'without which moral experience would be unintelligible or impossible' while it negates dogmatism and fanaticism that claims unique ultimate insight into metaphysical realities. Kant does make his argument for the existence of the immortal soul and for God in this volume, but these are considered lesser areas of Kant's competence. His discussion of freedom and autonomy, carried forward from his discussion in 'Groundwork', is much more studied and used in today's philosophical circles.structure of a peculiar cognitive faculty, in their natural combination.'  <br /> <br />According to translator and scholar Lewis White Beck, this second Critique has two functions - it affirms concepts 'without which moral experience would be unintelligible or impossible' while it negates dogmatism and fanaticism that claims unique ultimate insight into metaphysical realities.

It not only covers the basics in chess, but also deals with some of the philosophical ideas that one might apply to chess playing.  This is a creative synthesis by authors Michael Gelb and Raymond Keene of the teachings of Samurai warriors and the basic layout of chess - an intriguing idea, given the martial nature of chess playing.<br /><br />Chess can be many things to different people.  One legal scholar described chess as an exercise in petty larcency (taking or stealing pieces!); many military strategists have seen chess as a system whereby one sharpens skills for thinking ahead, well past the next move tactically.  This would be more in the spirit of what Gelb and Keene are doing here.<br /><br />As the authors state, 'We are not likely to wield a Samurai sword in a life-or-death situation.  Samurai swordsmanship will always remain beyond our personal experience.'  So, how does one get this kind of experience, if one wants it?  For Gelb and Keene, this can come from chess.  'Chess offers the experience of real victory, without killing, and the parallel experience of real defeat, without having to die.'  Thought and skill are key in both Samurai and chess practice.<br /><br />Gelb and Keene develop the idea of martial arts mindset and the seven Samurai principles to be applied to chess, but this is in many ways designed for the beginning chess player (the more experienced player will be able to gloss over the second section, 'White Belt Chess', which develops basic movements and elementary middle-game and end-game ideas).  The authors give a good brief synopsis of the history of the game of chess, from earliest history through to the tempestuous twentieth century, showing the transformation from a slow-moving game inspired by Indian and Islamic cultures to the rapid-fire pace of many master games today.<br /><br />It is perhaps in the application of the Samurai principles that this book reaches its height.  The Seven Samurai principles are really an extended analogy to the game, but one can see immediately, even as a chess novice, how the seven principles might be applied:<br /><br />1) Take the Initiative: Attack<br /><br />2) Follow Through: Go for the Knockout<br /><br />3) Impenetrable Defense: No Openings<br /><br />4) Timing: Control the Tempo<br /><br />5) Distance: Control the Position<br /><br />6) Master Surprise and Deception<br /><br />7) Yield to Win: The Art of Sacrifice<br /><br />There are many good insights, and this book is a fun one to read.  If one is expecting a systematic tome on how to play better chess, this is not the book.  However, if one loves the game of chess and is interested in a new perspective, this book is one that is fitting.s in the application of the Samurai principles that this book reaches its height.

Certainly that designation has been applied to the entire oeuvre of this, America's poet laureate of the South, but this novel at least lends some strength to that criticism.  This is Faulkner at his worst, employing his obfuscatory style to hide the fact that he has very little to say.  The plot revolves around a down-and-out newspaper reporter who shows up to cover a traveling air show in the sleepy fictional southern town of New Valois in the early 20th Century.  He finds himself drawn into the personal lives of a family of barnstormers (two husbands, one wife, and one son), and plenty of hard drinking, brawling and barnstorming ensues.  Faulkner was always fascinated by airplanes, and readers who are old enough to remember those halcyon days might find this a fascinating  reminiscence of a somewhat sordid era in aviation history.  But ultimately, this story is about the culture clash between the reporter, who cares about people too much, and the aviators, who care only about the amazing machines that they daily risk their lives in.  Sadly, this man vs. machine conflict is badly dated, even by 20th Century standards, and doesn't fully succeed on any level.<br /><br />Of course one has to admire the sheer technical mastery of Faulkner's writing, but much of the real emotional power of his work usually comes from his use of archetypes:  the Earth Mother, the Mighty Hunter, the Soulless Businessman, the Righteously Angry Negro, the Guileless Innocent, etc.., and these archetypes not only make the story more significant - mythic, even - but they often help guide us through the complexities of the plot.  In this novel the characters seem not only very specific, but very small; they are neither familiar nor important.  Careful readers may be able to follow the plot of this novel, but there seems little enough impetus to bother doing so.  We care less about this particular group of losers than any such in Faulkner.  So while this drunken tale of planes, money and desire may find favor with completists, the rest of us would do better to get our Faulkner fix by re-reading one of his magnificent Yoknapatawpha County classics.er.

This is an entirely different kind of book, with subtle and humorous insights into a complex and very realistic group of eccentric characters, Inez Ferry, owner of an apartment building with her antique store on the first floor, and her employees and tenants and a few others.  Mr. Khoury, the cranky jeweler, is a gem.  There is a sense of tension building but at a remove, as would happen in an area where young women were being found killed, but most people still felt safe, still went to work, still had their morning tea and their little schemes and machinations.  Then, small items the killer has taken from his victims begin appearing in the antique shop, and the danger seems perilously near.  Not, however, to those of incorrigibly criminal intent, who see opportunity in such situations.<br /><br />A well-imagined and well-written novel, with a few small, forgivable flaws.	2005-10-12

What it amounts to is a single, run-on \\"chapter\\" detailing murder after murder.  There is zero information regarding any aspect of Hardin's life other than killing people and the events immediately before and after each episode.  These are strung together with variations on the phrase \\"nothing of interest happened until...\\" Apparently nothing much interested Hardin's small mind except mayhem.   <br /> <br />Hardin claims to have been hunted by increasingly large and diverse groups of men over impossible distances and yet, miraculously, information of his whereabouts always precedes him in such a way that various \\"posses\\" manage to fall upon his precise position in the middle of the enormous Texas backfield.  <br />In event after event Hardin claims to be on the side of truth and justice as he guns down lawman after lawman.  His logic process in justifying his frequent murders is so obtuse as to be laughable and reads like an older person's version of \\"the dog ate my homework.\\"  <br /> <br />Considering that he is generally the victim of surprise attacks it is a stretch to believe that he nearly always comes away without a scratch, even against impossible odds, while repeatedly managing to shoot at least one or two of his opponents directly in the center of the forehead.  To believe Hardin, one would have to conclude that only the most inept persons were employed in law enforcement, that they were all horribly poor marksmen, and that Hardin was not only the victim of a completely improbable string of circumstances but also the only person in Texas who hit exactly what he aimed at, every time, even under the worst of shooting scenarios.  To believe Hardin, one would have to be gullible in the exterme.  To believe Hardin one would have to be an idiot. <br /> <br />Even a cursory reading will show the reader that Hardin was, above all, a braggart.  His other talents included being a liar, a thief, a murderer and a pin head.  It would appear that the only reason Hardin's story remains in print is that it is a rare example of an autobiography of a blue-collar murderer from this era.   <br /> <br />Don't waste your money. <br />	2005-10-12

For that I give him five stars. <br /> <br />But I have to take a star off for his decision to frame this look back around Game 7 of the 2001 WS.   Why?   This game first off is too painful for a Yankee fan like me to want to revisit.   Every time I read this book I find myself glossing over the too long recaps of this game so I can get to the stories about the glory years of winning that have more meaning to me as a Yankee fan.    In the end, we're given more info about this one game then we are about some more important games that took place during this period and I think that's really unfortunate.    Olney could have achieved the same results if he'd framed things around Game 5 of the World Series, and kept the title because Game 5, in the wake of the Yankees second unbelievable comeback in that WS, represented the last night the magic of the dynasty was still there and triumphed.    And that would have been a far more worthy story for this Yankee fan than having to revisit the details of a game I will never watch again.	2005-10-12

What has finally come forth as \\"Engineering the World\\" will surely grace the public spaces of all TI facilities, providing visitors waiting to see TI engineers or interview for jobs an excellent overview of the company's considerable innovations and achievements during its first 75 years (e.g., the transistor radio and the integrated circuit).  But the book is not a definitive examination of the interpersonal dynamics among the extremely bright, ambitious, and hardworking men involved.  A chronicle such as Gay Talese's saga of the evolution of the New York Times (\\"The Kingdom and the Power,\\" London, Calder & Boyars, 1971) was not the model for this endeavor.  And at this point, with TI's founders and many principal participants gone, such a work is probably not possible.  Since, as far as I know, none of those folks was inclined to publish a memoir elaborating on his part in the company's creation and evolution, I assume that journals or diaries may not be available.<br /><br />For more detailed TI nuts and bolts, you might enjoy the story of Cecil Green, a founder of TI and its parent company, Geophysical Service Inc (\\"Cecil and Ida Green: philanthropists extraordinary,\\" by Robert Shrock, MIT Press, c1989), or the humorous memoir of 37 years at TI by engineer/inventor Ed Millis (\\"TI, the Transistor, and Me, \\" Dallas, Ed Millis Books, 2000).

I was in 3rd grade, it was during library period, and I was wandering around looking for a book to check out.  She, sensing my interest in books, directed me to a shelf containing the library's collection of Happy Hollisters.  I wasn't too interested at first, but with her encouragement I agreed to try one.  Many years later, at 42 years of age, not only do I still enjoy reading them, but I have read them to both my girls (12 & 17), and I have been fortunate enough to collect 2 complete series over the years.  When my daughters leave home, they will both have a set to read to their children. <br /> <br />I also discovered, when dating my wife, that she too had read and enjoyed the series.

Yuki also comes down with a fever that concerns Tohru and while everyone is out of the room he promises to tell Tohru something he has kept secret in the future. Kisa and Hiro show up at the summer home. Kisa buddies up to Tohru, which only serves to annoy Hiro. Tohru acts a bit more reserved about her mother after some harsh words from Hiro on the subject.<br /><br />Shigure visit's a bookstore run by Mayuko Shiraki, the homeroom teacher of Tohru and Shigure's ex-girlfriend. Their pasts, and that of Kana and Hatori Sohma, are revealed. Hatori also shows up at the book store, much to Mayuko's surprise. Her feelings for him from the past return to rear their ugly head, but she must now deal with the fact that he may have a girlfriend, according to Shigure.<br /><br />Shigure pays a visit to the summer home, where they are gearing up to eat watermelons. in the evening Kyo confronts Tohru on why she has been acting distant and he tells her about the death of his mother. Hatori also shows up to tell Shigure that he has delivered Akito and Kureno Sohma to a nearby guest house.<br /><br />Yuki meets Akito unexpectedly , just before the news of his presence hits the Sohma home. They realize they all must pay a visit, all but Tohru and Kyo, that is. Tohru goes out in the evening to search for Yuki, who has not returned from his walk yet, and under a shooting star Yuki reveals some things that weigh heavily on his mind along with a moment they shared together in their younger pasts, and then shares an intimate moment with Tohru.<br /><br />So, the romance between Tohru and Yuki is heating up as I expected, but I can't help but feel sad for Kyo.

It is hard to match the original, as this pedestrian attempt amply illustrates. Homer tells the story with poetry, drama, passion, and tenderness. Mike Chapman's version, on the other hand, is Christianized drivel which is bland, misleading, and often inaccurate.<br /><br />Mr. Chapman writes satisfactorily and may even love his subject, but he does not respect it. He has removed the vibrancy of Homer's epic by shifting its emphasis. Gone is the mythology of Achilles' lineage: his mother was the nymph, Thetis, daughter of the sea god Nereus. Mr. Chapman, inexplicably, makes Poseidon her father and Thetis a deluded woman who just thinks she is divine.  Gone is the decisive part the gods play in the story, altering it irrevocably.  Their interaction with and influence on the mortals, as well as the demigod Achilles, are integral to Homer's epic poem.  The costly 10-year war between the Greeks and Trojans was both precipitated and prolonged by the bickering gods.<br /><br />If the author's goal was to 'modernize' Homer by inventing 'rational' alternatives to the mythological and supernatural aspects of Homer's epic, he has succeeded only in removing its mystery and power.  Chiron, the wise centaur (half-man half-horse) who tutored Achilles in fighting, music, and the healing arts is merely a remarkable horseman.  No mention is made of Hephaestus, the smith god who forged Achilles' wondrous armor -  a plot point on which rests the fates of Patroclus, Achilles, Hector, and the tide of the war itself. Gone is the quiet magic of King Priam's touching nocturnal pilgrimage, aided by the god Hermes, to plead for Hector's body from angry, inconsolable, noble Achilles.<br /><br />Gone as well is any suggestion that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers. Their sexual relationship is widely recognized, as homosexuality between aristocratic Greek men and boys was a codified part of the society in general and the military in particular.  Here they are good buddies. By choosing to ignore their love, Mr. Chapman has eliminated the reason for Achilles' terrible grief and rage. Patroclus' ghost bade his beloved companion, \\"Just as we grew up together in our youth, so let our bones rest side by side and our ashes be mingled in the same urn.\\"  They were buried side by side and, centuries later, their graves were honored by two other great lovers of the ancient world, Alexander the Great and Hephaistion.<br /><br />I suspect Mr. Chapman fig-leafed Achilles' potent story to make it more `palatable' to modern (i.e., Christian) tastes and sensibilities. What he has wrought is an unimaginative war story, without magic or myth, which deeply diminishes Homer and his brilliant subject.ly recognized, as homosexuality between aristocratic Greek men and boys was a codified part of the society in general and the military in particular.

I have been a fan of Mr. Stirling's writing since a friend gave me a copy of 'Island in the Sea of Time'.  He continues to make me a happy reader with his new series begun in 'Dies the Fire' and continued here in 'The Protector's War'.<br /><br />  In contrast to some of the other reviewers' I really really like his inclusion of the Wiccan society and ritual in the storyline.  I am not a Wiccan myself, as a matter of fact I'm agnostic if anything, but I found his presentation of paganism to be very open-minded and interesting.  The fact that one almost never hears of this religion outside of a book written by one of it's adherants makes it a nice change from the usual Judeo-Christian centered stories.  Contrast is a good thing in my opinion.<br /><br />  Otherwise he continues to please with his speculation of where things would go and what people would do.  I would perhaps disagree with some of his conclusions but that's kinda what speculation is all about.  It makes your imagination run around inside your head and that's why I love these kinds of books written by Steve Stirling, Harry Turtledove and Eric Flint.	2005-10-12

I recommend this to anyone who has the time to listen for nine CDs worth of content.  I actually have a hard time imagining reading this book as it really is designed as a story and is directed towards a listener, not a reader.  The voice talent did a fabulous job, with the main reader (there are two) portraying accents including Indian, French and Japanese.  The main character is introduced in a very lengthy manner, which some have considered a waste of time, but I found very revealing to the character and his flaws, reasonings, and manner of thought. Yan Martel vividy describes several different worlds to readers including information for all five senses allowing the readers to truly experience the story, not merely read it.  I often found the detail so specific I found it hard to believe this wasn't a true to life account. <br /> <br />The story is just what the title suggests.  It is an early life (until he is 16) biography of Piscine Patel (he was named after the finest French swimming pool).  Martel plays the biographer in this first-person account of a boy who is raised in a zoo (beware the guinea pigs), discovers that God is, no matter how you look at him, and gets stuck in a life boat with a Bengal tiger for an impressive 227 days, including a short stay on a carniverous island (think giant venus fly trap). <br /> <br />The end leaves readers wondering what to believe, but the truth of the matter is academic, as it's not true anyway, so the reader is free to believe whatever he wants.	2005-10-12

The five steps in order are:<br /><br />1. Build Trust. Team members should be comfortable enough with each other to expose their vulnerabilities and weaknesses. Optimal solutions often emerge from a deeper undertanding of the overlap among the areas of weaknesses of different team members.<br /><br />2. Uncover, discuss, and resolve conflicts. This leads to healthier and more meaningful relationships over the long run.<br /><br />3. Inspire commitment to an overarching goal after the pros and cons have been frankly discussed. Often times, egos of the team members result in their pulling in different directions.<br /><br />4. Set up the right metrics and processes to ensure accountability.<br /><br />5. Pay close attention to results via regular follow up and coaching.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this four stars is that I haven't applied all this yet to a real world situtation to significantly improve team productivity and so don't know for sure that this works.

They are cast together in a quest to overthrow the Darke ExtraOrdinary Wizard, DomDaniel, who has taken over the Wizard's Tower and threatens to ruin the lives of the townspeople.  <br /> <br />Jenna was found in the snow by Silas Heap on the same night that his newly-born Seventh Son was pronounced dead and whisked away. He and his wife, Sarah, accepted Jenna as one of their own and raised her for ten years.  <br /> <br />It is discovered on her tenth birthday that Jenna is someone special, who must be protected at all costs. Marcia takes a special interest in the Heap family and ushers them to safety with the White Witch, Zelda. Mysterious charms and potions may protect them for a while. They may also learn the answers to many secrets and legends.  <br /> <br />But was the infant Septimus Heap really dead at birth? And if alive, who is this most Magykal wizard - the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son? And who will stop DomDaniel from destroying all of their lives with his encroaching Darkness?  <br /> <br />This book is great for those young and old. The spells and charms are quaint, such as Fly Free With Me and Fade into the Aire, with some suspense, but no outright scary or horrific elements to frighten young readers.  <br /> <br />The story is engrossing with a great sense of resolution at the end for each character, rather than a promised continuation, which is a nice feeling for young readers who don't want to be frustrated with wondering what happened to everyone involved. The book is great for adults as well.  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

I figured a three-hundred-year-old book needed an updating in the promotions department and except for sex, booze sells the best when it comes to advertising. Seriously, though, Robinson Crusoe is a rich character study that sheds light on the outlook of the human mind of the period, on the world, on civilization's merits, on basic behavior when confronted with extraordinary circumstances for which nothing in life has prepared you. Its tale of one Englishman shipwrecked on an uncharted island greets something wistful inside us all, some part of us that longs to \\"get away from it all\\" and escape. Yet at the same time, this novel also provokes a fear reaction from within, as Crusoe lives out his and our own terror of abandonment, of total loss, of being forgotten. This is a classic novel that addresses ageless themes and wraps them in a story that's actually quite good for  its age and all location-imposed limitations.	2005-10-12

He has a knack for finding interesting people and places, and he presents it all with wit and charm and a personal engagement that is beguiling. The books are beautiful with lots of great color pictures, most taken by photographer Basil Pao.    This book is based on the BBC TV program where Mr. Palin traveled to all of the places where Ernest Hemingway had lived and traveled. One can't really say the program \\"follows Hemingway's footsteps\\" because some sequences are presented out of order, but it's all there:    Chicago and northern Illinois (Hemingway's youth)  Italy (WW I and duck hunting)  Paris (Hemingway's start as an author)  Spain (running with the bulls, bullfighting)  Key West (fishing, boxing)  Africa (hunting, airplane crash injuries)  Cuba (fishing, Hemingway's home for 20 years)  Montana and Idaho (dude ranches, Hemingway's death)    Each chapter that describes a place almost invariably leaves the reader smiling and thinking that it would be interesting to visit that place oneself.    Incidentally, my high opinion of this book (and the associated TV program) has nothing to do with any interest in Hemingway's authorship. I read \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" when I was in high school, and have not read anything by Hemingway since. Still, I find his life interesting, and I think that Michael Palin has made a great travelogue by visiting the various places and telling about Hemingway's life.    I can especially recommend the audio version of this book, which is read by Michael Palin himself. He does a great job of delivering the dialog of the various people, all with their different accents.     Of course, the audio version of the book does not include the beautiful photographs, so the very best strategy might be to get both, and listen to the audio version while commuting and then look at the pictures when you get home.

I admit to researching like mad while still going to the gym to find programs, or elements of programs to which my body might be responsive.  I also admit to not entertaining the cleanest diet as of the last few weeks (but my frustration has been longer lasting than that!).  I'm a perfect target for bad marketing!<br /><br />Or a target for a good program.<br /><br />Anyway, I was searching for information about a different book at this site when (how embarrassing!) I was lulled by one of the site's many little ads for this book (repeat to self:  \\"I am NOT susceptible to marketing . . . I am not susceptible to marketing . . .).  I read the reviews, but then went to the bookstore, looking for another book.  I tripped across Mr. de Mey's book and sat down and started reading.  It was inspiring.  If I wasn't on my lunch break, I would've read the whole book there and then, sitting on the floor at the bookstore.<br /><br />Mr. de Mey has a very friendly -- and sincere --way of writing.  It's the sincerity that gets me the most.  While he certainly has every right to be an egotistical jerk(he has trained famous actors, male and female), he seems to be grateful for the way his life has turned out (of course, who knows what he's like behind closed doors, but I'm not inclined to think he is otherwise).  There is some spin in his book (which fitness book doesn't suffer from that?), but it's a lot less than I'm used to, and the vast majority of it is on the flaps (written by his publisher, undoubtedly).<br /><br />I've decided to become his guinea pig.  I am following his recommendations and program (starting at level 2) until at least Christmas Eve (December 24, 2005).  Hopefully my Christmas present to myself will be an improved guinea pig . . . er, physique.  I'll report later. :)<br /><br />Why?  Because his programs are different but seem free of the usual hype; they also seem reasonable; his success stories deal with the genetically gifted to the genetically cursed, and, my God, he looks great too.

And when a 'bad thing' rocks your life, a deep and abiding faith can bring you through to the other side, if you believe God's directive: Do not be afraid. <br /> <br />Claire Holland is a woman of deep faith. She has a wonderful life with God at its center. Claire loves her husband, Dan and children, Kate and Spencer. The Hollands dreamed of a large family, but several miscarriages left them emotionally wounded. To prevent further emotional pain, they decided on a vasectomy. <br /> <br />One night, leaving a mall, Claire is the victim of a heinous crime. Claire's faith, marriage and family are changed forever.  <br /> <br />Why the Sky is Blue by Susan Meissner is told from the perspective of Claire and her daughter Kate. It is a story of personal sacrifice, healing hearts and redemption.  <br /> <br />Meissner is fast becoming one of my favorite Christian fiction writers. She is a master storyteller who can deftly weave a thought-provoking plot with realistic, fully developed characters. She explores difficult subjects in a compassionate manner and that adds immeasurably to her work. Her fiction compels me to think, really think, about my faith and what would I do if a 'bad thing' happened to me. Would I follow God's direction, which might include personal sacrifice? Or would I forsake my beliefs for the 'easy way.' <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Read Meissner's book and examine the strength of your faith and convictions.

While waiting for the final Harry Potter book to come out, which could be years, I went on a quest to find a new series to start. Being picky because I still have Harry Potter on my mind, it was very tough to find a book that I'd be interested in. <br /> <br />When I saw the Greenstone Grail at my local library, I decided, \\"What the heck?\\" and gave it a chance.  <br /> <br />It has been wonderful! It drew me in from the very beginning and made me want to read more and more. At the start, it reminded me a lot of Harry Potter - the pre-teen boy who thinks he's otherwise normal but then finds out he has super special powers and is \\"the chosen one\\" to help save a dying world. Then as I read along more - it started reminding me of The Neverending Story.  <br />However, this book is a good cross between Harry Potter and The Neverending Story. The author makes it her own story and you aren't often reminded of other storylines while reading it. Her style of writing is different, and she gives you bits and parts of the storyline all throughout the book so that you're not kept waiting for something exciting to happen.  <br /> <br />I'm glad I started this series, and am now waiting yet again for another book to come out.

Edison is a private contractor which works with schools in order to bring a district's student performance to current standards. Through out the book, his company is mentioned numerous times which ultimatly leads to a distraction of what he is trying to convey.  <br />The start of the book is excellent, explaining the current education crisis we face. The figures, and comparissons made me truly think this book was going somewhere, until I read up to the middle where the book became slugish. His ideas of Reasearch and Development in education were very strong and well supported. This is the one idea that I clinched on to, the other ideas were loss in the talk about how Edison school was implementing them. Overall, the book started out with a great start, (and I give stars for the first few chapters) and went down hill from there.	2005-10-12

I could barely stay awake through it.  The story is good and I like the illustrations but, unlike with some dramatic tales of adventure, my interest slowly waned with each twist and turn of the plot.  I understand Mercer Mayer took a hiatus from writing children's books -- I'm glad he's back and look forward to his next one.  But I wouldn't buy this book.	2005-10-12

However old taxes never go away, so I see the compromize of the 16th Amendment surviving and income taxes being reinstated in some form. <br /> <br />I am for fair taxation, but not for this so-called \\"Fair\\" Tax plan. I don't see this as a solution. The solution is to stop reduce spending and collect the tax empowered by the government for just reasons.	2005-10-12

I was struck in the section about passion.  Recently, one of my employees kept giving me lip service but her actions did not match her words.  I realized that she didn't have passion for her job.  When people love what they do, they find ways to be successful. Sometimes people make mistakes, and if Martha has made some, it simply shows us that successful people are human.  I recommend this book to mentor anyone who wants to achieve outstanding success.  I also recommend Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self to discover how to master any feeling and make the most of any circumstance.  Read them both and you will be where you most want to be.	2005-10-12

My one complaint is it doesn't talk enough about what's going on in the actual races, and I still feel a little lost about what exactly is happening on the track, how exactly the race works, and what specific strategies the drivers are using.  A little more on the actual racing and this book would've been perfect.  But it's still an excellent intro if you're looking to learn about the sport.	2005-10-12

This book is indeed used in college courses.  The courses are taught by professors who defend that minority of young people who blamed U.S. involvement in Vietnam on their local police department. <br /> <br />It's hard for some baby boomers to believe, but many colleges employ professors who beg to differ with the Oliver Stone take on the counterculture.  I know one professor at a small Midwestern school who often cites the May 1968 issue of Vogue magazine.  It contains astute comments on the Vietnam issue by Marietta Tree, who had lost her boyfriend Adlai Stevenson three years earlier.  Others in her family comment, too.  Even the anorexic fashion model Penelope Tree is more eloquent than Mario Savio or Abbie Hoffman.  The Trees specify that the Rolling Thunder bombing campaign always fails, but maybe a few civilian advisers will work?  It's at any library with old Vogues. <br /> <br />Author Todd Gitlin ignores the Vogue article in this book, complaining instead that the mainstream media (desperate to foster \\"social organization\\" ?!?) censored most public outcries against the war.  Maybe he considers Vogue editor Diana Vreeland and the Tree family to be phony capitalist pigs?  Their testimony is there for all to see 37 years later, but you don't hear them in college classrooms.  You never hear about Eartha Kitt on campus, either.  Did her immortalization as Catwoman ruin her credibility in Berkeley? <br /> <br />Should I pay more attention to the unkempt people in the deliberately ugly clothes?  They aren't phony, and they always know what they're talking about.  Right? <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

It is not of the NewPulp variety in which I write-meaning there are no sex scenes. This book taught me things I didn't know. That's what I liked about it. I learned about the oil business, offshore drilling and how Texas corporate tycoons battle in the courts and elsewhere for the same prize-one to get it and one to keep it. The author's life experience certainly qualifies him to be our teacher. <br /> <br />The characters are rich and colorful. The story is a good one, although it does get a little complicated and somewhat unbelievable. But it isn't a big distraction. At the end, there are short, choppy scenes with too many scene switches for a book. However, that doesn't detract from the excitement and suspense that the author creates. Moreover, this book would make a great movie-better than the book because there is a lot of action that only the camera can solidify. The book is an entertaining read. I recommend it. <br />	2005-10-12

I was hesitant to read a book based on A Course in Miracles (ACIM) because it is hard to improve upon perfection.  As it turns out, I couldn't put \\"Everyday Miracles\\" down.  Loretta has a wonderful way of simplifying and capturing important points of ACIM without watering them down.  Reading these themes, presented in a new way, is very valuable and I felt the truth of this book sinking in while reading it.  I was so absorbed I literally read through it in a weekend.<br /><br />Going to the source (ACIM) also is recommended but ACIM can take months to read and takes a serious commitment.  \\"Everyday Miracles\\" is certainly a good option to familiarize yourself quickly with the concepts of metaphysical living through forgiveness, love and expecting miracles.<br /><br />For some reason several typos got through the early editions but I am sure later editions have corrected the issue BUT even if there are some typos, do not let these silly surface errors stand in the way.  All the best...	2005-10-12

Venom is introduced in a less confusing simplified Origin. I like the the idea that Pete and Eddie were friends at one point. Although somewhere in the first or second year of Ultimate Spidey...a Reporter named Eddie Brock is mentioned...Could be a distant realitive but, not likely. Also his death at the end? Why does He have to DI (Yeah I know according to the Ultimate Spider-man game, he didnt but as far as I'm concerned that doesnt apply...). And Venom seems to be reduced to some slobbering idiot (much Like the Goblin...notice a Trend here?) Good Story. Could be Better though.	2005-10-12
US	50801347	RCSJQABFXQORI	0375826688	342317933	Eragon (Inheritance)	Books	5	0	4	N	N	Like Harry Potter, only good.	When I started reading, it was amazing to me that a 15-17 year old author wrote it. It started a little slow, though I felt that it was written well. But when it started to pick up, about the time when he rescues you-know-who, the second half of the book just FLEW by, I could not put it down, and I forgot that I was reading a book by a teenage and could only remember what a great fantasy novel it was. I finished it with the opposite reaction after reading Harry Potter #1. At the end of that, I felt it was a quality book, but by no means did it live up to the hype as the best children's book ever written. Whereas, this book sneaks up on you and you walk away feeling satisfied and excited for the rest of the story.<br /><br />Sorry to all of the hard core SciFi/Fantasy fans. I had a difficult time getting through all of Tolkein and I've read Lloyd Alexander a hundred years ago and I think I've read McCafferty but I can't recall. I do consider myself a fan of the genre, however, I enjoyed Narnia, Piers Anthony and Orson Scott Card, etc. I'll be glad to add this author to my collection of favorites.	2005-10-12
