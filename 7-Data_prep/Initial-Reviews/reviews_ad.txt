In the tradition of Dickens and Vonnegut, King relies heavily on caricature and hyperbole to tell a tale of the struggle between the forces of greed, hubris and ambition on the one hand, and selflessness, virtue and humility on the other.  <br /> <br />Multiple storylines revolve around the central plot in which John Brown, a corporate executive, must stop a flesh-eating computer virus that threatens to destroy civilization. The virus is unleashed when the powerful computer chip it has infected, the Octopus, is installed in the desk of the company's founder and patriarch, Montague Millstone. Brown is confronted with the toughest decision of his life as he determines that there is only one way to neutralize it. <br /> <br />Montague Millstone is an ego-driven businessman obsessed with empire and acquisition. His narcissism leads him to believe he can achieve immortality as he transfers all of his bodily functions into his desk. For this reason, he is determined to eliminate the \\"death tax\\", a levy applied exclusively to multi-million dollar estates, so as not to lose any control over any piece of his property when his frail, human body finally expires. Assisting him in this endeavor are a variety of corporate lobbyists, his own privately-funded \\"think tanks\\", and any number of congressmen beholden to him for his generous campaign contributions. <br /> <br />Complementing the main plot are a variety of subplots involving Christian and Islamic clergymen, a self-styled revolutionary, a sinister consultant, a selfless, flea market vendor, and a cast of powerfully-drawn, minor characters. These subplots are brilliantly interwoven with the main plot to create a tapestry of life in modern America. <br /> <br />A complex, multi-layered book, repletewith metaphors and references to purely American events and personalities, The Soul of America challenges the reader to question conventional wisdom and the images created by the mainstream media. And although the humor is dark, the book is hopeful, as a spiritual undertone threads its way though to the end, where we discover the soul of America. <br />	2005-10-12

The author is a professor in comparative literature at Bar-Ilan U in Tel Aviv and director of the Aleph Center for Jewish Studies in Paris, an author of academic, fictional, and children's literature. The book is not as rigorous as I had hoped, but the superior artistic style of the illustrations and the very accessible writing (consider it's a translation, and from French!) more than make up the disappointment I initially had.  <br /> <br />The book focused on the proto-Saini script, a critical transition from the Egypitian cuniforms to phonographic writing. Being a Jewish scholar, the author took full advantage of the Semitic languages these earlest forms of alphabetic writing intented to transcribe. Connections between various forms of alphebet and their kinships were clearly laid out, supported with illustrations and pictures of artifacts. The author was successful in striking a balance between readability and making references to original research work. References were given at the end of each chapter with incredibly small print, although researchers' names were prominately cited in the main text, which is in a comfortably large font.  <br /> <br />The first part of the book is a historic review of the orgin of the alphebetic writing, with interesting personal remarks on various topics. The section on Chinese (p. 31-36, with several pages of illustrations in between) was simplistic and outdated, reflecting popular writings on Chinese from 20+ years ago. I hope this is not an indication of the quality of other parts of the book, though, because the author appears to be an expert on Hebrew and other languages/cultures of the region in which alphabetic writing rose.  <br /> <br />About 2/3 of the pages were devoted to an A-Z dictionary of letters. The author kept to his focus on the early transition from cuniforms to proto-Saini to other scripts. Again, various froms of the letters are illustrated with pictures, tables, and occasionally caligraphies. An interesting touch is the summary table at the end of each letter chapter, summarizing the historic changes, and the Hebrew roots of words starting with the letter. It's informative, but I don't know how useful they are to other languages.  <br /> <br />Part III of the book, titled \\"The Archeographic Revolution\\", should probably be renamed to \\"fun ways to teach you and your kids proto-Saini writing\\". The author gave some interesting ideas and examples of how to write one's name with the pictoric-phonographic alphabet. It's neither a revolution of the study of old scripts nor a ground-breaking way to teach reading (by using dead pictograms?). It's nonetheless a cute idea and reflects the author's interests in children's literature.  <br /> <br />Overall the book is an engaging introduction to the evolution of alphabetic writing, particularly the early transition from ideographic writing. The rich illustrations in the book are of high artistic styles. Oh, did I mention it's printed on heavier paper? It sure feels good in hand. I'd recommend the book as for enjoyment and casual reference (illustrations and tables). Readers looking for scholarly rigior probably wants to read sources he referred to in the book.

Why?  1) Musical examples are chosen seemingly because Yudkin got tired of the tried-and-true favorites (Bach Brandenburg Concerti are not on the student CD set, but the St. Matthew Passion is.  As a result, the students may get to hear Bach Brandenburg Concerti in class but can't listen on their own).  Same is true for Verdi:  Otello is included, but not Rigoletto or La Traviata?   2) This text is written for the average music major (not stellar, just average), rather than a music appreciation student.  He assumes much greater knowledge of instruments, timbre, texture, and familiarity with general musical terms than any introductory student will have.  3) An exasperating dilemma:  many works on the instructor CD set are not on the student set, despite those being the better selections.  Why not put the obscure works on the instructor CDs, and let students have access to really great works?  For example, when he selected a recording of a madrigal, he picked one that has two females singing a verse, then two males singing a verse...nothing at all like 95% of all madrigals students would ever be likely to hear.  The reason?  He knows the performers on the CD!  Students never get to hear real text painting as every \\"real\\" madrigal illustrates.  It's hard to build on that when asking students to understand the concept of text painting. <br /> <br />Anyway, I'm not Yudkin-bashing, but there are definitely problems with this text that need to be addressed.	2005-10-12

I've read all of Robin Maxwell's books (except for [[ASIN:0060091436 The Wild Irish: A Novel of Elizabeth I and the Pirate O'Malley]]) and I'm happy to say that her writing style, which can sometimes be a bit sticky, has improved much in this book. The story is much more readable then in her past books, and the plot is fantastic. Her characters (all real historical figures) have clear motivations for what they do in this book.      But anyway, to the plot. This is a novel about the tower princes, Edward IV's two sons who disappeared after their uncle Richard III steals the crown. Although popular history has Richard murdering his two nephews, Maxwell has a different and very credible theory. The story is told as a narrative to young Henry VIII, by his mother Queen Elizabeth and his godmother Nell Caxton, daughter of the first man to print books in English.    The amount of freedom that Nell and Bessie have may seem odd to some, but its in accord with their status (which was privelaged) and education backround. England at the time before Edward IV's death was fairly peaceful, and this book is really about the change from that peace into the harsh danger of war time and roayl takeovers.     Readable and entertaining, this book is perfect for the Tudor maniac or just plain historical fiction fans out there.	2005-10-12

I am a huge fan of the Nightmare on Elm Street series. I've memorized the entire script for the original film. Now onto the book.<br /><br /> Filled with tons a sexuality and language, this book is extremely dirty, even by my standards. Every other word out of Krueger's despicable mouth is either `bitch' or `Daddy'. It's extremely uncreative. Ten pages in, David Bishop takes a line right out of Freddy vs. Jason. The book is repetitive and sometimes extremely boring. The characters are hardly developed, and when it seems we will begin to learn more about them, it continues it's repetitive pattern. It's racist and suggestive. There's too much, `come to Daddy' this and `for f***'s sake' that. If you are a fan of Elm Street 1, then this book is not for you. If you are in love with Elm Street 4 through 6, then here you go. Still, I wouldn't waste 8 bucks on it. Buy it only if you're a fan.<br /><br />2 dirty mouths out of 5<br /><br />R for horror violence/gore, strong language, and sexuality/nudity (just for the kiddies)!	2005-10-12

I read forty pages the first night I had it, and finished the book (all seven hundred some pages of it) the next day. I literally couldn't put it down.      The story of Fiona and her love Joe two poor kids from Whitechapel who've been in love their whole lives only to lose each other when Joe begins to make a success of himself and Fiona's parents die tragicaly, is compelling, but what's so great about this novel is the amount of historical detail that makes it some realistic. It's obvious that a great deal of research went into this book, and the work paid of for Ms. Donnelly, because this book is so vivid its like your there in Whitechapel with Fiona and Joe, and then in old glamorous New York where great steam ships roll in in and a fortune is there for anyone with the smarts to work for it.      Buy this book, make some tea, and sit down with two enterprising young lovers, one scheming evil villain and a story of the true resilience of the human spirit.

The CD did not come out of my CD player for over a month, and I felt driven to learn his style. This book was extremely useful in helping me learn this style.  I have had the book about 4 months and can play about half the songs.  The learning process involves following the tab and listening to the CDs over and over.  The first song I attempted to learn (Spikedriver's Blues)took some time and a lot of patience.  You have to learn to play the alternating base while putting in the melody lines.  Now that I have practiced his style for four months, many of the other songs are coming much easier.  The book includes the lyrics, so that after learning the song, one can practice singing over the guitar. I have been playing guitar 17 years, and haven't found a particular style that sucked me in so much.  The CDs that accompany the book are excellent as well, and include some songs which I haven't found on many of his popular recordings.  The songs are excellent.  I actually practice more guitar each day, because of this style and this book.  I bought an instructional DVD for Mississippi John Hurt as well, but use this book far more often.	2005-10-12

While waiting to adopt our daugther from China, my husband and I read this book. It was by far one of the best books we've ever read and we would recommend it to anyone. It is a factual story of true faith...as the Bible says, \\"the faith of a child\\". As my husband was reading it and chuckling or shaking his head in disbelief at what he was reading, I couldn't stand the suspense and he'd read me an exerpt from it, after the first few nights, I'd come to bed only to ask him, \\"so what's Jacelyn doing today\\". Even after knowing the ending...which is great, I had to read it myself, and didn't want to put it down.  He's now reading it a second time.	2005-10-12

He begins with an in-depth chapter on the influence of the railroads on settlement, and then a short chapter each on homesteading, ethnic communities, pioneer politics, and a couple of poems about places lost to time. Then comes the main part of the book: an alphabetical listing of the towns, from Aldridge to Whitlash. Descriptions of each town and usually a photograph are included (there is usually something still standing in these town worth seeing). The only thing missing are maps - there are none (most placenames are still listed on recent detailed highway maps, however, but not all; DeLorme's Montana topo map book is useful). I had a chance to use this book this summer on a trip to Montana and found it to my liking. Well done!	2005-10-12

It's a good book for those in the professional/doctoral ranks to evaluate and a risk for most to get useful results.   <br /> <br />The usefulness of the book is totally based on your taking a one-time-only on-line evaluation based on a code on the inside coverslip of the book.  If that evaluation fails in some regard, you'll be lost with no confidence in the results.  The book comes across as chintzy, with no foresight in these cases.  <br /> <br />The first recommendation, then, if you do use the book, is to take the evaluation, immediately, based on the instructions in CH 4.  If you feel that it didn't go well for whatever reason, return the book (or throw in the trash) if you had planned to get personal help with it -- it won't be possible any longer. <br /> <br />Again, the book does present ideas which professionals in human resources, psychology, or school systems may find useful.  Some of these professional readers may find the ideas useful to sift into their own ideas on how to discover your strengths.	2005-10-12

I cannot say the same about this sequel. I am very dismayed that a book that almost entirely explores themes of masturbation and pre-marital teen sex would be marketed for the 9-12 age group. Parents should be aware of this and should be prepared to discuss these issues with their children if they bought this book.  I have no problem with the themes for older teens, only in how they are handled. In this story, the main character's (SPOILER ALERT) impulsive choice to have sex at the end of the book is motivated by her perception that her boyfriend was not interested in having sex with her. This was despite the fact that she had \\"decided\\" just before to tell him she was not ready. So the implied message for young girls seems to be that girls should do anything necessary to keep a boy, even against their better judgment. Flashback to the Fifties!  Unfortunately, in real life this is a choice that too many young girls make every day and makes Sam not only unenlightened but selfish.  The male character, David doesn't fare any better. David is characterized as clueless, allowing his girlfriend to make all of the relationship choices including bringing the contraceptives.  David goes along, in spite of the fact that his parents are in the house. (Something that also happens all the time in real life, but the \\"character\\" of the characters is not much in evidence here even though both Sam and David are in circumstances that require them to be role models.)  The choices made by the characters are presented with a curious no big deal, everyone's doing it, matter of fact attitude. There is only a slight mention of the fear of sexually transmitted disease and pregnancy, but these concepts are quickly dismissed with the notion that using certain types of contraceptives will make for safe sex. I wonder where Meg Cabot got her information? The problem is that too many young people still believe this is the case. This book's point of view ignores one ofthe real issues: emotionally immature youth engaging in an overwhelmingly emotional behavior that they are ill prepared to handle. Many studies gauging the physical and emotional health of teens who have sex show plainly how destructive this behavior can be. This book is irresponsible and dangerous in that it implies that teens can have sex with no major impact, physical, emotional or moral for themselves or their families. Be forewarned - this book is not for ages 9-12. It might be appropriate for older teens, but hopefully only with parental discussion. Shame on Meg Cabot, she must be a Clinton fan too.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

It brought me feelings I rarely have when I read books. I love that there was no mad jealous villain after the heroine. Although the hero was engaged, the readers can sense she is really not a threat to the heroine. The real threat here was the social status that separates the main characters and family obligation. I felt the love Lizzie has for Tyrell. Ms. Brenda Joyce made sure the reader can not detached themselves from this story. I was moved when Tyrell was begging Lizzie not to leave him. I cried when Lizzie is force to make a decision to spare her family more shame. Not once did I doubt that Tyrell loves Lizzie. This book was written beautifully. I couldn't put it down, I read it until 2 am and woke up at 4:30a to read again. Now I have to go to work and I have a splitting headache. The funny thing is I'm just dying to read it again tonight after I come home from work. Thanks Ms. Joyce. I feel like 15 again when I first read my romance novel. Captivated.	2005-10-12

President Abraham Lincoln, his wife Mary and family would journey to the Soldiers Retirement Home about 4 miles from the White House. Son Robert would visit on his trips home from Harvard. Youngest Lincoln son Tad enjoyed the Soldiers' Home where he had a menagerie of pets; got to know the guard troops from Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio stationed there. Wife Mary was often vacationing in New England or shopping in New York.<br /><br />  In this atmosphere Lincoln enjoyed the camaraderie of soldiers; received visitors and enjoyed the company of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton living in a nearby cottage.<br /><br />  It was in this location that the President agonized over his decision to issue the Emancipation Proclamation; decided to fire<br /><br />George B. McClellan and help plan the 1864 presidential campaign.<br /><br />  Every day Lincoln would ride a horse to the White House surrounded by mounted cavalryman. His wife Mary fell from her carriage in July, 1863 while traveling to the home. She was seriously injured .<br /><br />  Pinsker tells us of plots against Lincoln's life. He may have even been fired upon by an unknown assassin according to a soldier who reported this incident in his postwar memoirs.<br /><br />  Matthew Pinsker has written an outstanding book adding to our knowledge of the heretofore little known Lincoln residence at the Soldiers Home. The Home is now a National Landmark and is being renovated and opened for the public. One can imagine how awed poet Walt Whitman was as he saw Lincoln on his daily ride from the White House to the Soldiers Home.<br /><br />  Pinsker draws on a vast array of first person accounts, letters,memoirs and can be complimented on adding to our knowledge of the Lincoln presidency.<br /><br />  The book is well illustated with maps and is an outstanding addition to anyone interested in the Civil War and the Lincoln presidency. Well recommended!coln presidency. Well recommended!	2005-10-12

However, I recently traveled to the Valais region (SW of Switzerland) and found really very little in the way of useful information from this book. <br /> <br />As an example, on of the smaller, rural valleys in the region called Val d'Herens had a single paragraph including a sentence that said the valley was not to be missed, but nothing on why or what to see.  The valley was filled with charming towns like Evolene and beautiful villages (personally, I recommend the village of Arolla at the head of the valley for beautiful hiking). <br /> <br />I did not visit any major areas besides Zermatt that were well covered by the book, but perhaps if your trip revolves around cities of good size, this is the right book for you.  For those seeking an overall country guide, this book does not provide a good enough level of detail.	2005-10-12

Beethoven Lives Upstairs is easy to read and hard to forget, and is a positive tale almost anyone should find likable.	2005-10-12

Well, I really didn't want to write a negative review of an S. M. Stirling novel; Mr. Stirling lives just up the road from me, is a fellow Newfie and shares many interests such as martial arts and history.  I have enjoyed his books for many years.<br /><br />That said, `The Protector's War' was really a disappointment. A disappointment because Mr. Stirling doesn't appear to have read any of the Amazon reviews of the first book in this series, \\"Dies the Fire.\\"  Large numbers of reviewers, myself included, commented on our dislike of all the Wiccan claptrap, of the negative portrayal of Christianity, and especially of the all-too-convenient emergence of handy characters and skill sets just when needed.<br /><br />In volume two of this trilogy-to-be, these flaws are compounded by semi-flashbacks and a glacial pace of action.  Really, we don't need to know about every trailside weed, especially if that knowledge comes at the cost of a molasses-like plot.  Honestly, pretty much nothing happens in the first half of the book that couldn't be dealt with in a recap-forward and a couple tightly written paragraphs.<br /><br />Yes, \\"The Protector's War' has strengths.  It does a good recap, it is meticulous, and it is honest.  All the favored characters from the first volume are back, and we are nicely brought up to date with the nine-years later plot.  Also, although the editors didn't do great on this book, they restrained the author's tendency to write a lot of unconventional sex into his books.<br /><br />I do hate to bust chops, but I really suggest Mr. Stirling go to some ghost towns (there are plenty near his home), abandoned industrial sites, old farms, and on some nature walks.  Sorry, but nature does not reclaim buildings, roads, and infrastructure at a fraction of the speed he postulates.  Who among us hasn't found a forty year old building still standing or a decades abandoned road quite passable.  And that's in temperate climates!	2005-10-12

He was the first president of the Screen Writers Guild and had a string of plays on Broadway in the 1920's.  He joined the American Communist Party, was later blacklisted and moved to Mexico.<br /><br />His play \\"Processional\\" was written in 1925 and produced by the Theatre Guild.  It combines music and a sense of vaudeville into the political intrigue of a coal miner's strike in West Virginia.<br /><br />The play centers around two main characters.  Sadie Cohen is the daughter of a Jewish shopkeeper Isaac.  Isaac is a single parent who tries to keep a tight reign on his young daughter whose hormones & adolescence are making her rebel against her father.  Dynamite Jim Flimmins is the other character who has been jailed and busts out of jail.  There is a group of miners who are talking about striking because of mistreatment by management represented by a character called \\"The Man in the Silk Hat.\\"  They play various instruments and march while playing jazz improvisations on an ever-changing variety of instruments.  One of the leaders is a Polish guy named Jake Psinski who happens to be nearby when Jim Flimmins breaks out of jail.  Along with a superstitious black man named Rastus, they carry Jim's hidden body in a coffin up a hill to a large building called the Labor Temple with two statues, one representing \\"Capital\\" and the other \\"Labor\\" under a sign \\"American Manhood.\\"<br /><br />A young soldier sent to capture the convict named Bill discovers Jim.  In the struggle, Jim skewers Bill with a bayonet blade; and now will be executed for sure.  Sadie is standing nearby.  Thinking he has nothing to lose, Jim drags Sadie into a mine, rapes and impregnates her.  Jim and Jake escape to an old barn where Jim's mother Euphemia Flimmins lives.  She hides them in a cellar just as the sheriff arrives.  Jake is captured and taken to jail, but Jim escapes and goes on a rampage killing soldiers who have been sent in to quash the miner's strike.<br /><br />Act Four moves forward six months.  The soldiers have gone and been replaced by the Ku Klux Klan who arrive to restore morality.  Pregnant Sadie is about to be tarred and feathered for loose morality and for being Jewish when we find that both her father Cohen and black Rastus are hiding underneath Klansmen sheets, the father to save his daughter and Rastus because he figured the safest place to hide was underneath a sheet.  Jim enters.  We learn that he was strung up by Klansmen and blinded, but later released by the judge in Charleston for lack of evidence, the judge figuring what's a blind man going to do to bother people anyway.  Jim learns that Sadie is pregnant.  The most un-romantic of wedding proposals is conducted for convenience.  Now that Jim will marry Sadie, the Klan figures she's morally okay as a married woman and stop threatening the girl.  The head of the Klan is also the head of business represented by the Man in the Silk Hat.  The play ends with the jazz wedding and the miners settling the strike because management doesn't want any more bad publicity.  It's bad for business.<br /><br />\\"Processional\\" is a highly charged political piece.  Some of it is extremely dated today.  One character, Pop Pratt, is described as \\"your typical Civil War veteran,\\" a phrase that doesn't resonate 80 years after the show's first production.  Lawson substitutes political struggle and jazz for character development.  Thematically and stylistically, the play seems more related to Brecht's \\"Mother Courage & Her Children\\" where we observe the characters haggling over war, but don't identify with them.  In \\"Processional,\\" there really is no one to root for, a good guy vs. a bad guy.  When Jim, the protagonist, is a murderer and rapist, it's hard to really stand up and cheer.  Even his mother resorts to prostitution to try to raise money for her son's escape.  It is a passionate political landscape depicted.  Although the action isfast-paced and riveting, to me this play seems more comfortable confined on the page than the stage today.ugh the action is fast-paced and riveting, to me this play seems more comfortable confined on the page than the stage today. <br />	2005-10-12

I've read a few books about Hitler, mainly because I was directed to do so in various classes, and of them all, this was the best. In dubbing Hitler : A Study in Tyranny the best, I mean it presented copious information (nicely backed up with an immense quantity of footnotes) and never strayed into validating the myths about its subject. One can read this abridgment of Bullock's work (I have never seen the long version) and come away reasonably well-informed about Hitler, his rise to power, the Second World War, and the Nazi regime with its various social misfits, failures, and  assorted lovers-of-self. Bullock is an admirable sort of historian, one who does not inject his own personality far into his material and does not speculate so much as simply present facts through as little cultural filter as possible.<br /><br />In my views, as the title of this review declared, Adolph Hitler is given more credit than he deserves. Yes, he is at times too readily written off as \\"a nut\\" and left at that, but just as often (and increasingly in this century) he is unfairly praised and credited with accomplishments that were not fully his own. He is usually described as, \\"Boy, he was evil, but he was a genius.\\" Was he? Was he truly?<br /><br />Not only was the hard-working German nation by 1933 on the path to an economic recovery of amazing scope, but the unrest of the 1920's with its inter-party feuding and Communist threat, was largely dissipating. Hitler is falsely believed in the popular view to have single-handedly set his nation on a path out of depression and into prosperity, while simultaneously quelling unrest and restoring order. In fact he had little to do with either, he came along at a time most propitious for him to make claims of responsibility for these things, but he did not author his (adopted) country's recovery.<br /><br />As for Hitler being \\" a genius\\" let's consider for a moment the deeds of this \\"strategic mastermind.\\"  Rather than containing his aggressions, Hitler took on virtually ALL the powers of Europe and eventually--in a fit of bad judgment so profound it should dispel his mystique right there-embroiled his nation in war with the United States, against whom the American people were not at war and were unlikely to be after the Pearl Harbor attack. Hitler allowed the British army to escape at Dunkirk, he invaded his own ally, the Soviet Union, he so centralized power within the military that on D-Day his generals were paralyzed without authority to act without the go-ahead from Berlin, and he set into motion such cruelties against his own citizens and the populations of those lands he occupied that any widespread support he might have gained was almost entirely lost to his armies.<br /><br />The man was not a military mastermind, not a political genius, and beyond any doubt not the savior of Germany, which he all-but destroyed in his less than dozen years as absolute ruler.  Hitler was the architect and inspiration for mass murder and more human misery and suffering than any one person the world had witnessed up to that time. Alan Bullock is to be praised for remembering all of these things and tossing the Hitler myth out of the window. I wish more people would read books like these before they go on perpetuating misinformation about an evil man they do not know as much about as they likely think they do.opted) country's recovery.

His influence extended beyond naval architecture into American culture by making the America's cup an exciting and avidly followed event.

To make matters worse, several examples are missing characters or have additional characters that prevent the reader from understanding the scripts. <br /> <br />For example, I/O redirection gets only two pages in the entire book. I kept waiting for him to re-visit redirection in more depth, but he never did. Not only that, but one of the few I/O redirection samples has a typo that leaves the reader puzzled as to how redirection works at all. The typo is so bad that it renders the entire example incorrect. <br /> <br />I think this book was written by and for system administrators who need to do smaller tasks, rather than for developers who both want and need to understand the fundamentals of how Bash scripting works. After reading the entire book, all I gained was a basic Bash vocabulary. I was forced to find more comphrensive books and scripts on the topic in order to understand \\"how stuff works\\" and be proficient enough to write scripts on my own.	2005-10-12

This may not be a false track, although auteur theory has a bad rap right now. Kurosawa, in the conclusion of his autobiography said, \\"look for me in my films\\".<br /><br />Kurosawa was a genius, his films full of life and compassion, and strength. He did not look away from ugly truths in his life or art. (Read the autobiography and understand the significance of this approach!)<br /><br />I recommend this book as the touchstone for a deeper appreciation of the art of Kurosawa, for an understanding of his complex personality, and for the human warmth that comes across in his reminiscences. By the end of the book, you will want more, of course. It will seem to end abruptly and too soon. You will have many questions that you will wish to have answered. But then, we'll take Kuroswa's advice. We'll look for the man in his films.	2005-10-12

The author documents the achievements of George Scovell, one-time apprentice to an engraver, who rose through the ranks of Wellington's Army to be responsible -- no-less than more famous actors -- for the British victory over Napoleon.  While the history examines Scovell's masterful feat of ingenuity, it also narrates the events and context of military engagements throughout the campaign.<br /><br />This underappreciated gem gets an enthusiastic five stars.	2005-10-12

Although it won't always have the word you are looking for, it will have most of them.  And you won't waste anytime looking up the meaning of the words used to define the word you were looking up, like you will with other, bigger, snobbier dictionaries.  The definitions are simple, to the point and laconic (unlike me).  I have taken this book just about everywhere with me since I bought it, nearly ten years ago.  Sure the gold lettering is wearing off the cover and the edges of the pages are discolored from fingertips and pocket-grime, but it has held up to the abuse!  Love it!	2005-10-12

I consider this book a must read for anyone not just basketball fans.  It does a good job of portraying what it is like to go through an actually season in the NBA.  You find out sides of players that you would never imagine.  I would recommend this book for anyone over 13 who is a basketball fan because of foul language.   <br /> <br /> The book takes place for the most part in Los Angeles where Phil Jackson is coach of the Los Angeles Lakers Basketball Team.  Before the season starts a player by the name of Kobe Bryant is accused of rape.  This presents an obstacle for the team and transforms into bigger problems with the team.  Would they be able to overcome there problems??? <br /> <br /> My mother purchased this book for me at borders and I am unsure of the price.  I would give this book an A+!  This is quite possibly the best book I have ever read.  You see you here all this stuff through the media and what not and you are not quite sure what to believe.  This book is a tell all of the season that the Los Angeles Lakers had.  You see how Kobe Bryant was clearly out of control.  You see how Phil Jackson had a relationship with the owner Dr. Busses daughter.  You see Shaq trying to be a leader and trying to encourage the other players.  You here how Kobe Bryant was almost kicked off the team!  All this information first hand from Phil Jackson himself.  At the end of every season, every coach should right a book because it is just so interesting! <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I think Phil Jackson's the final season is a great read.  But it gets even more interesting.  Phil Jackson is coming back to coach the Lakers again this year!  What will the outcome be this time?  Only time will tell.... <br />  <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-10-12

From Boston to the Rockie Mountains, and parts in between, this is one rip roaring ride. The author allows us to see the trails west through the eyes of a naive greenhorn who is a cross between the Count of Monte Cristo and Steve Urkel. The good-natured young gentleman, intent on being helpful, seems to leave disaster wherever he passes through. He acquires loyal comrades and deadly enemies with equal ease and departs every locale with hilariously preposterous consequences. The author has peopled his story with a large cast of diverse personalities and backgrounds. The convergence of the various groups of characters reminds me of the movie \\"Hallelujah Trail\\" (1965) (book by Bob Gulick). For a good belly laugh, this story will deliver. Great fun!	2005-10-12

Tohru Honda is a young high school girl fresh from the grief of her mother's death. She tries to look on the bright side of everything, but it is rather difficult considering that due to circumstances beyond her control she is forced to live in a tent. One day on a walk to school she passes a house that has rocks decorated to look like the animals in the Chinese zodiac and she discovers that it is actually the house of Shigure Sohma, and more importantly, Yuki Sohma from her class. She makes the comment that Shigure left out the cat from the Chinese zodiac and Yuki later becomes annoyed at this, declaring he hates cats. Yuki and Tohru walk to school together and Tohru suddenly becomes a topic of conversation.<br /><br />Later when Tohru returns to her \\"Home\\" she is spotted by Shigure and Yuki, who invite her to live with them in exchange for housework. A sudden surprise from fellow Sohma family member, Kyo, causes some uproar. Kyo and Yuki have been bitter enemies since they were children and always end up fighting. In the midst of the scuffle Tohru ends up embraces Kyo and to her utter shock he turns into a cat. In the confusion she also hugs Yuki and Shigure who turn into a rat and a dog respectively... what can this mean?<br /><br />It seems that the Sohma family is cursed. For every year of the Chinese zodiac one of the family is born with an ability to change into that animal whenever they are embraced by a member of the opposite sex (other zodiac members not included) or when they are under great stress. Along with the traditional twelve animals there is also the cat, who is a rogue in the family and lives under an exclusive curse due to an old legend.<br /><br />The Sohmas want to keep Tohru around if she can keep a secret, but this must be approved by the mysterious Akito, the head of the Sohma clan. When he approves Yuki becomes suspicious, seeing as how anyone in the past who discovered the secret had to have their memories erased. What can Akito possibly be up to?  Is Tohru up to the challenge of keeping the secret, plus keeping the peace between all in the Sohma house?<br /><br />This series is so intriguing. I am completely entranced to read the next volume. There is enough mystery, what with the secret of Akito, the obvious clandestine nature of Kyo's background, and the love interest between Yuki and Tohru, and seemingly also Kyo and Tohru though I can't quite be sure yet... I hope there will be a love triangle, would make it much more interesting. Also introduced in this volume is Kagura Sohma, a cousin who is deeply in love with Kyo and bears the sign of the boar. I also appreciate the illustrations in this series. The artist is highly skilled, it's all very beautiful work. Definitely worth a read.kito possibly be up to?

Anyone who is interested in saving money, investing, or financial security who has not heard of Robert Kiyosaki or Rich Dad, Poor Dad has been on another planet. Since 1997 Kiyosaki has built a financial education empire around the concept expressed in his first book, Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Rich Dad's Classics is a boxed set of three of Kiyosaki's books in their most up-to-date printing.  <br /> <br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad: In this the original, the author details the things he learned from his \\"two fathers.\\" The first, his biological father, was a well-respected educator who spent most of his life needing to earn money to pay for things that demonstrated his status. Since he worked for money rather than putting money to work for him he is referred to as the \\"Poor Dad.\\" <br /> <br />The \\"Rich Dad\\" was his best friend's father. He spent less than he earned and put the difference to work in building a business, developing land and real estate, etc. Since he put money to work for him he was referred to as the \\"Rich Dad.\\" <br /> <br />The book reveals the simple truths: Those that build wealth and have money working for them, put to work every day. The average person is unaware of this simple truth. It is understanding what an asset is (something that generates money passively) rather than what it means from an accounting standpoint. If you have to pay into something every month, it is a liability because you owe. When it pays you it is an asset. For most people, then, their house, viewed on a balance sheet as an asset is really a liability. Though there may be equity there is a constant service on the debt. <br /> <br />The Cash Flow Quadrant: In the second book of the series, the author explores the four positions one can be in with respect to money: employee, boss, investor, self-employed. He argues that education is geared toward teaching people that the \\"e\\" or \\"s\\" quadrants are good places to be: get a secure job and save for retirement or get into a good profession andsave for retirement.  <br /> <br />Kiyosaki, on the other hand explains that real wealth and ultimate financial security is in either being a boss of your own business that leverages the efforts of others or being an investor who either invests in things that produce a positive cash flow or businesses that do the same. In each of the first two books, there are simple steps to move from employee to investor. <br /> <br />Rich Dad's Guide to Investing: In the final book, the author drills down into the fourth quadrant, the investor. He explores how people can move into the \\"I\\" quadrant while staying in one of the other quadrants. This book is really a financial literacy book. Here Kiyosaki demystifies what financial literacy is all about, what you need to know to start investing, and what it takes to succeed long term in the \\"I\\" quadrant.  <br /> <br />He also deals with the feelings that this whole process is likely to raise in the average person--like what happens when you make an investment mistake (and you will)? Do you become a liar, a blamer, a justifier, a quitter, or a denier (there's one more--the only place to really go--but you'll have to read the book to find that out! <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: If you want to be either a business owner or an investor this series of books should not only be on your bookshelf, but read, underlined, and applied. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

Although this story is written for younger ages, it is a great story none the less. Richter tells this story as a first person narrative writing in a simple but elegant way. It depicts the childhood of Richter and his friendship with his Jewish friend Friedrich. One really gets a good idea of the way Jews were treated in the 1930's and 40's by others influenced by the new Nazi party. Richter's story also gives you an idea of how the Holocaust tore apart families and friendships. This is an excellent story, that will really take you away with the author's excellent story telling and very personal narrative.	2005-10-12

If Michel Foucault's work has created a new discursive space, then Giorgio Agamben's work has driven a chasm between the existing spaces of between public law and political fact.  Agamben has attempted to define that ambiguous space, to fill it with a description that gives it a tenuous position in the lexicon of modern political theory.  Whether it is a \\"point of imbalance\\" or \\"no man's land\\" (1), a \\"zone of undecidability\\", or a \\"paradoxical phenomenon\\" (2) a \\"threshold of indeterminacy\\" (3) or a \\"fictitious lacuna\\" (31) Agamben has embarked on describing the indescribable, even though the concept is \\"matched by terminological uncertainty\\" (4).  Expanding on the ideas expounded by Schmitt and Benjamin, Agamben asserts that the state of exception he describes is no longer a temporary state in times of war or siege, but that it \\"tends to increasingly appear as the dominant paradigm of government in contemporary politics\\" (2).  Whether it is now the dominant paradigm or, as Agamben argues, the state of exception \\"has by now become the rule\\" (9) may be of scholarly debate.  Agamben does make a good argument that this state he describes is becoming more prevalent especially after the events of September 11, 2001 have brought the United States into this war on terrorism.  This timely essay seems to fit well within this age of security and surveillance brought forth by the Patriot Act and the more recent state of exception from hurricanes Rita and Katrina.	2005-10-12

Being a sincere student of Advaita Vedanta (Non-duality) for many years and inspired by the works of Gangaji, Ramana Maharshi, Satyam Nadeen and others, I find David Hawkins's book a major contribution to this body of spiritual Truth and Knowledge. Speaking from the unique perspective of a medical scientist and Self Realized Soul, Hawkins is able to language his experience in a uniquely linear and nonlinear fashion that speaks eloquently to the Western mind. Being a psychiatrist, he can couch his experience and explain the Self Realization process in both a psychological and spiritual context that penetrates the right brain as well as the left. The Truth quotient, based on his callibration system, scores very high and I found simply reading this book raised my consciousness and revealed inner Truth and Revelation beyond the printed word. Truly, this book is blessed as any great spiritual volume, and thus it has the ability to dramatically shift awareness from the self to the Self. This is profound! I can not rate this book high enough! It is a priceless Jewel.	2005-10-12

As i just said, i enjoyed the book very much, and true i did not understand half of what the man said, but if you truely love physics i think you can get something out of this. Maybe im strange, but i enjoyed this book so much. One great thing about it was the fact of his view on string theory. Not often will one find such a view as he has on the subject and it has lead me to question my earlier views on the subject. Also, I had never heard of Twistor Theory before and now i see it has some value and that i may start to persue it in my college career along with the new versions of string theory with 4 deminsions that he spoke of.  Over all, people who give this book a bad rating, just are not seeing the book for what it is. And that is a general guide to the most important theories, one that may not be the most percise at every turn, nook and craney, but one that is a great 1045 page guide to things in general and help people see the elegance in the math involved in physics.	2005-10-12
US	16516837	RG39M04VK3CD0	0156027321	843703088	Life of Pi	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Great Animal Book	I've been trying to figure out why this book stands out as possibly the best of the fifteen I have read this year.  Surely because it was the Booker Prize winner.  I think, in large part, it is also because this novel honors animals in an almost mythological way, not surprisingly, perhaps, because the narrator Pi is himself of the  Hindu faith, as well as being part Muslim and part Christian. \\"Life Of Pi\\" makes animals seem if anything more important in the chain of being than humans. This is a habit of thought that may have been lost in urbanized modern society, though it wasn't too many decades ago that even American farmers were dependent upon animals for transportation and for work in a way that we are now dependent upon the internal combustion engine.  There are other books that do so (possibly Rudyard Kipling's \\"The Jungle Book,\\"; perhaps \\"The Lion King\\", though I don't know \\"The Lion King\\" very well; certainly American Indian  and apparently Hindu mythology.)The other novel that I have read recently that comes the closest to achieving this same effect is John Nicols' remarkable  \\"The Milagro Beanfield War\\" which does so by also telling a very human story about traditional New Mexican farmers, and also, to a lesser extent, its sequel \\"Nirvana Blues\\" which has certain elements of Hindu religion--in particular monkey worship-- as part of the plot. All of the above  anthropomorphize animals in a very positive way. \\"Life Of Pi\\" does so by placing Pi on a liferaft in very close proximity with animal refugees from a zoo after a freighter sinks, and Pi, after losing his family,  also encounters numerous denizens of the sea, fish, reptile,mammal and fowl, on his 200-plus day ocean journey. In the early part of the book, Pi reflects on his early life as son of a zoo keeper in French India and the tone of respect for animals is consistent in these early sections as well, even when he describes why he believes animals are better off in zoos, than in the wild, or when hereflects on the personalities of animals.  Furthermore, Pi describes his religious beliefs in these early sections. It may have been a stroke of luck, but this book is exceptionally well written, concise and not overblown. It also includes many passages,naturally, about survival skills.	2005-10-12

He's gonna get to see his great love Kyoko in a revealing swimsuit as he agrees to take little brat Kentaro to the beach. It's too bad that his rival, tennis coach Mitaka is also along for the ride. But he has one thing on his side! Mitaka is deathly afraid of dogs, including Kyoko's Mr. Soichiro. Maybe Yusaku will get to show his macho side and prove he's the better man? That's if he can endure Mitaka and Kyoto going out on a date. Yusaku himself has his own miniature shojo romance going too, when he meets up with Kozue, a former co-worker, when he's desperate for a date. <br /> <br />Rumiko Takahashi is a master, or should I say mistress, of creating awesome and endearing characters. Her designs are beautiful and her style is very recognizable. The great thing about Maison Ikkoku is that no single element overwhelms you. The comedy, romance, and at times deep emotion all work in harmony with each other. Very well written and funny. Masterpiece.	2005-10-12

Knowing what awaited me in the second part, and having lived through 9/11 myself as a NYC resident in 2001, I had great hopes for what lay ahead. But for me, the entire plot quickly short circuited,leaving literary fragments in its wake.

To look at the cover you'd think this was the book version of a made-for-TV movie about that evil group the Taliban, probably starring several of Hollywood's younger stars and with a formulaic plot that starts out irrelevant and only gets worse. Funny thing, when you get past the cover, there's a lot more inside this book than you'd expect. <br /> <br />Ahmed Rashid turns out to be a serious, balanced journalist, with a very objective point of view and an almost unblinking eye for the misdeeds of governments and individuals. He has written for years for the Far Eastern Economic Review, and while there coined the phrase \\"New Great Game\\" to describe the competition between the United States and Russia over Central Asia's gas and oil resources and the transport corridors to move these to market. This book is the product of his writing about the region for most of the period covered, and appears to have been constructed from the ground up: there's no disclaimer in the front telling you that part of this book was originally an article in a periodical somewhere. <br /> <br />The book was finished prior to 9/11. In fact, even the USS Cole bombing hadn't happened yet when he finished writing, so the references to Osama bin Laden restrict themselves to crediting him with the East African embassy bombings in the late 90s. This means the reader gets a valuable look at the Taliban and by extension Al Quaeda before we all had our opinions of them colored by the attacks of 9/11. Interestingly, the book in this regard only reinforces the opinion I already held: the Taliban were lunatics who had no clue how to run a government and respect other people's rights, and were uninterested in learning. <br /> <br />If I have a quarrel with the book it's the writing style. The author is a journalist, but he doesn't write for Newsweek or the Washington Post. His sentences are long and full of either unneccessary commas or missing ones, making the phrasing hard to follow, and sometimes his thoughts are difficult to discern. Throughout the book he abbreviates things, and since he only once tells you what the abbreviations stand for, it can get a bit confusing. A glossary of abbreviations and terms would have been a good idea. The print is small and the pages are full of type: the margins (especially the bottom one) are among the smallest I've ever seen professionally printed. Though this book is only 200+ pages, it is actually much longer than that would make it appear. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this book a great deal, and other than the difficult prose I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.	2005-10-12

These co-authors have written for an audience that will already be convinced of the worthwhileness of their thesis, i.e., that America is the new \\"chosen land.\\" For a non-American, looking  backwards in history from the present day,the argument is not quite so convincing. Certainly, the faith and courage exhibited by the earliest pioneeers makes for inspirational reading and, to be fair, the authors work quite hard to sustain the impetus of their presentation. The narrative lags seriously in a few places and the writers' uncertainties are made apparent to the reader, which hardly adds to the power of the argument.  As a work of historical criticism it rates about one star but because the anecdotes are interesting I rated it at two stars.	2005-10-12

Upon reading it, I only felt filled with much more anxiety about the whole process in part because of its ommissions.  While there are whole chapters on the emotional aspects of the deployment, most of the information is general and useless.  Some of it appears to just have been cut and pasted from other books that have no relation to deployment or military life.   Giving only one spouse's perspective is another weakness.  The author only experienced Marine deployments and treated 1 year overseas deployments as outside the norm.  For Army families, they are common and there is very little information about what to do when a spouse is gone for more than six months.  It, like most deployment counseling, offers no help to the families who are not integrated in to a unit - and therefore have no FRG which \\"Surviving Deployment\\" laziliy suggests turning to for all questions left unanswered.	2005-10-12

The third appendix is especially good since it lists ten important internet sites.<br /><br />There's only one major problem with this book: it's way too long.  It is too long because Dement wants to tell his biography at the same time and give anecdotal stories.  The result is that the reader has to read through all this detail before encountering a point of importance.  This problem gets worse as one proceeds through the book.  Summary pages of key points at the end of each chapter would have been most helpful.<br /><br />However, this problem does not make the book unworthy of reading since the information conveyed is important.

Reacher is a retired Army MP Major who left the service because the downsized military after the fall of the Soviet Union left him with too small a field of play.  He spends his days now, traveling about, seeing the things he missed as a career soldier.  He gets off a Greyhound bus in the middle of Georgia to visit the birthplace of a blues musician his brother once recommended to him.  What he encounters is an almost immediate arrest for the gruesome murder of an unidentified victim.  Reacher is able to prove he wasn't even in the state at the time of the killing, and offers a tip to the sheriff about how to identify the body.  His tip was successful, but devastating to Reacher, as he learns that the body is that of his brother, a US Treasury agent on assignment.  Reacher makes finding the killers his own responsibility and leads the reader through a tale of local corruption, brutal adversaries and close calls for himself and the beautiful deputy who befriends him.  A great adventure read that mixes the technical detail of a Clancy novel with the almost superhuman capability of a James Bond type hero.	2005-10-12

This book has very interesting pacing.  The first chapter explodes with a stoning of a prostitute and introduces the jailer and one of the people who did the stoning.  The book then calms down, introduces a few more characters, and then builds and builds until the climax.<br /><br />This reminded me a lot more of a short story than it did of a novel, even though it's 200 pages long.  The story is very tight, and just like when I've read a really good short story, I felt like I didn't get all of the intricacies in the story.<br /><br />This book is translated from French, and I think that the translator used much bigger words than were really needed, but it surprisingly didn't take away too much from the book.  Besides the vocabulary, the translation was very good.<br /><br />I also think this is an interesting story regardless of the setting.  I don't know much about politics or current events, but was still very intrigued by the whole story.<br /><br />This story is a tragedy.  I love tragedies, and that's what fascinated me most about this book.	2005-10-12

Like the more famous ivory-billed woodpecker, the marbled murrelet is an elusive bird which has chosen exclusively a limited territory depleted trough logging. Though not on the edge of extinction, the many human threats to its habitat are reducing its numbers, and naturalist author Maria Mudd Ruth here explores these influences - and her discoveries about an amazing bird.	2005-10-12

The story is described in the third person following dashing hero Dirk Pitt and loyal friend, Al Giordino as well as following the diabolical villains.  It is a story filled with danger and action combined with amazing descriptions.  Recommended age 14 and up for innuendoes and descriptions of violent events.   <br /> <br />  This novel is not a simple read, but it is not cut and dry either.  Cussler is and amazing author who has a gift for expressing description and emotion.  Even though the story is told in third person, as a reader you get a real feel for the characters and become amerced in the story.  The story is mostly centered on the charming Dirk Pitt, an unusual hero who always manages to land on his 1feet.  Pitt is not a common hero, his features are attractive, but not quite movie star quality so he relies on his wit and people skills to help him `get in the door' so to speak.  From the first three pages I was lost in this book.  Cussler does an amazing job setting up descriptions to make the reader feel like they are in those places and know those people.  The quote \\"his large brown hands moved efficiently, pulling back on the control column and the plane aimed its flat snout at the sun\\", is a taste at some of the imagery and description used.  I spent a majority of this book wanting to be there, wanting to be in the action.  Cussler is truly a gifted writer who embraces his spirit of adventure.   <br />	2005-10-12

The Sister Brides series by Lynne Graham is wonderful, because the thread of each sister's story picks up in the next book so we get to find out more about the beloved characters we left behind, and the new things that have happened in their lives.  I love that!<br /><br />This title is the first telling the stories of sisters Freddie, Misty & Ione.  Freddie is a gentle family-oriented heroine that uses any means at her disposal to protect her nephew, which sets us off on  an emotional story spanning the equator in the intriquing story of  both Freddie & Jaspar, the sexy and honorable hero in this tale.  Lynne Graham's description of Jaspar is enough to make the ladies swoon!<br /><br />I am not about to cast religious stones across fictional borders, and think that any culture that is not being bashed would be thankful that theirs is one being written favorably about; so I am somewhat confused by the post below.  There is definitely not any bashing going on in this book IMHO, but I understand that everyone takes offense in varying degrees, so I'll just say that I did not get a negative impression of Arab men at all; in fact, if I wasn't already married....<br /><br />Plus, Lynne Graham's heroes are *all* oversexed.

As a result of reading this book, I now have a greater appreciation for the art of baseball memorabilia. I would recommend this book to those who recall their childhood card collections with fondness as well as to fans of the game of baseball itself.   <br /> <br />The author has combined an insider's knowledge of baseball memorabilia with a reverence for the history of the game and an understanding of the game's place within American culture. It is clear from the book's essays that he knows how intertwined baseball and America really are. The book's pictures make these one-of-a-kind private collections appear like the works of art that many of them truly are.  <br /> <br />In addition to well-known baseball memorabilia (the Honus Wagner baseball card, Babe Ruth's bats), the author has an eye for unusual private collections. One of my favorites in the book was the person who focused his collection on Moe Berg, an Ivy League grad and backup catcher in the majors during the 1930s who spoke six languages and served in the Office of Strategic Services, the precursor of the CIA, during World War II. I also had no idea that Penny Marshall (director of \\"A League of Their Own\\"), who is featured in the book, is such an avid baseball memorabilia collector.  <br /> <br />A great gift for baseball fans of all ages.	2005-10-12

Raymond Brown and Joseph Fitzmyer, among others, put together the premier modern Catholic biblical commentary in the late 1960s in \\"The Jerome Biblical Commentary.\\"  A little over 20 years later, they offer this updated version.  The preparation, as noted in the Foreward, involved inter-denominational studies and the volume (it is hoped) will play a part in ecumenical efforts.  This is not suprising given the late Fr. Brown's association with Union Theological Seminary and Fr. Fitzmyer's experise in Aramaic and Judaic studies.<br /><br />The commentary itself is accessible to the intelligent, theologically informed layperson.  It is of special value for clergy or academics.  My priest uses it for homiletic background research.  The commentary reflects a modern critical approach to which many traditionalists may disagree.  I find it to be sensible and conform to my understanding of the modern scientific textual approach.  And while concise, this oversized book still comes in at almost 1500 pages.  I use this commentary along with NAB Study Bible footnotes and various Anchor Bible commentaries for my personal study and Catholic work.  I contrast it with my NIV Study Bible notes and a few other commentaries for my interfaith communications.<br /><br />Of particular interest to me are the topical articles written by experts in their fields.  The articles take up the issues of Inspiration (what it is, how it has been understood, its authority and source, its history), Canonicity (an examination of the history of what is considered \\"scripture\\"), Apocrpypha and other Jewish Literature, Texts and Versions (Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic targums, etc.), Modern Old Test. Criticism, Modern New Test. Criticism, Hermeneutics and so on.

Truth to be told, I plan to buy this book even though I have already read it, due to the fact that it is the kind of book you just want to have. This book includes several essays and articles written by J. H. H. Weiler on European integration, from different points of view. That variety can be seen simply by reading the titles of some of the essays in this book, for example \\"The transformation of Europe\\", \\"Introduction: the reformation of European constitutionalism\\", \\"European democracy and its critics: polity and system\\" and \\"To be an European citizen: Eros and civilization\\".<br /><br />Those essays were written by the author during a period of 10 years, and were finally revised, updated (when it was necessary) and compiled in this book, released in 1999. According to Weiler, he considered rewriting all these essays into a monograph, but settled on keeping their format in order to allow the reader to choose exactly what he wanted to read, according to his interests and available time. In Weiler's own words, \\"I expect that no one will read all the essays and articles in this book- not even my own doctoral students. But I do hope that many more will read some of its essays and articles that would be the case if this were a scholarly monograph of equal size\\".<br /><br />I specially liked the fact that every chapter (that is, each individual essay) can be read as a standalone, because I think that allows everybody to choose exactly where to begin reading this book, and gives the opportunity of not reading something if the theme isn't particularly appealing. Despite that, if you start this book because you are interested in one particular chapter, it is highly likely you will end up reading at least some of the others, as the writer's engaging writing style will tempt you to go on reading. Also, and from the point of view of a non-native English speaker (my case), it is a pleasure to read something that is so well-written...<br /><br />All in all I can say that all these essays and articles are highly interesting, and allow the reader to learn something more about European integration, as a process, an ideal and a reality everybody has to deal with. In my opinion, this book somehow manages to tackle quite well both the structure and ends of European Integration, and that is no easy task. Whether you are a student or someone who is just interested in the subject, I recommend this book as great reading material that allows you to read exactly what you find interesting and at your own pace.<br /><br />Belen Alcatoint of view of a non-native English speaker (my case), it is a pleasure to read something that is so well-written...

Kurt's personal thoughts never meant for public consumption released by his ex-wife after his tragic death. I justified buying it as I wanted to try to learn who Kurt really was? What he actually thought and felt on a number of subjects. How he reacted in particular circumstances. I wanted to try and get a look into his persona without all the spins, etc. I can't say that the book answered all these questions but they did reveal aspects of Cobain which don't seem to be in the forefront. It seems so much of what's been written about him and Nirvana are in conflict. No one seems to be able to agree on much about them for certain other than the fact that they were an independant, original punk-metal-pop band brought all soon to an end by the death of Cobain. This book does offer good insight directly from Kurt however it seems even he couldn't resist contradictory statements and actions. I think to a large degree he enjoyed such confusion feeling that to much attention was spent on things other than their music! I'd recommend the book to anyone who is fascinated by the band. It won't answer all the questions and you will feel like your violating his personal space but it can provide some sense of understanding a few aspects of the man.	2005-10-12

There is also an evil stepmother who, if even only 25% of the things Wilsey says happened are true, definitely lives up to that title and all it implies.  The book goes on to detail the author's many, many, many mistakes as a child and teenager (including theft, drugs, terrible grades, a series of expulsions, socially maladjusted behavior, etc), the many ways his parents (most specifically, his father and stepmother) attempt to \\"fix\\" these problems to no avail, and the way in which he finally healed himself.  Many of the situations and locales in the book are straight-up insane.  Wilsey's writing is expressive, concise and funny.  The early passages in particular are especially good; the ways in which he remembers and describes things from his early childhood (though some of it is almost certainly embellished or exaggerated) and captures a specific feeling are most impressive.  While the book is quite long and could no doubt be cut in length, it is nevertheless an extremely compulsive read, if only because I couldn't believe that his family life was so horrendous.  Clearly, Wilsey's accounts of certain events (mainly those involving the wicked stepmother) are biased and twisted, but nobody ever said a memoir had to be objective.  There are many cringeworthy moments in the book due to Wilsey's blunt style, but the reader comes away with respect for his accomplishments despite what happened to him in the past.  Highly recommended!	2005-10-12

The idea of bringing dinosaurs back to life will resonate with anyone who has ever been fascinated by these amazing creatures. Crichton's science, although fictional, seems so utterly plausible, and that makes it all the more magical and frightening. The writing is smooth and fluid, moving seamlessly from one episode to the next, and eventually effortlessly weaving several storylines together. The reader is hooked from the very first page. Don't start this book late at night! <br /> <br />The only places where the action lags is when the character of Ian Malcolm discourses on scientific and environmental ethics. The character is obviously a mouthpiece for Crichton himself, and although the ideas he presents are definitely thought-provoking, they come off as a little preachy and heavy-handed. <br /> <br />This is a terrific book, full of suspense, clever ideas, and likeable characters.	2005-10-12

The theme in the novel is \\"romance.\\"    This book wasn't hard but it wasn't easy, I guess you could say it was just in the middle.  Garry Disher uses a lot of imagery in his writing.  He does a good job describing the characters feelings.  The main character \\"hart\\" has a very stressful life between his mom leaving him and then dieing and because his father doesn't pay attention to him.  If it wasn't for his sister \\"Alice\\" who is also his best friend, Hart would be nothing.  Hart has had a crush on \\"Misty\\" forever, but for some reason she doesn't go for him.  Misty is also Alice's best friend.  This novel shows a fight for love.  Hart wants to be with Misty so bad, it breaks his heart that he can't have her.  It's hard because Misty is Japanese and Hart is Australian.  There's a war going on in the novel against Japan.  Hart's father is on the Australian side, which makes it hard for Misty, because she came from Japan.  Throughout the novel there were a lot of tragedies in the families in the novel, which made it easy for the friends and siblings to stick together and be there for each other.   Garry Fisher is an awesome writer.  The whole time I was reading I felt like I was actually in the novel.  It was one of those novels you can't put down!   <br /> <br />	2005-10-12
US	22602626	R3LSS5XOX1AUP2	0262621088	786082000	The Trouble with Computers: Usefulness, Usability, and Productivity	Books	1	3	10	N	N	Argument in peril	This book takes the position that increasing technological infrastructure and investing in higher information technology does not increase productivity. The argument is complete hokum from beginning to end; however, it is very convincing due to the large amount of evidence presented and the prestige of the pseudoscientist promulgating it.  <br /> <br />Most of the evidence presented exemplifies the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy, which should be obvious to any logician or scientist reading it. However, several more subtle fallacies are also present. The subtlety comes in by virtue of the author failing to define `productivity.' <br /> <br />First, the author measures productivity using GDP. This is analogous to using the physics definition of work when you ask a man who's spent all day trying to tip over a mountain, \\"Why are you so tired? The mountain hasn't moved, therefore you haven't done any work!\\" GDP is a measure of output in terms of dollars. It does not measure work done, just how much was sold.  <br /> <br />Second, the author uses return on assets to analyze investments in new equipment. Now, I'm no expert in finance, but since assets is in the denominator, using ROA in the way this author does (the ROA of the firm, not the investment decision) would systematically understate the positive effects of these investments. Net Present Value or Internal Rate of Return would both be much better measures. <br /> <br />Third, and this is related to the second point, the author compares firms to what they were in the past (before investing in technology) or to other, dissimilar firms. The relevant comparison is between a firm's current profitability and what the current profitability would have been if not for the investment. The common form of this reasoning is: XYZ Corp. made a huge technological investment in 1986, and experienced no rise in productivity (as measured by ROA). This ignores the possibility that the whole industry became more competitive, and failing to invest in the technology could have led to bankruptcy.  <br /> <br />In a related issue, he completely ignores rising standards. His argument is equivalent to, Finding Nemo did not make significantly more money than The Lion King. Therefore, enhanced technology did not increase productivity. This is incorrect because productivity is a measure of work done over time, not money made. If animators tried to make a film with the graphics quality of Finding Nemo by hand, it would have taken several orders of magnitude longer, if it was even possible! The fact is, the animators, like so many workers in society, get far more done today than they used to, they just don't get paid anymore to do it, which is actually an argument for the value of technology. <br /> <br />I gave up on it shortly thereafter.	2005-10-12

A tale introducing two radically different and contrary main characters, Nathaniel the apprentice and Bartimeus the powerful and clever djinni. The book focuses on their strained relaltionship and differs from the Harry Potter books in its portrayal of magic as the conjuring and subsequent binding of mischievous spirits, rather than spellslinging and waving of wands. \\"Cthuluesque\\" could be a good description of the Bartimeus-magic, when the mythology-part is slightly subratracted from the lot. The idea of a Britain run by a stuck-up class of magicians, takes some time to get used to, but eventually works. The language is fluent and does not strand with any particular age-category.

He remarked, at a booksigning I attended, that he found his informal survey \\"inspiring\\" because he met so many enterprising and creative self-employed people, and his enthusiasm comes through strongly.  But this isn't a simplistic, rah-rah book;  he's frank about the pitfalls and drawbacks of self-employment, and his chapter on temp workers, while brief, is a good overview of their dubious situation. <br /> <br />I don't agree with all of his opinions, but I think that his main point is dead on:  The \\"organization man\\" world of paternalistic corporations and loyal drones is dead.  In fact, we all work for ourselves;  while this insight may be unsettling to some, not only does \\"free agency\\" offer greater opportunities for meaningful work, but it's closer to the way \\"work\\" has historically been performed. <br /> <br />Having been a free agent myself for most of my working life, I strongly agree that the infrastructure needs to adapt.  Although there have been great improvements in the tax code, the insurance business, and individual retirement plans in the past 20 years, they're still tailored to either (1) full-time employees who are paid a fixed salary with benefits, or (2) those who work on commission.  So I applaud this book for bringing these issues more into public awareness, and thus helping to stimulate further change.	2005-10-12

To the author of the review \\"The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time, July 25 2005 \\" I say: I have not read this book as of yet (so please excuse the 5 stars but I had to put it in to post this) but as a person who has read and enjoyed Douglas Adams I find it offensive that you tie his death to some supposed plan by \\"God\\" to off  Douglas Adams because he did not like his literature.  By that reckoning a lot of writers should be dead because they have \\"angered the gods\\" with their sacrilegious words. But even more writers should be dead because they have written atrocious junk, which should piss off \\"god\\" more than having a sense of humor about ourselves and how we perceive ourselves in the universe. I do not know Douglas Adams personally but I think that he would laugh if a self righteous GOD enveloped him in a ball of flame besides, \\"What god would be hanging around Heathrow trying to catch the 3:37 to Oslo?\\".  The point is you or I cannot perceive what god is or his plan so stop trying and Live for \\"Gods\\" sake!!!

I liked this book, but found myself far removed from loving it. The characters are unlikable, the situation they are in, given from the protagonist's standpoint is highly depressing, and the outcome from the beginning of the novel is surely going to end badly. Without totally ruining the book, the only thing that made this book good was also what made it a trial to read. The 'battle personas' that people put on, and the way people change in battle are as true in the book as in real life, and reflect military life very well and in a very realistic fashion.  <br /> <br />However, what is odd is that Crane's vision ends with a grain of wisdom for the protagonist, and I think it is perhaps received a little too easily. Why would the youth go through countless situations without proper attainment of some kind of wisdom, entering into the futile cycle of war and glory in his mind, and somehow come up with a satisfying answer without any kind of triggering reason for him to do so? The lack of mental cause for such a burst of wisdom and personal peace seems to be out of line with the character's personality as a whole, since from the beginning, the youth was a poor hand at self-reasoning and personal reflection. While the author may try and pass this off as 'battle experience' it is in the search for glory and the avoidance of humiliation that the youth is his worst, and yet there seems to be no reason why he should so easily shake his guilt for the terrible things that he did to his comrades earlier in the novel. I think for any soldier, such guilt would be much harder for someone to rid themselves of, and would certainly not happen immediately, as if it was an epiphany.  <br /> <br />However, even if the ending is a little unsatisfying, the book is certainly worth reading, as it has quite a bit of depth for its length. <br />	2005-10-12

I love reading the overall story of Anne, her husband Jon and children, Chloe and Ella.  It adds a very personal touch to something that I used to think of as \\"a book of food to make\\".  <br /> <br />Not only are the recipes great, the photos in this book are so fantastic-giving you a real sense of being in Maine on a windjammer.

But the Emperor, in his old age, thirsts for more power and wishes to return Japan to a time when the monarchy was predominant. So he enlists Yashamaro, a loyal and lethal swordsman, to steal the \\"Yagyu Secret Chronicles\\", mysterious documents left to the Yagyu family by a former shogun that could spark a civil war and plunge the land into darkness and despair. The Yagyu are supposed to be the guardians of the Chronicles and must retrieve them even as the Emperor tries to escape his enforced confinement to raise an army of rebels to overthrow the Shogunate! Jubei, a young Yagyu warrior and future samurai legend sets out to stop the rebellion before it starts and to recover the Chronicles, along with his half-brother Rokumaru.  <br /> <br />This was my first experience with historical manga and I wasn't disappointed.

And may or may not have been a `sniper'. <br /> <br />I finished my Marine Corps duty in 1962 so I missed both the Korean and the Vietnam wars and of course the Gulf wars, one of which is still in progress. But I have the proud recollection and continuing respect for my Corps as THE fighting man's peerless group of courageous warriors. <br /> <br />Swofford's tale of unremitting woe is focused on providing his own largely fictional experience as proving the opposite: the average Marine as thinly disguised `nancy boy' who cherishes his self-image as gutless/useless whiner. <br /> <br />I hope he is amply rewarded for his efforts by a poorly received movie, and more debt than profit. That would be SOME, but grossly inadequate, justice for this libel of the Corps. <br /> <br />If you read this book (please don't buy it for more than a plugged nickel!) and find it other than 'self-pollution', you have poor knowledge of the Marine Corps, but may be a sissified weakling yourself.	2005-10-12

Venice - the palazzi, the opera, the canals - remains unchanged by the war. But its people fail to forget. Everyone has an alibi.  <br /> <br />At a party, Adam meets the enigmatic and charming Claudia. The casual affair they begin grows into a turbulent romance.  <br /> <br />Claudia is scarred by her experience during the war. She was imprisoned for being a Jew and served as mistress to the camp's overseer in order to survive. Adam must save her from herself to save their new love.  <br /> <br />Adam's widowed mother, Grace, reunites with an old friend. Soon, she and Dr. Gianni Maglione are engaged. Adam suspects Gianni of gold-digging and Claudia accuses him of betraying her father to the Nazis. When Adam investigates Gianni's past he discovers a secret that may destroy them all.  <br /> <br />Gianni's eventual murder leaves Adam torn between justifying his own involvement and protecting the people he loves from the recent past.

Not just shot and killed, but shot in both knees and the stomach with a shotgun and left to be eaten by a rabid pack of wolves. Keep in mind that Dimebag didnt even deserve to be killed in the eyes of his shooter. The murderer was schytzophrenic, crazy, heard voices in his head. So if you are a certain 6 year old pantera hating loser, hiding behind the computor, puking his useless opinions all over the internet in a failing effort to feel important, I have a bit of advice for you. Show some respect for the dead, and keep your idiotic opinions to yourself, before somebody decides to beat some respect into you. Trust me, it wont be long at the rate your going. <br />Dimebags legacy will live longer than any of us, much like Jimi Hendrix and Randy Rhodes. For Dimebag is a true metal genious.	2005-10-12

If there is a political slant, I would argue that it is the inevitable American xenophobia that often creeps into political discourse in times of trouble. <br /> <br />As other reviewers have noted, the facts of the global supply/demand environment do not match with what Learsy is selling. He uses no facts to prop up his arguments that OPEC is gouging the US because the facts point to the opposite: <br /> <br />Consensus estimates show that OPEC is producing at as close to full capacity as possible (98%-99%). There is likely a small amount of production that is shut-in in Saudi Arabia but it is high-sulphur, low gravity (heavy) oil that wouldn't suit US refineries even if it was shipped. These numbers are readily available from any major investment firm or publicly from the International Energy Agency. <br /> <br />Secondly, Learsy conveniently ignores the fact that oil producers are price takers. Because oil is a global commodity, it is the international market that sets prices and as anyone who has been following commodity markets over the past five years has seen, the growing economies of Asia have been hungry for as much product as they can get their hands on. It is these competing buyers going after a finite supply that have sent the prices to current levels. OPEC has not been able to set prices since 2001 when there was still a surplus of global supplies and OPEC had spare capacity. <br /> <br />Finally, OPEC members may be corrupt but they are not stupid. Extremely high oil prices are a potential liability for these countries. Investments in the high-cost Canadian tar sands; deep-water offshore and politically unstable countries are a product of high prices. This increases non-OPEC supply and diminishes any last control OPEC may have over markets or influence it might buy with the US government.  <br /> <br />If you want to read a proper book analyzing the current oil situation, read Simmons book, which has a cogent theory backed-up with facts and numbers. This book is simply a materialization of classic American xenophobia looking for a convenient scapegoat to bash in a time of economic uncertainty.  <br /> <br />The world is not running out of oil, the world is running out of cheap oil. <br />	2005-10-12

This is the second book by Ms. Lewis that I've managed to read and I was truly impressed with the multiple storylines that she managed to introduce in this story, which is the first in a new series.  This story tackles some very important issues as well as demonstrates how a strong friendship can be very important in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />Annie Zook is the daughter of an Amish preacher and her place in her Amish community doesn't seem readily apparent to this young girl.  In order take her rightful place in the community and to marry the boy that she has always loved she must give up the one thing that means the most to her.  Her art.  But, Annie can't let this part of her soul go and as a result of this she has lost Rudy to someone else and she finds that this secret of hers is costing her more than she ever thought possible.  The only one that seems to understand her fears and anxieties is her friend Louisa.<br /><br /> Louisa is a pen pal that Annie has had for years and their friendship has grown with them.  They are each at a cross roads in their lives and they turn to the other.  What makes this hard is the fact that Louisa is from the outside.  Louisa on the other hand is getting ready to walk down the aisle but she's finding that the life she dreamed of just doesn't exist.  In a world of opulence she finds that she has nothing.  Her friend Annie seems to have the perfect life living in Paradise, Pennsylvania.  After canceling the wedding Louisa travels east to spend time with her good friend.  This is just what these two young women need.  Along the way these two must make adjustments but their friendship will see them through.<br /><br />This was an amazing read.  Louisa and Annie were truly wonderfully drawn characters that the reader will care about.  Although their storyline is the main one throughout the read, Ms. Lewis does introduce the touch subject of spousal abuse and the Amish way of dealing with this topic.  This secondary storyline is very important to the storyline between Louisa and Annie.  Ms. Lewis brings to life the Amish world.

The back of the book claims he has hiked over 25,000 miles in Oregon and Washington.  With so many hikes under his belt, perhaps he's starting to mix the trails up.   <br /> <br />I was excited to recieve a book with such attention to detail and variety of hiking experiences.  Indeed, there are many trails listed that are off the beaten path.  However, on two of my first treks, the instructions on how to find the trailhead were misleading or flat out wrong.  In the case of Munra Pt, Lorain instructs one to look for a gravel parking lot on the right hand side of I-84W.  The only thing on the right is the shoulder.  After a half hour of driving around looking for the non-existent gravel lot, I gave up and ended up parking on the shoulder of the east bound lanes and finding the trailhead by myself.  Another misrepresentation: Ruckel Ridge. While the directions to the parking lot were fine, from there Lorain literally and figuratively takes a wrong turn.  <br />   <br />Makes me wonder if he's ever been to those places, and defintely calls into question his reliability as well as that of the publisher, Wilderness Press.  For me this book has been a waste of time and money.     <br /> <br />My advice: if you want to find some out of the way spots, look for this book at the library for ideas of hikes, and then find out how to get there through a trusted website online.  Or just get another book.	2005-10-12

If your focus is the web this title is perfect as it covers those features of Photoshop most relevant to the design of websites. One criticism is that the design methodology in some parts is a lttle dated. The embedding of too much page and link text in images reduces a web pages chances of good search engine rankings, hence it would be better to present methods supporting the use of text based navigation using CSS, but this is my only criticism.

Before writing this review, I spent some time looking over many of the other reviews on here.  The spread is interesting, and I think it comes from a misunderstanding of the very limited scope of this book.<br /><br />First off, if you're looking for a book to explain the innate differences (if there are any?) between men and women, this is definitely not it.  Further, if you're looking for a book that dives deep into communication theory and has profound statements regarding the nature of good communication, this is equally lacking.  The title betrays the purpose.  This book is a badly written collection of common sense ideas and tactics to use when communicating in a relationship.<br /><br />Why 4 stars?  Because common sense is not as common as people think.  I am amazed at the 1-star ratings by \\"intellectuals\\" who charge that this book stands on very shaky philosophic ground, and that it does not live up to the high caliber of true scientific studies into communication fundamentals and/or gender differences.  Get a grip!  That's not the purpose of the book!<br /><br />This book is equivalent to an \\"Idiot's Guide to Listening, Respect, and Communication, with Easy-to-Remember Examples.\\"  Intellectuals charging that the common person should read XYZ's scientific study about the fundamentals is missing the basic point -- I don't want to know the fundamentals of communication (at the moment), I just want to know why my last girlfriend got offended when I offered solutions when she was complaining about work.  Sounds simple?  Not for all of us.<br /><br />I have a degree in rocket engineering and I am very confident that I could tear a book about \\"Physics for the common person\\" to ribbons for making vast over-generalizations and ignoring (what I consider to be) key details in the trade.  I could easily humble half the readers of this review if we were talking about rocket dynamics.  But would I criticize a beginner's physics book if it generates interest in my favorite subject? Of course not! You can't mock a beginner's book for not addressing the advanced issues.<br /><br />Further, it is hard to argue with the couples who say their marriage has been saved by this book.  All idealism and charges of misogynistic text aside - if it works, it works.  Period.<br /><br />I find it kind of humorous that those most offended by the generalizations made in this book are the ones most quickly to generalize.  You must remember: Not all stereotypes are false, or even bad.  When I go to China and sit down at a restaurant, I'm going to ask for chopsticks, and not forks.  Why?  Because I stereotype all people in China as eating with chopsticks.  Is this bad, or just efficient?<br /><br />Many men and women fall into the stereotypes as described in this book.  Whether or not you agree with those stereotypes as being \\"right\\" or \\"acceptable\\" is really irrelevant to the point.  Further, the stereotypes are just a method of conveying the information.  Gray is just trying to document the two different most common reactions to stress, and labels them \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" according to stereotype.  He might as well have labeled them \\"North\\" and \\"South\\" for all I care -- the point is not the male/female generalizations, the point is understanding BOTH ways of dealing with stress (talking about it or receding into thought) and how to correctly handle it when you or your partner starts doing either.<br /><br />Last, but certainly not least, let's get off the charges of women-hating.  The book is almost literally a mirror within itself, as every paragraph generalizing women has its counterpart generalizing men.  While you can charge that he mislabels both equally, those who look at this evenly stacked book and somehow derive a women-bashing lean are simply playing up their own insecurities, opinions, and political stances regarding the genders.  The book is an almost word-for-word split between the two (if you don't believe me, go back and look!).  If youcan only see the women-bashing side of things, while nonchalantly accepting all the male generalizations, then you are reading through your own mental filter, and should take a moment to consider that.<br /><br />I recommend this book to those of you who may not have the common sense that the elitist intellectuals profess, nor the ludicrous sensitivity to one side of an equally balanced portrayal of (admittedly overgeneralized) gender roles.back and look!).

The writing is adequate, the knowledge is for the most part correct, the pictures while small and elementary are serviceable, and the information is okay but frankly nothing in this book stands out as special at all. There are stepping/footwork drills, solo drills, and two person drills that are usable as a supplement for just about any Japanese sword art. There is nothing truly wrong with this book but in my mind it is about 100 pages of extraordinary averageness.

I love how he's a genius criminal mastermind and how he's so friggin smart and amazing. I loved this book (although the little parts about fairies in between the parts about Artemis himself was kind of boring) and I know this is weird, but I love how Artemis is infalliable to anything. Yes, middle end was kind of about Artemis going downhill, but he wins in the end, and so this book is almost perfect for me.

REDRUM!\\"), so if you're paying the least bit of attention you'll figure it out about halfway through at the latest.<br /><br />I really wish Lehane had come up with a better way to get this story and his themes across, because, despite its huge flaws, this book is still unsettling and extremely sad.  The last couple of chapters (after the big nonsurprise is gotten out of the way) are very moving and dark, no mean feat when you consider the cheesiness of much of what comes before (I half expected Bugs Meany to pop up as an orderly and say he remembered he took the patient back to the cell at dusk because he saw the sun setting through an eastern-facing window.  But I digress.)<br /><br />It's a shame his editor didn't send Lehane back to the drawing board to take another crack (or two) at this, because there is a lot to like here (Lehane absolutely nails the dream sequences).  Of course, if that had happened we might have ended up with a great book but a plot that would fetch a lot less in film rights.  And THAT would be criminally insane.	2005-10-12

The volume contains two stories; one is about three quarters the length of the book, the other the last quarter.<br /><br />The first story has Kohaku and the demon Koryu travelling back in time to unravel the mystery of the disappearance of Shuichiro's mother twenty-one years ago.  K & K are in their chibi forms throughout, which is a little too cute.  Added to this cuteness is Shuichiro's adorable doll-like mother, who is not human.  There are so many flowers drawn in this story I got allergies.  In a modern version of the folktale where a human man marries a celestial being, this Wish story has an unfortunate incestuous twist that is a total gross-out.  Shuichiro says to his mother as she is preparing to leave, \\"I need you.  You're the only one for me.  What if I had found you? Before Dad?\\" EWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What was CLAMP thinking?!?!?  CLAMP is known for delightful, SUBTLE homo-romanticism, but how could they think readers would be turned on or charmed by this?<br /><br />The other story is also a little too cute.  Kohaku is still a whimpering, crying chibi for most of the story.  Thankfully, this is balanced somewhat by the other sexy couple that has also taken up residence with Shuichiro.	2005-10-12

Theroux is a dyspepetic grumbler who intentionally makes himself as miserable as possible while traveling, not only because he's probably clinically depressed but also because books about things going wrong are incredibly more interesting than books about things going right.  Theroux was also traveling through Britain during a period in which the country was indeed a rather dingy place. <br /> <br />I found this book enjoyable but ultimately more evanescent than Theroux's other works.  Although he occasionally trudges through one of the more remote (and by default more engaging) parts of Britain which pique the reader's interest, most of the book is taken up by a repetitive series of trailer parks, artillery ranges and commentary on the Falklands War.  All in all, though, I'd rather read Theroux's travel guide than Lonely Planet's.	2005-10-12

An inconclusive introduction at best.     <br /> <br />I bought this book because I have trained as a chef, and because I have a passion for food, but I don't aspire to the life of a chef.  I wanted insight into how to break into alternative divisions of the industry, such as wine, gourmet food, small business ideas, etc.  Such information is not to be found in any useful degree here.  Rather, this book rarely spends more than a half page paragraph under any one heading,  for instance, in describing the various posts within a typical restaurant kitchen, or going into possibilities beyond the restaurant kitchen.    <br /> <br />It strikes me that there is virtually nothing in this book that cannot be determined simply by using common sense in thinking about the industry.  So unless you literally know nothing about it, I cannot recommend this book for anyone looking for new ideas or real insight into the food/gourmet genre.	2005-10-12

I think Vince Flynn should consider a little hiatus from writing to gather together some new ideas. This one just doesn't cover much ground that he or others haven't already done better. Even Flynn's hero Mitch Rapp seems a little tired this time around, though he gets around very well for being fresh out of knee surgery - and the villains are plywood cutouts of a sinister kind. The only upside, and it's a decent one, is that the action scenes are engaging and fun, in a style that few if any can put to paper as well as this author.    Sometimes it might be better not to drag out a new title just to meet that contract obligation. If you're the sort that eats the same sandwich every day and doesn't mind, maybe give Consent to Kill a read. But I recommend sticking with Flynn's Transfer of Power, Executive Power, or Mute by Brad Steel if you want fresh and different.	2005-10-12

But as a writer, I must caution aspiring writers about some of the advice King gives in this book. He describes his forumla for drafting as a first draft, second draft, and a third which is essentially a 'polish'. He also disparages plotting, going as far as calling writers who plot mediocre. This is a bum steer; there are many great books written using this method. Also key is the careful, almost obsessive redrafting, going over one's work with a fine-tooth comb, pure elbow grease. There is not enough emphesis on that part of the job, and King is one of the only writers I have ever read who neglect to emphasise the importance of careful and laborious revision.    If you are a King fan, you will enjoy the insight into King's life and work, told in entertaining style as we've come to expect. But if you are a serious aspiring writer, look elsewhere for advice on the craft. King is not a help to you here, and maybe King didn't realize what was at stake by giving bad adive ... a young writer could waste years going about the job in the wrong way.	2005-10-12

She has learned that one in three wives cheats on her husband. And she seems to state her case well and to have achieved balance and professionalism in her book by, \\"sounding off, mulling over and conceptualizing\\" with psychologists, social workers, physicians, authors, therapists, psychiatrists, teachers, counselors, colleagues, family and friends. While some of the frankness relayed might seem to promote infidelity, balance is maintained as the drawbacks are explained. The 4-page index and the 4-page bibliography are helpful. This was 1981, but I suspect that the main issues live on. <br /> <br />GENERAL PROFILE OF ONE WHO CHEATS:  guilt-free; not religious, high-energy; attractive; working outside the home; 30's-40's (at the outset); middle class; psychologically normal; raised consciousness; takes charge; exploits familiar situations and \\"good\\" timing; respectable in community; considerate of husband and children; practical; a risk-taker; not easily swept off her feet; excited by \\"forbidden fruit\\"; hungry to give and receive good love; tends toward emotional involvement. <br /> <br />***PROBLEMS AND INTENTIONS*** <br /> <br />ENVIRONMENT AND INITIATION: Beginning in childhood, women are now in a more sexualized environment in which the restrictions on pleasure are no longer rigidly enforced. \\"Even children's sexuality is on display. Commercials for status jeans for children use explicit sexual references.\\" <br /> <br />WORK VS. NOVELTY: For some there is a basic incompatibility between the work of sustaining a marriage and family and \\"that terrific romantic feeling of walking on clouds\\" that one may feel early in her married years or during a love affair with someone who is not shouldering marriage and family responsibilities for her. <br /> <br />DEPRIVATION: Ask the monkeys or the prisoners - deprived of species contact they deteriorate. Same thing can happen to your wife if you effectively abandon her for education, career, volunteerism, spirituality, recreation, entertainment - whatever. No matter if you think that everything you do is for the social and economic well-being of her and your family, if that one-on-one contact with your wife is not her-oriented, is not of high quality and is not frequent and of significant duration, she may run in desperation to another man for these comforts and stimulations. <br /> <br />CRISES: For many women an overwhelming crisis heralds their first love affair. I wonder whether it sometimes isn't just the complex problems that often confront families (child care, physical health, mental health, economics, education, socializing, in-laws, jobs, teamworking...). Perhaps an accumulation of these problems can produce a crisis if, for example the husband is too tired/unable/disbelieving/combative/disinclined/absent to brainstorm with his wife. She may just need someone who actually understands or seeks to understand her problems and is willing to discuss them. Perhaps the sex for some is just a way of keeping the mentoring going. Warren Bennis seems to describe an analog in his book, On Becoming a Leader, as he relates how industry leaders accept mentoring in order to tackle complex problems. <br /> <br />CHILDREN AND PRIORITY: If the couple puts their children's needs first, that can easily erase the parents' relationship as romantic lovers. <br /> <br />JEALOUSY WITHIN THE FAMILY: When a husband is overly solicitous to an adolescent daughter who is just realizing her own sexuality, that may combine with poor parenting teamwork, in the case of problem children and adolescents, to trigger an affair. <br /> <br />SEX AND JOB STATUS: In discussing women who trade sex for job power the author is surprisingly objective. <br /> <br />FUN: A small number insist that their love affairs are just for fun and that they have no problems at home. <br /> <br />***RESPONSES*** <br /> <br />COPING: Most wives cope with each problem as it comes up. Others may break down physically or emotionally, or turn to alcohol, or run, or start divorce proceedings. Still others may opt to continue the marriage, but with a lover on the side. For some \\"It's easier to solve the marital crisis by having a lover than trying to fix up the relationship with your husband.\\" Some expressed that their love affairs improved their relationships with their husbands, children and coworkers, as they had been brought out of depression. <br /> <br />CHOICE OF LOVER: (quoting an interviewee, and then the author) \\"If they are not married they are not worth having.\\" \\"Some will specifically exclude an affair with a married man who is unhappy.\\" <br /> <br />NETWORKING: Women tend to recognize when each other are having affairs and may tend to cover for each other. <br /> <br />OPEN MARRIAGE:  Dr. Shirley Zussman, VP of the American Assn of Sex Educators, Counsellors and Therapists, claims that she has never seen an \\"open marriage\\" (no secrets) that worked. She considers it not to be a viable lifestyle. <br /> <br />***EFFECTS*** <br /> <br />THERAPY (Interviewees):  \\"...a new romance works better than penicillin.\\" \\"A new man is a sure-fire aphrodisiac.\\"  \\"...better than a psychiatrist.\\" <br /> <br />CHILDREN AND EFFECTS: \\"...the children suffer. They're losing part of their mother's concentration...No matter how hard she tries, her thoughts are on her lover... (However) I felt no guilt about my husband....\\" <br /> <br />MORALITY: They tend to feel that their (well-managed) love affairs are less damaging to their families than divorce, abandonment, economic exploitation or even their own depression.  <br /> <br />GUILT (Journalist): A woman's guilt \\"appears to decline in direction proportion to her level of fulfillment and satisfaction with `outsidesex.'\\" <br /> <br />REGRET: \\"Married women who have had an affair, however much they get caught in the crossfire of their conscience and their needs, very rarely regret it...\\" <br /> <br />ENTITLEMENT: Women \\"are beginning to assume the same unsaid rights that men have long assumed.\\" Desperation, boredom and longing may have motivated her affair, but she tends to relate that she deserved it. <br /> <br />***CONCLUSION***  <br /> <br />\\"When there is an abundance of love and respect in a marriage, sexual fidelity is no sacrifice.\\" <br /> <br />This review in its necessary sketchiness cannot do justice to the book. Do read it! <br /> <br /> <br />Bill Norwood <br />	2005-10-12

It's well written and informative but also redundant for anyone who's read \\"The Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\" by Charlie Papazian, \\"Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide\\" by Dave Miller, or \\"Homebrewing For Dummies\\" by Marty Nachel.  If this was one the first books I had read on homebrewing, I would probably be a big fan and refer to this book all the time.  Since I came to this book after reading the above mentioned books, the information is completely redundant.  There are some tables in the \\"Recipe Formulation\\" chapter that are well organized and useful, outside of that, there is nothing new here.  The rest of the book consists of recipes, largely extract.  Again, if this was the first or second book I had ever read on homebrewing, I would find this all fascinating and would probably refer to it all the time but it's not.  The three books mentioned above have all the same information and plenty of similar recipes. <br />     I love homebrewing and I love reading books on beer and homebrewing techniques.  If you started with this book, I can understand why you would be attached to it.  If you're browsing for a good first book on homebrewing, however, I would recommend \\"The New Complete Joy Of Homebrewing\\" by Papazian, \\"Dave Miller's Homebrewing Guide\\" by Dave Miller, and \\"Homebrewing For Dummies\\" by Nachel over this book.  This book appears to have been written in a vacuum as if the author was not aware that most of this information is already out there.	2005-10-12

I've reviewed Lindsey Davis' FALCO mysteries before, and always rated them highly--something they deserved--for local color, human interest, scholarship, wit, and unusually good writing. <br /> <br />This one goes nowhere.  It's plodding, devoid of Falco's usual mental and physical exertions.  There's little if any character development except that Helena's brother Aelianus seems to be maturing and mellowing. Falco is acted upon, rather than being his usual competent and courageous self, someone who controls the denouement of the plot.  He makes an inordinate number of errors and bad judgments.  His actions turn to dust, and at the end nothing really has changed except that a sour widow has unnecessarily died. <br /> <br />The humor in all the others is missing here; instead there's a deep cynicism.  I'm sure Davis will hit her stride again, but this is the least important novel in the series.	2005-10-12

Then I figured it out. Sylvia Plath's brilliance is contained in her poetry. Her book does convey her message quite well (at least what most people consider the message to be) and it is fantastically well written and contains many of the contrasts and comparisons betweeen two seemingly very unrelated things, which distinguishes her work, but it lacks luster. It seems great upon first read, but when compared to her poetry, it is like a candle that is lit, but sputtering. I think her book is a more logical explanation of her madness, but it doesn't make her seem like she is mentally ill. She makes you feel like she is healthy and the rest of the world is sick. Kudos for putting us in her shoes. But aside from that, the rest of the story seems drab, despite the imagery. It didn't evoke many feelings in me. I think literature is meant to stir and inspire. But maybe she just wanted us to feel nothing at all, as if we were trapped under a bell jar and the only thing you can feel is the pain which is so persistant that eventually you become used to it and don't feel it anymore. I guess that's the reason I didn't like the book as well as I should have. She intended for us to feel nothing at all.	2005-10-12

This simply appears to be a marketing trick to make people buy it.  It does at least explain why Thor is absent during the Avengers Disassembled arc, but that's a pretty weak link.  The 6 issues presented in this volume are actually entitled \\"Ragnarok\\" parts 1-6.  In Norse Mythology, Ragnarok is the End of days, the final doomsday event.  With a title like that its pretty clear what's going to happen.   <br /> <br />Michael Avon Oeming manages to wipe out the entire Thor universe in the space of 6 issues, and while I'm not completely adverse to a grand finale, when it's written and drawn so badly it comes off as massive anti-climax.  For a start the pacing is horrible, some sections fly by so quickly you barely have a chance to figure out what's happened (Lokis attack in the first issue), whilst other sections trundle along with seemingly nothing actually happening (Thor bumbling around trying to figure out why the Odinforce left him).  It doesn't help that the character of Thor has never been so badly written; he acts at times like a spoiled child, and at other times like a moaning old geezer.  Never once do we get the sense of proud God-hood that writers like Simonson and (to an extent) Jurgens captured. <br /> <br />Oemings story relies on the shock value of killing off the Thor cast one by one.  If that's the only way he can make his stories exciting, then I hope he never gets given free reign over the rest of the Marvel Universe.   <br /> <br />Now onto the art - It's quite clear that Andrea DeVito is not yet capable of inking his own pencils.  Take away the fancy colouring that so many artists hide behind these days and your left with some pretty bland art.  There's nothing wrong with the actual layouts, but his inks over them are awfully bland and flat.  Good inking is supposed to add depth form and texture, whereas DeVitos inks appear tosimple trace his pencil art.  Get this man a decent inker! <br /> <br />So, this is how the Mighty Thor ends?  Not with a bang but with a whimper.  Buy the Walt Simonson Thor Trade paperbacks instead of wasting your money on this pathetic attempt.	2005-10-12

They have been together all of their lives and this summer would be the first summer that they would spend apart. Lena was going to Greece, Bridget was going to a soccer camp in California, Carmen was going to visit her dad in South Carolina, and Tibby was staying home. This novel shows the true meaning a friendship. <br /> <br />This book is very easy to read and understand. The way Brashares connects each of the girls makes the book even better. Each girl has a different story to tell. The novel isn't focused on just one of the girls. It's like the reader is actually reading four different books that are tied together. All of the things the girls go through are things that people can relate to. This connects the reader with the novel. Bridget lost her mother and is raised by her father. Carmen's parents are divorced and her father is getting remarried. Lena is learning about her grandparents who live in Greece. Tibby is stuck at home while all of her friends are out of town. The stories of each girl are told through their eyes so you understand where they are coming from and how they feel. Sometimes their friends comment on things so the reader gets more than just one persons point of view. At the end of their journey they all learn an important lesson. Brashares took four different stories and combined them into one novel, making it different from other types of novels.    <br />	2005-10-12

Wills does a wonderful job of context and fleshing out the personalities that Adams makes reference to.<br /><br />The two personalities, Jefferson and John Adams are quite fascinating. Henry Adams takes a position that Jeffersonians have for years misunderstood. His book is not so much a criticism of Jefferson (although some of Jefferson's notions, such as conquering Canada using the Virginia militia need criticism) as it is an analysis of the ironies of his administration.<br /><br />Anyone wishing to make sense of the USA now needs to understand the events of 1800-1808 and how they led to so many things we now take for granted.<br /><br />Wills' book is great reading and sheds some very valuable light on Henry Adams' personality and motivations.

He discusses several classes of investments from index funds, cash equivalents, common stocks, fixed income, real estate, venture capital, market-neutral (hedge) funds, and several others.  You're not going to learn how to start your own fund, but you will get an idea of how to diversify an institutional portfolio among various investment classes.  You'll get some insight into the  politics involved in institutional investment (e.g. dealing w/ investment committes), investment manager tracking strategies (to properly evaluate your portfolio), and long-term investing (coming to terms w/ the fact that you're not going to beat the S&P every year).  Mr. Olson also speaks about pension payouts and a few things to consider from that perspective (like insurance, bulk payments, etc.).  Highly recommended for beginners or intermediates (as an overview) in this area.	2005-10-12

I was surprised because I found the book about Thomas and Marrianne a bit trite and rather silly. This however was a deeply moving love story. And those of you that felt Jocelyn shallow and annoyingly just another pretty face - well she only was that in about the first chapter. I expected her to be all of that and more after reading about her in the other book. However,considering what happened to her - all of a sudden having to marry someone she did not know at all - and being forced to give up all of her girlhood dreams (no matter if they were silly and superficial) I thought she was quite a good sport about it from almost the first day of the marriage. She could have truly been a pain in the neck for Rand. Acutally more often than not people that are forced to marry in situations like this one or the other continues to be a pain to the other for a very long time. I loved how they decided to take it one step at a time and recognized very quickly that neither was quite as bad as they had thought. Certainly Rand was a handsome gentleman with lots of great qualities. Mostly he was kindly, funny and seemed willing to not assume Jocelyn was only a shallow pretty merinary. These two actually got to know one another and it was very romantic. I love the billard game. All in all this was a grand and glorious love story and I was more than pleased!	2005-10-12

This book was a complete waste of my time and money, except that it really did solve my insomnia a few times (and I'm serious--I fell asleep EVERY TIME I tried to read it).<br /><br />Book One was good despite the long, ponderous history lessons and techno/military exposition. Honor and her fellow characters were interesting and the action was intense.<br /><br />Book Two was amazing, a great read without the flaws of the first book. I was surprised to get so emotionally involved, and some of the climactic scenes are among the finest I've ever read in science fiction.

It's easy to dismiss her allegations of childhood abuse as False Memory Syndrome, but two points argue against this:  (1) she recovered her memories spontaneously before she ever saw a therapist, and (2) she has medical evidence to corroborate them.  (It's interesting that, although her ex-husband has challenged her memory of some events -- which isn't surprising, as they happened over a dozen years ago, and, given how their paths have diverged, it's likelier that he remembers the positive parts and she the negative -- he doesn't deny that she was abused.) <br /> <br />As for her comments on the Mormon Church, I know a number of former Mormons, and, based on their recollections as well as hers, I've concluded that it really *is* that weird.  Most major world religions today are huge, elaborate edifices of dogma, ceremonial, and bureaucracy that bear about as much relationship to their founder's original vision as (say) St. Peter's bears to a stable in Bethlehem;  but the original vision was something simple,  straightforward, and resonant.  By contrast, the Mormon faith is based on the writings of a single founder who, it's apparent, simply made up most of it.  On this shaky foundation, the Mormons built not only a religion but a considerable financial and political structure.  So it's hardly surprising that, when one of the cornerstones (The Pearl of Great Price) is proven to be made of thin air, the thought control police swing into action lest the whole structure begin to totter.  This book well expresses the painful dilemma of devout Mormons who are torn between the demands of their church (with all the family and personal obligations it involves) and their knowledge that there are holes in the foundations, so I feel that it's valuable reading for that reason alone.	2005-10-12

Anyway, this book was NOT prepared by Leschetizky himself. To be exact, neither was it prepared for the pedagogue's students; rather, it was prepared for those students who were not yet ready for lessons by the pedagogue himself.     It is more a method as remembered by one of his particular pupils --the pedagogue taught according to the individual need of his pupil-- who later also became one of his mistresses and assistants, to be applied to those intermediates under her only.     Few of this padagogue's great pupils, in any, had gone through such \\"method\\" , for most of them were child prodigies themselves. The pedagogue's real method instead concentrated on phrasing, interpretation and musicality and his ability to explore and draw from the potentials of these already great pupils-- as explained by his pupils like Moiseiwitsch and Horszowski.     There are however some pictures of hand positions and some finger excercises that are of some value. There are dozens of them showing the \\"correct\\" hand positions for various chords etc (without much elaboration on what effects such hand positions could achieve), presumably they were Lechetizsky's hands. Note that, however, not even Moiseiwitsch played with such curved fingers and that even one of his most favoured pupils Horszowski -- whom he presented as the Mozart of the day, just like he hailed Schnabel as Schubert-- who followed him for 6 years, changed the weight of his arms and hand position in the middle of his career!    For an alternative, we can listen directly to his pupils, particularly Ignaz Friedman who later became his assistant, someone the pedagogue himself observed to be technically better than himself. Or even Moiseiwitsch and Horszowski, or perhaps Paderewski. For those who are really interesteed, we still have some fine historic recording of the padagogue on the piano avaiblable which could tell us more than any words by one of his many so-called assistants!	2005-10-12

The author recounts ad nauseum her daily routine involving visits to her sick daughter and meetings with doctors, with very little insight into the depth of her feelings or the tragedy of loss. I am shocked that this book is receiving such fabulous reviews, and it makes me lose faith in the whole publishing/review process.  I recently suffered a devastating loss and have the greatest sympathy for Ms. Didion.  I had hoped that this book might provide some insight and relief for me, but only became more frustrated that the author provided little history of her relationship with her husband and daughter and their early life together, and she only speaks of grief in vague terms of her confusion and disorientation. This book is not enlightening or eloquent or cohesive in any way, and is hardly the benchmark for those who grieve.	2005-10-12

It came yesterday and I was up late last night finishing it. It is a mixture of history and legend about how a community of persecuted Jews in Turkey, more than a millennia ago packed up and moved to Kaifeng, China, the ancient capital in Henan province, because it had a reputation for being very tolerant. Amazingly, this community manages to survive in isolation up until the early 20th century even though they take on Chinese names, win converts, and eventually become ethnically Chinese. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there is no photo of this book. The illustrations are wonderful. It is a large thin book divided into 20 enhanced historical stories, fairly easy reading about 140 pages. My only complaints/suggestions are that there are no maps detailing the exodus from Turkey and their routes and stops along the Silk Roads. I lived in China for a year and am a bit more familiar with some of the things brought up in the story than the average American; however, I think Xu Xin and Betty Friend should have elaborated on some cultural and historical aspects, maybe provide some worldwide time tables. Also I and my Chinese friends would have enjoyed seeing the actual Chinese characters for many of the Chinese terms. To those unfamiliar, Chinese is a tonal language with a zillion homonyms. Story 14 was a bit confusing and the authors mix the pinyin, alphabetical system, with the older Wade-Giles system when naming some provinces.I would like to get in touch with Xu Xin but unfortunately, there is no website or e-mail provided.	2005-10-12

(This is harder than you would think)    <br /> <br />2)  Write down your desires, envision them, review them often, think about them often  <br /> <br />3)  Focus on the joy of having your heart's desire instead of the distress of not having it or jealousy if someone else has what you desire.   Be open and receptive to blessings.  EXPECT and believe that you will get what you desire.  Let the Universe handle the details.  In time,  the law of attraction will manifest the people and situations necessary for you to achieve/acquire the things that you desire.     The details of the manifestation process may not be exactly as envisioned, but the end result will be the same.  <br /> <br />4)  As you go about your life,  experiencing different things, your desires may change.   That's okay.  Revise your list and focus on your new desires. <br /> <br />  <br />I've only tried this process on worthy goals (ie.. more time to spend with my family,  spiritual growth,  more information on a particular subject).  I don't desire to win the lottery or get rich.    However,  my experience has been that this process does deliver and it is certainly fun.	2005-10-12

This book is similar to the \\"SAT Math with TI\\" with three important additions. The first addition is a chapter on TI 89. In this chapter the author explains the F2 (algebra) menu of TI 89 which I believe is very useful for a college bound student. The second addition is 10 original 1C - 2C tests. Traditionally the tests are harder than usual. The third addition is the fact that there are more solved examples. I definitely recommend this book for all in search of a book devoted to the usage of TI in high school math context.	2005-10-12

Kelton found the formula earlier in \\"The Time It Never Rained\\" and \\"The Time The Cowboys Quit\\" and improved on it even more for this novel.  I've always been fascinated about the arrival of the automobile in the early West.  Everyone didn't one morning wake up and say, \\"Let's go buy a car\\".  So the transition yields rich opportunities for story development.  Like J. Frank Dobie, Kelton grew up on a ranch and heard many of the old-timers sharing tales of a life long since gone.  In this book they're woven into a believable tapestry of hard life in an unforgiving landscape.  Kelton does a wonderful job of putting Hewey Calloway in both the past and the present...and what's so believable is that this character sees both as well as the challenges of the future.  He just hates to see it come.  As the years go on these books will continue to rise to the top as evidence that Westerns are more than shoot-em ups.  They are documentaries on a way of life that set standards, which this Country will seldom see again.  Kelton says this book nearly wrote itself.  Thankfully, he was there to show it the way.	2005-10-12

Ms Barstow writes well and with a nice fluent style that makes history readable rather than `dusty' or `dry'. There is no doubt she paints a vivid picture of the witch craze in early modern Europe and there are references that point to further reading for those who are interested.<br />However the author writes from an extremely feminist viewpoint which I found a little overpowering (and I class myself as a feminist). Her prologue focuses on violence against women in modern society and uses that as a comparison for what happened in the witch hunt. There is scant attention paid to the fact that 20% of those accused of witchcraft were men, a significant number. Indeed, in Eastern Europe there were more men accused than women.<br />Whilst there is no doubt that some misogyny came into play during that time, and that there were awful consequences for women accused of being witches, I would have liked a more balanced view of the witch-hunt rather than one that assumed all judges, witch finders and jailers were sexually abusive toward the (female) accused. The author particularly criticises the notoriously misogynystic `Malleus Maleficarum' whilst seemingly oblivious to the fact she is as guilty of sexism as the authors of that book were.<br />Ms Barstow does refer to the work of many eminent historians who have written on this topic, but seems to find fault in all of their findings, giving the impression that she is the only one with a `realistic' view of what the witch-hunt was about. This is quite a useful book for the undergraduate studying this period, so long as they balance it with plenty of other reading matter rather than taking this as a definitive text.	2005-10-12

The protagonist, Matteo, is male, but the story is universal and not to be missed by any literature fan.  This is one of those books that can change a middle schooler from a non-reader to a reader.<br /><br />The story unfolds gradually, as we learn about Matt and his life as a clone, a second-class citizen, growing up in the sprawling mansion of rich and powerful feudal drug lord El Patron, the man from whose DNA Matt was cloned.  Matt is unsure of his place in the world, and he needs to learn about the inner workings of the household and its members, the robot-like people who farm opium, the politics of the land El Patron rules between the US and Mexico, as well as Matt's own purpose in life (why did El Patron make a clone?  Is Matt his ultimate heir or is there a darker purpose?).  The reader is along for Matt's journey of self-discovery, as he figures out who to trust and where the real truth lies.  Along the way, Matt finds love as well as boyhood friendship and bonding.<br /><br />There's an important lesson in here about the fate of those who grow up inside cults:  When Matt figures out what is right and wrong in the world, will he be able to make the right choice and reject the powerful but evil man who brought him into this world?  What if your hero is a kind man to you, but reviled by the rest of the world?<br /><br />Another interesting aspect of the story is the way the future echoes the past.  In the futuristic world of House of the Scorpion, some places have reverted to the dark ages, with feudal lords ruling over people who can do nothing but farm the land.  Students of history will have an interesting time contrasting the future portrayed in this book with the \\"evils\\" of the past.<br /><br />The epic story of Matt's childhood, personal growth, and his final destiny makes for great reading.  This is highly recommended to readers of all ages.  My one complaint is that it starts a little slow, and the majority of the action is packed into the second half, so if you are having trouble getting into this book, I implore you to charge on, because the journey is very worthwhile.

Information about adults with AS is just appearing on the market. This is one such book. Written by college students with AS, each essay contributes a unique understanding of what it means to enter adulthood with AS.  <br /> <br />The editor, Dawn Prince-Hughes, consciously maintained the intergrity of each writer's unique style. At times the use of train of thought might be a little tricky for a neurotypical person to follow. But this is a lesson in and of itself: The person with AS has a different perspective of the world and we need to learn to embrace those differences.  <br /> <br />Any parent with a teen with AS and any teen/college student with AS should read these first hand accounts of the lives of real people with real issues.	2005-10-12

A good and a bad aspect of this book is the straight to the point with no extra information style Philip Pullman uses. This makes the book great for readers of all levels but also it makes the book seem a little rushed at times. This adaptation or more appropriately  addition to the fairy tale of Cinderella was defiantly a quick read but for the most part the book was alright.

It explains the sacrament of Confession pretty well and has some guidelines in the appendix for the sacrament and an examination of conscience. Ultimately, this book is meant to be useful in helping people with Confession, both in understanding why they need it and in helping them with the actual sacrament. <br /> <br />I really liked his explanation of Confession as seen in the Genesis stories, especially with Adam and Eve and Cain. I would never have looked at those stories in that way... that God gives them the opportunity to confess what they've done wrong and, like humans tend to do, they avoid doing that. <br /> <br />He breaks down the whole thing pretty well, talking about where (historically/biblically) we get the sacrament, why we need the sacrament, and, most importantly I think, how receiving the sacrament is supposed to have an effect on our life (i.e., how Confession isn't just a free pass to sin again, but we should be trying our best to avoid that sin in the future). <br /> <br />Two things did annoy me though.  First, Hahn tries to be all cute with his chapter titles and headings within the chapter. A couple of them were so bad that they made me want to be sick (e.g., \\"When I Am Weekly, Then I Am Strong\\").  The other thing that really bothered me is that Scott Hahn is (I believe) an Evangelical convert to Catholicism and perhaps it's because of that that he's really negative about anything Protestant. He discusses in one chapter how C.S. Lewis went to Confession and he calls Lewis a \\"Protestant apologist\\". Lewis would roll over in his grave if he knew that he was described that way because his whole thing was that he wanted to be \\"merely\\" Christian. <br /> <br />All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone who feels weird about going to Confession (like me!) because it explain things in such a way that you end up thinking that you will be able to do it, even if you've avoided it in the past.	2005-10-12

We learn of the Native American reliance upon the great bison...and that without the use of bison as a food resource, the West might never had been won.

So in view of the unblemished string of five-star reviews, cut me some slack if I tell you that \\"Falls the Shadow\\" is not up to the Lashner standards we've come to expect.<br /><br />This is by no means a bad novel.  Many of the strengths of earlier Lashner - the gritty Philadelphia neighborhoods, characters with more depth than the average cardboard cutout, storylines running from the unusual to the bizarre - are all here.  Told in the first person, the story unfolds as easily as if Carl were telling it to the reader over a brew at a Philly watering hole.  But this time around, the story feels tired, forced, lacking energy as Victor Carl grinds through familiar haunts feeling like one of \\"The Hollow Men\\" of the TS Elliot-referenced title.<br /><br />We find Carl and partner Beth Derringer taking on the case of Francois Dube, already serving time for the murder of his wife.  Dube, an insufferable French chef, maintains his innocence and, with financial backing from the equally obnoxious gold digger Velma Takahashi, convinces Carl, against all odds, to pursue a retrial.  True to Lashner's offbeat form, a meddling dentist, \\"Bob\\", plays a key role in the mystery of the Dube murder, as well as in a side plot involving a reluctant Carl's role in a pro bono case of child neglect.  Maybe it's the combination of annoying Frenchmen and of uncomfortable time in a dentist's chair. Or maybe it's the absence of the brutal color typically provided by Carl heavy Phil Skink, or the unnecessary tension between Carl and Beth.  Perhaps it's the rather contrived climax, or the confluence of too many players with too many stories trying too hard to deliver too many morals. But whatever the source, when all the drama has finally played out and the enigma that is Dr. Bob is unraveled,  \\"Falls the Shadow\\" simply misses the mark.  A better-than-average legal thriller, for sure, but one that ultimately fails to generate passion, falling short of Lashner's uncommon talents.finally played out and the enigma that is Dr. Bob is unraveled,  \\"Falls the Shadow\\" simply misses the mark.

My dad bought a Polaroid Land Camera (of the peel-apart type) before I was born... to take pictures of his chubby firstborn (that would be me, BTW).  <br /> <br />Ever since, the sharp, colorful and amazingly stable little prints became part of our family's memory. My love for pictures was definitely boosted by the instant gratification offered by an SX-70 camera, which I still own and use after 25+ years, as well as a brand new Jobpro 600.  <br /> <br />\\"The Polaroid Book\\" is a must for any hardcore Polaroid fan. Lotsa pictures, beautifully printed, with absolute respect for the authors' vision (Ansel Adams, Joyce Tenneson and Bill Allard, to mention only three of them). Nevertheless, the book's greatest virtue is to prove, without any doubt, that beautiful and creative work can be achieved with the simplest tools and the sheer power of imagination. <br /> <br />Polaroid is still alive and well, and this book is the best supporting evidence. Now, I'll just lay back and wait for that new new-old stock Polaroid Nightcam that I bought on the company's website.

After the moonlight moment between Yuki and Tohru they head back to the Sohma home together. The next day Akito summons for Haru to pay him a visit, while Tohru and Kyo head to the beach to make sand castles. Yuki and Momitchi meets up with them and Yuki is tender with Tohru again. Akito and Kureno head to the Sohma house to meet with Tohru, a woman whom Akito despises. They find their way to the beach, where he sees Kyo and Tohru having fun and being happy, and it unnerves him so much he decides to prolong the visit. On the way home Tohru encounters a horse on the ground. This turns out to be Isuzu Sohma, another member of the zodiac. She turns back to her female form and warns Tohru and Yuki not to tell anyone she was there and runs off half naked.<br /><br />Akito has demanded that Kyo be brought to him. Tohru thinks this is a good sign, though Kyo knows it cannot be. Yuki warns him not to lose his temper in front of Akito, but this proves futile as Akito brings up some painful memories, including a bet he and Kyo have that will ultimately seal Kyo's doom if he loses.  Kyo reveals to Akito  just how much Tohru means to him. Akito becomes enraged over the revelations of Kyo's heart, which he attempts to deny. He leaves Akito to go see her, and tries to pretend nothing bad happened.<br /><br />The Sohmas decide to end their vacation with a bang...literally, by blowing off an obscene amount of fireworks at Momitchi's suggestion. Akito makes an appearance in the middle of the night at the house and demands to see Tohru. Momitchi bars his way, and gets hurt in the process.

US	12091733	R39YWI2ZHY82XU	1413783376	346430962	Human Interface	Books	4	11	12	N	N	Hold on just a minute	(Spoiler Alert)  <br />   Having read this book two months or so back, I actually reread the book based on the review below and I must say that calling this novel a direct rip of the Matrix is entirely misleading. Where this book shines is within the premise that a free thinking computer wouldn't \\"exist\\" in the typical definition of the term.  The author goes into great detail about how the computer's first line of defense would be to encrypt its operating directives and spread them across the digital network of earth, meaning a shut down would be completely impossible without wiping out every piece of electronic equipment on the planet (& orbiting it for that matter). <br />As a student at RIT, we were actually recommended the reading due to the implications of advanced algorithm writing when used to duplicate decision making, there are endless debates as to what qualifies as true intelligence versus scripted decision making. <br />   What interested me most, however, is the speculative nanotechnology usage within: transmitters and receivers on such a minute level that, when injected into the body, could capture and relay electrical impulses within the brain, in essence making the human body compatible with the machine.  These are just some of the concepts that will be presented in Human Interface, but they are backed with scientific explanations that as I stated above, have even gotten professors of technology debating. <br />   It is too short for my liking, but there are no stones left unturned, and as I have found on some message boards, the ending has two interpretations that can actually change the entire way the story is viewed. <br />   Either Mr. Dodds: 1) Has got a personal vendetta with Publish America, 2) Never saw the Matrix, or 3) Skipped the essential concepts of this book so that he could boast finishing it in 2 hours because what I and the rest of my class read is not at all what he describes in his critique.	2005-10-12

No matter what direction I opine, my words will likely end up sandwiched in between positive and negative reviews. Every single book on this site receives the exact same treatment, too. Some people love a book, some don't. That's the way the cookie crumbles. If you take one look over the reviews on this page, you will see my point. Positive reviews clashing with negative reviews from people who can't even spell. I mean, if you're gonna have the nerve to come on a website and slam someone's work, the least you could do is learn how to spell the word \\"influential\\" properly. It's with a \\"t\\", not a \\"c,\\" ok? Is it any wonder that guy's girl can't get past the first page? That strange language and style the book is written in is called \\"ENGLISH.\\" I guess ignorance is an air-borne disease after all, huh? Three words for you and your gal: \\"Hooked On Phonics\\". <br /> <br />Getting to the point now. As one of many VH fans who purchased this when it came out last month, I highly recommend it. It is a terrific, all-encompassing, educational read. The most shocking part is that according to rumors going around online, it was written by a fan. If that is the case, I should hope every band will have a fan like this one. Four stars from me.	2005-10-12

I bought this book because I wanted to make delicious meals for my new hubby.  I didn't know how to cook alot of things, but I know my way around the kitchen.  I was very disappointed that out of 15 or so recipes, none had much taste.  Maybe I am biased because I am from Texas and we like our food spicy - or at least flavorful - but I thought everything was too bland.<br /><br />Instead I recommend \\"The Ultimate Southern Living Cookbook\\".  It does not claim to have nearly as many recipes, but the recipes it does have are flavorful and easy enough that novice chefs like myself can make a meal you'd be proud to serve to company or your beloved.<br /><br />Oh, in Bittman's credit, I think his recipes from his TV show are much better, probably because he is competing with world class chefs who inspire creativity and flavor.	2005-10-12

I took my children to Dr. Denmark at the same time I was using an Emory (Atlanta) Pediatric Practice.  Dr. Denmark saw an undetected and undiagnosed anaemic 4 month old who could not gain weight or stay well.  I put together the super-iron filled cooked/blended chicken livers with formula per her suggestion and in two weeks never looked at a milky faced child again.  We called my daughter GI-Jane in the next few years.  Per Dr. Denmark, my babies were on 4 hour sleeping schedules right away, ate well, slept great and were sick much less than Traditionally Peded Babies. <br />She also has a really corny way of telling you straight that you better keep yourself up for your husband.  He will have nice looking women at work, and you better keep your house, kids and yourself looking good for your husband.  This has always served us well.   <br />She has always ached for kids whose parents drink, smoke, and are overstressed.  It sounds like preaching, but the greatest thing you can do for a child is give them calm parents and a calm home.  Before the extended release antibiotics, Dr. Denmark had us giving a dose of antibiotics in the middle of the night (72 hour)to keep infection on the run.  This always broke the infection sooner and the child was not as run down from the overingestion of anibiotics.  She sees mothers as the first nurse that sees the child.  We are trusted but always instructed.  She is pro-protien and sans sugary drinks.  It is the science of good nutrition. <br />The psychology that I love for child raising is to tell a child, \\"Let's\\" clean up...not go clean up.\\"  It's all good for me.  She is a saint and a scientist. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Camille Christopher <br /> <br />.	2005-10-12

The book reminded me of those movies we've all gone to see because the idea behind the movie is intriguing, but the delivery leaves a lot to be desired.  So the travelers can go to other realms...so what?  One realm that was intricately described was the realm of the hungry ghosts.  Gabriel goes there and finds people in a grocery store purchasing empty boxes of processed food items.  Sorry, but this doesn't really sound like a realm that's all too different than the one we're all living in right now.  Oh...am I on to something?  In any case, the author failed to create a PURPOSE to his idea, other than \\"THE MAN\\" trying to control everyone...not too original. So far, travelers just go around encouraging people to start hippie communes where no one fights, cheats on their spouse, or commits crime.  Yeah, that's believable.  Humans have been in turmoil with each other in all written history, not just since the days of CNN.  John Fourty-Five Eagles better do a better job with his next two installments if he doesn't want to become a laughing stock. And since I've already discovered a colossal waste of time in the form of this book, I won't be reading them.

The primary academic division at the beginning level of economics is the Micro/Macro-economic divide; often it is taught as a two-semester sequence for students going into economics, political science, history, business or any other such discipline that requires a thorough grounding in economic theory and principles.<br /><br />Bade and Parkin are aware from decades of teaching experience that students often get lost in a sea of detail, and that many introductory economics texts (as do the introductory texts of many fields) attempt to do too much too quickly in introducing their subjects. Bade and Parkin organise each chapter, therefore, around only a few core principles - three or four at most. They have also built into this text a very extensive set of charts and diagrams to demonstrate the points that are being explained in the text.<br /><br />Each chapter begins with a checklist, and ends with checkpoints (which follow on from section checkpoints along the way). Included in this is a featured called the 'Eye on...' feature - these are small articles that highlight practical, real life situations in which the principles under discussion apply. They may be domestic or international in scope, and may be current or significant in history.<br /><br />The book is adaptable to many different uses - the introductory pages highlight four alternative means of focus that the book can take: a traditional micro-economics course approach; a public policy emphasis; a business emphasis; or a shorter policy emphasis. Each of these build on core principles in the early chapters, and then expand from there depending upon the primary interests of the class or reader.<br /><br />The layout of the book is visually interesting and lively. The use of colour, photographs, and charts and graphs adds tremendously to the feel of the text. The text is sharp and concise, without sacrificing clarity or content.<br /><br />One very important section that I wish would have more detail and emphasis is the appendix to chapter 1 - Making and Using Graphs. Interpreting and drawing graphs seems to be the single largest problem area for students I tutor in microeconomics, so more emphasis on this part would be appreciated, particularly as the skills given in this section carry throughout the entire book. As a primary tool, the relegation of this to an appendix sends somewhat of a mixed message of the importance of graphs. Perhaps renaming this as a chapter in its own right would help somewhat, with more detail and examples (much like in mathematics, it is in the repetition of the exercises that the students gain mastery of the concepts). Students are indeed called upon to do many exercises during the course of this text (learning by doing, rather than just through reading), but the early grounding in graphical representation is critical.t is sharp and concise, without sacrificing clarity or content.  <br /> <br />One very important section that I wish would have more detail and emphasis is the appendix to chapter 1 - Making and Using Graphs.

Decades ago, I was a new mom, and I was overwhelmed with housework. I read \\"Is there life after housework?\\" by Don Aslett, and not only was my house clean, but I had time to relax, and my friends were asking me how I did it. Then I got \\"Clutter's Last Stand\\" and started throwing things away. (I remember I had three cribs in the garage, but we had no plans of having more babies.  And what about all those grocery bags under the sink?).  I got rid of a ton of stuff, and I was able to not take in too much more stuff.  <br /> <br />Years later, I went with a family member to help clean out an elderly woman's house.  What a horror!! She had gone to the thrift stores for years, and filled bags full of clothes, then piled them on the beds and floors of her three bedrooms until you could not take one step inside the room, and the junk was piled six feet high. Also, every time she got the mail (for decades), she put it in a bag without sorting it, and put it in the bedrooms too.  Love letters and old photos were mixed with sales flyers from years ago, and everything infused with silverfish.  The bedrooms had not been used for 20 years, but the rats had chewed through the walls, and had been living in the clothes and mail all that time.  When everything was finally thrown out, it turned out that one buried bed had fallen through the rotted floor and down to the dirt. We had to throw out the floor too. And the whole time we were throwing out pooped-on, chewed-up toxic trash, family members were saying, \\"No, you can't get rid of THAT!\\" What was the point of saving all that stuff? It made the bedrooms unusable, and invited vermin and disease into the house. Plus, if she had spent that money and time on decorating instead of accumutaing junk from the thrift store, she would have had three nice, usable bedrooms. In the end, all her \\"treasures\\" desintigrated to trash and had to be burned.  When I got home, I revaluated the things I was accumualating. I want a pretty, peaceful home,not a huge trash bin.  If I am not using it, I am getting rid of it.  <br /> <br />Get Clutter's Last Stand now so your grandkids won't need pitchforks and snowshovels to clean out your bedrooms.   <br />	2005-10-12

I can only recommend it for anyone who read and believed Power vs Force so they can decide for themselves how much truth is in his form of kenisiology. Also, each needs to be warned that if they are seeking a purely spiritual book, be prepared this is book is also full of a lot of politics. <br />   I had imagined that this book would be merely lists of Dr. Hawkins' Level of Calibrations (LOC's) of people, places and things. Had it been so, perhaps I may not have questioned its content. Ironically, coming from a man who says the fastest way to reach God is to give up every positionality to God, this book is full of.........positionalities. And for someone who has supposedly let go of his ego, this book is full of it. I personally would have called this book the \\"Hawkins Pontifications\\" but perhaps \\"Truth vs Falsehood\\"  IS the most revealing title. <br />    As pointed out in other reviews, his political biases are extremely conservative. He exposes his flawed kenisiology method within his sources he uses to defend his LOC's (ie. opinions), especially glaring in the political arena. For example, page 206 he uses Bill O\\"Reilly(2005) as his source that \\"[spreading memes and their disguised hatred] is now being played by Far Left financiers of organized extremist attacks that plant spurious stories with a network of `bloggers'\\". Apparently Hawkins (I doubt Bill O'Reilly) is completely unaware how many far right blogs exist on the internet. Its this lack of balance, found throughout this book, which screams at the \\"falsehood\\" of many of his arguments. <br />    Normally I would not point out errors found in manuscripts, however Hawkins has heralded his kenisiology to catch all errors and \\"falsehoods\\" by \\"testing\\" every sentence in a book before it goes to publication. Therefore, it is glaringly obtuse that he would list (pg 32) snakes, alligators, dinosaurs, song birds and doves as PREDATORY MAMMALS and cats, family cats and dogs as GRAZERS. (He says that grazers have higher LOC's than predators but cats and dogs rated pretty high, even though cats are obligate carnivores and canines are also in the order carnivore.- Mine eat a mostly raw meaty bones diet). It seems that if you cannot resolve a carnivore having a high LOC, you resolve it by listing them as a grazer!! I bring up this LOC specifically because it is objectively and scientifically wrong, and therefore should have been easily caught, and can easily be pointed out. All other LOC's in the book are subjective and opinionated, and are so numerous the ideas/sources/biases could be debated ad nauseum.  <br />    It becomes obvious to me that all he is testing is his emotional response to any subject.  <br />    Perhaps this explains how he rates great Saints and Sages in the 700's yet his own writings in the high 900s (with the highest and Christ being 1000). It would explain how he vacillates in his opinions, er,... I mean LOC's, of many ideas- from his ratings on astrology changing from a radio program to this book, and those on Gandhi's ideas of changing politics without war in previous writings certainly changing with this book, which dismisses non violence and argues for war. Other opinions also contradict within the book itself. <br />     That this is simply emotional testing could also explain why one reviewer of Power vs Force found her friends tested strong to the thought of saccharin (maybe they thought it would help them lose weight), as compared to real kenisiolgy when held against the body would make one weak. In my own experience while testing with my husband, we can get completely different LOC's on the same subject and question depending on how we each feel about it. And although Hawkins recommends in Power vs Force to use his methods for business, I warn that this can be self delusional and may lead to bad business decisions. <br />     Kenisiology in its original physical-body-test application isnot innately flawed, in my opinion.  Hawkins' mind-thought application of it does not work/tap into the highest universal mind. (God considers Fox news to be more integritous (380) than Dan Rather(205)?And the BBC to be only 15 pts above al-Jazeera?) (Pg 113) If Hawkins does achieve consistency within his close circle of testers, I agree with another reviewer that it is very possible he is subconsciously energetically influencing those around him. Or perhaps, like some political pundits, only surrounds himself with those who agree with him. <br />    I disagree with reviewers who choose to accept his religious calibrations and not his political ones. Hawkins has presented this as the \\"Truth\\", take it or leave it. In this framework, if you question some parts, you must do the same to all calibrations. <br />    Hawkins' strength is in his experiential teachings, such as his book, \\"I\\". This is the only book of his I can now recommend, although there are many more spiritual teachings I would now put ahead of even this book. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

The story has all of the elements of a first-rate novel with high stakes. During World War Two, the allied invasion of Europe will likely fail if the German army is waiting on the French coast, so the allies construct a massive, fake army pointed toward the Pas de Calais. If it misleads the Germans, the allies can invade Normandy with hope for success. But a larger-than-life, German spy, Henry (Heinrich) Faber photographs the fraud and heads toward Scotland to contact a German submarine and carry his photos to Germany. If he succeeds, the invasion will fail. But the British MI5 detects him, and the chase is on, as Faber makes his way north, killing person after person. Can the British stop him? The outcome depends on a professor, a police officer, and a young, British woman. The climax may leave you breathless. It is a tale that you should enjoy immensely.	2005-10-12

Her anecdotes are funny, strange, heart-warming, voyeuristic, and downright delightful to read.<br /><br />Wenzel organizes her tales into a series of chapters that focus on the dating scene for bartenders, what tipping is like (and how it affects bartenders), the Cosmopolitan craze, her \\"regulars,\\" the insufferable bar theme nights, restaurant hygeine, and practical tips for entering the bartending trade (Wenzel reports that bartending school diplomas are worthless).<br /><br />Wenzel has a big chip on her shoulder about men who order frou-frou drinks.  She also claims that the popularity of the Cosmopolitan and the \\"pink drinks\\" is the downfall of a liquor-appreciating society.  And don't even get her started on those messy blended ice drinks!!<br /><br />The prose is scattered with Wenzel's instructive pet peeves, which include:  customers who beg after last call, customers who grab her for attention, foreigners who pretend they don't know American tipping customs, people who just graze on the garnishes, and more.  Wenzel is also an outspoken critic of anti-smoking regulations, claiming that people come to bars to drink, smoke, let loose, and have fun, and bartenders know what kind of lifestyle they are signing up for when they accept the job.<br /><br />Wenzel's narrative is free-flowing and loosely structured, and overall, the style works.  As a reader, I was left wondering about the resolution of Wenzel's panic attacks and how exactly she met her husband, but even with these mysteries obscured, Wenzel's memoir makes for great reading.  I wish this book had reached a wider audience, and I'm going to do everything I can to recommend it.	2005-10-12

Patton's diaries from World War II.  At times, it is an illuminating and interesting look at Patton and his views, but probably because it was edited by his wife and others after Patton's death, many interesting parts of Patton's life are glossed over or ignored.  Anyone interested in Patton's war career or World War II would find this book interesting, and any current US Army officers should read this book for many of Patton's leadership lessons. <br /> <br />The book briefly describes parts of the North Africa and Sicily campaigns, and I found it very interesting to read about Patton's meetings with the Sultan of Morocco.  Most of the rest of the North African campaign was skipped, and after a few pages about the Sicily campaign, Patton is suddenly in northern Europe as the Third Army commander.  Most of his writings about the European campaign give daily updates on the condition and position of his subordinate divisions.  Fortunately, the book is replete with maps of most of the Third Army's areas of operations - something too many military history books forget. <br /> <br />For anyone hoping to find Patton's insights and feelings about the controversial incidents during his command, you won't find them in this book.  Most events are completely skipped over: the soldier slapping incidents are mentioned in two paragraphs on page 381 of 390 pages of text; there is no mention of Patton's difficult months after being passed over to lead the American D-Day effort and while serving as the \\"diversion\\" for a second invasion; there is no mention of Patton's comments and insults about the Soviet Russians as allies; and there is nothing about Patton and his tepid de-Nazification of his sector in Germany.  Also, when criticizing many of his subordinate commanders and discussing the relief of some commanders, this book omits the names of those being criticized and only refers to them by position; and the reader has to wonder if these criticisms were whitewashed by the editors after Patton's death. <br /> <br />Despite these shortcomings, this book still gives many insights into Patton's persona not found in most other works.  Too often, Patton is portrayed as a one-dimensional commander whose success relied on the discipline of his soldiers and his obsessiveness with the attack.  Anyone reading this book will quickly discover that Patton's brilliance as a commander was based on a well-developed command philosophy.  Patton understood that his role as an Army commander was to support his corps commanders and give them the moral support necessary when they grew weary.  Patton's flamboyant personality was part of this philosophy as well: for instance, he would always drive to the frontlines when visiting the frontlines but fly back to his headquarters, because he wanted his soldiers to always see him going forward and never see him leaving the front. <br /> <br />This book should be read by all current Army officers, because many of Patton's lessons are timeless.  He had a thorough understanding of the functions of his staff, and insisted that representatives from each staff section visit frontline units daily.  The book ends two many chapters on his personal views of the Army: a chapter called \\"Earning My Pay,\\" recounting various anecdotes throughout his Army career and the lessons he learned; and \\"Reflections and Suggestions,\\" with tactical advice for soldiers and commanders. <br /> <br />This book is mostly a detailed recounting of Patton's World War II European campaign.  For the casual reader wanting to learn more about the real Patton, I recommend looking elsewhere.  But WWII buffs and real George S. Patton fans will get a lot of insight from this book, and all current U.S. Army officers should read it for the timeless lessons that Patton teaches.	2005-10-12

As the authors point out, the original meaning of angel is messenger. The individual true accounts that follow from a variety of writers show that dogs do indeed, have special messages for us, not the least of which is unconditional love and devotion.  The authors' introduction touches briefly on the unique relationship between dogs and humans dating back to the Stone Age. It is followed by individual accounts of dogs who played a special role sometimes heroic, sometimes healing, and sometimes just being there in response to the emotional need of a member of their family.  <br />It makes you wonder what early humans did to inspire such steadfast devotion from another species.	2005-10-12

The guide wasn't EXACTLY what I had hoped for. I usually obsess over guides, wanting a HUGE guide with extremely detailed points and tips. But, it got the job done. <br /> <br />There are a few errors and a few things I wasn't especially happy with. The inventory for the weapon arms such as the Vampire and the gun, Ziege Rifle were missing. I really wished they were in there. <br /> <br />The strategies were very good, it showed the easiest way to defeat your enemies since Front Mission 4 is more strategy then overpower your enemies. <br /> <br />The best part is at the end, just before the simulators, that they show you step by step how to get the bonus weapons. They also cited how to do so on each page and marked it so you'd remember. However, such as getting the Vampire arms, they didn't specifically tell you you had to do Simulator 10, which all they really did was hint at it. <br /> <br />The simulator strategies were good, although it would have been better if they were more detailed. Unfortunately, they didn't list what your rewards for each simulator was after you defeat it such as the money and prize, which kinda bugged me. <br /> <br />All in all, however, this strategy guide is a good one. It WILL help you beat the game very quickly. The first time I played Front Mission 4, it took me over 100 hours, mostly cuz I like to train and destroy my enemies instead of just beat them. So far, I'm at the end in less than 5 hours, with the guide. <br /> <br />So, if you like Front Mission 4, and you want to taste the power of all the bonuses, buy this guide.	2005-10-12

Confessions of a Street Addict really brings to light the career of James Cramer starting off as a struggling writer to successful hedge fund manager.<br /><br />I liked how Cramer didn't focus on just his success.  I really liked the beginning of the book that clearly showed Cramer's interest in the market, talking about the market and struggling as a writer in southern California.  Cramer's story is inspiring and not sugar coated.  As he eventually finds his way, he is offerred a more lucrative career path in New York and that eventually leads him to his stock market business where he meets his wife.<br /><br />I liked how Cramer talked about how rough it was trying to get started in the business, how to succeed and how crule the reality of it was.  Cramer doesn't wave any flags for Wall Street and doesn't make it sound like it's an easy, forgiving world out there.  Cramer's story about his sruggles with TheStreet.com, his hedge fund, managing people, family and the roar of trading in the 90's really comes to life in this book.<br /><br />I recommend this book because Cramer tells it like it is.  He doesn't praise himself, he doesn't sugar coat and it was very intriguing reading.	2005-10-12

The evidence presented is complex, involving literary sources, geology, and archaeology, but a critical portion of the author's argument is whether in Homeric times this western peninsula was separated from Cephalonia by a sea channel since closed up by earthquake-induced rockfalls.<br /><br />Although Bittlestone is \\"only\\" an enthusiastic amateur, his research has been reviewed and backed by his professional co-authors, one a professor of Greek and Latin and the other a geologist specializing in the Ionian island area.<br /><br />I find Bittlesone's analysis to be persuasive, but as yet -- and he recognizes this -- the evidence is not wholly conclusive.  This may come in the next several years with additional geological work to confirm the existence of the sea channel and with archaeological surveys to study various associated sites.	2005-10-12

This one also provided more info on the \\"lesser\\" vampires. Liu was occasionally too heavy on the classism, racism, and other such issues. While the mallet was soft rubber, the reader was still hit over the head with it. Nevertheless, the book was a very good read, engrossing and pleasing.

There is so much division in the church already, of which is pointed out well in the book.  However, as a Christian who attends a Lutheran Church I KNOW our Pastors would NOT be sitting on the fence as described in this book.  Yes, it's just fiction, but such writing is typical from this \\"stripe\\" of Chirstianity of which I have once been a part.  If you are Lutheran, Catholic, Espicopal, Presp.you aren't really a Christian or your lukewarm at best.  I used to think that way and now it makes me sick.  I started reading this book thinking it was going to go in another direction and I was so dissapointed to see the typical sterotyping...it's almost not genuine to followers of Christ.<br /><br />The book also gets bogged down in far too many details of his past.  You start to find yourself wanting the author to get ot the point.<br /><br />For this reason I am NOT recommending this book as a must read, as I normally would for Peretti.

Part four of five, then...<br /><br />Whilst this sort of book, a run through of the Marvel Universe, would have been essential 10 years ago, with the onslaught of the internet it seems a little pointless. Yeah, it's always nice to have these things actually in your hand, but there are countless internet sites that have all this information, and those are updated, with new pics and facts and histories... another nail in the coffin for the humble book, I'm afraid.<br /><br />But I'm not here to actually talk about THIS book per se. I'm here to talk about Marvel in particular, and why it's one of the five things that makes The Curmudgeon's world go round. I'd like to think of myself as a big comic book fan, but in reality I haven't even scratched the surface of a lot of work and titles out there. I suppose it's a bit like a Pop Idol fan - fairly ignorant except for what's put in front of them. Hell, I'd like to read more comics from outside the \\"mainstream\\", as it were, but it's all about the Benjamins, baby. I just can't afford it. Anyone wants to recommend a title The Curmudgeon really SHOULD take a look at, drop me a line.<br /><br />Saying that, I think I'm pretty well versed on the Marvel Universe. And what a Universe it is; these characters are so rich, so varied and nowadays have such brilliant writers its impossible not to get sucked into it all. When you read just some of the genre defining characters that the likes of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created, it boggles the mind..<br /><br />The Hulk, Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Punisher, Daredevil, Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Howard The Duck..<br /><br />Ahem. Well, maybe not the last one. But seriously, the stories in the Marvel comics have given me so much enjoyment over the years its hard to put into words. DC are OK, and have a fair share of great characters (arguably more famous than Marvel's) but they lack the depth and style that Marvel have (really though, how BORING is Superman?)<br /><br />As a side note, anyone wanting to maybe introduce themselves to the Marvel Universe but find themselves a bit swamped with all the history etc, try the Ultimate Marvel comics (especially Spider-Man).

I have a longstanding interest in what might be called \\"domestic social history\\" of the 19th century -- how American and British households operated, what they ate and how, what were considered good manners, clothing customs, the functioning of the \\"servant class,\\" and all of that. The author of this excellent work is Curator of Household Accessories and Tablewares at the Strong Museum in Rochester, one of the leading Victoriana museums in this country, and she certainly knows her subject. Per the title, she concentrates on the kitchen and dining room (with short excursions into the garden for tea and into city restaurants for special occasions), explaining where customs like placemats originated, detailing the astonishing amount of china and silverware thought necessary in a proper middle-class home, and analyzing the evolution of table manners over a period of three generations. Period illustrations are plentiful, as are quotations from 19th century sources (the bibliography runs to six pages) and menus from the social pages of the newspapers. There's also a lengthy collection of recipes of the time. If you want to pick up on what William Dean Howells was really talking about, read this book.	2005-10-12

Weiner's writing style and wit were on the mark. But I felt that the characters were one-dimensional, not very sympathetic, and in ways not even likable. There was so much focus on the negative of early motherhood that you never got the sense there was any joy as well. This is especially true of how the husbands are portrayed. <br /> <br />I also felt that some of the plotlines were not plausible. Why would these three girls suddenly become so close so quickly just because they took a yoga class together? Also, if a woman loses her child, would she really find solace in OTHER people's children? Not only does it seem creepy that she comes across as a bit of a stalker, but I just don't buy that this is how a woman deals with this kind of pain. <br /> <br />Eventually the story started to drag. I began to care less and less what happened to these glum women, just the opposite of how I felt about Maggie and Rose Feller of In Her Shoes.	2005-10-12

Before I read this book, all I really knew about the Supreme Court was that it was  powerful, and that appointments to the Court were for life.  After reading this outstanding book by a true Constitutional scholar, I have a much better appreciation of the Court's role and I understand why there is so much Congressional interest in and political rhetoric about President Bush's two recent Supreme Court nominations.   <br /> <br />Levin made extensive use of our Founding Fathers' historical documents to analyze the Court's actions and decisions.  The main purpose of his analysis was to show the ideological differences between conservative judicial originalists (judges who \\"look to the text of the Constitution and the intent of the framers when deciding a constitutional question\\") and liberal judicial activists (judges who \\"consider the Constitution a document of broad principles and concepts, one that empowers them to substitute their personal beliefs, values, and policies for those enumerated in the Constitution\\").  Levin is a staunch judicial originalist who sees judicial activists as a serious threat to our freedoms.   <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Levin presented a strong case with many examples to support his position that the tyrannical Court has assumed authority not granted to it, and has usurped authority granted to Congress, the President, and the states.  His examples were very effective, especially when he quoted from actual Court opinions and decisions.  I often had to read those Court quotes more than once (or twice) to try and understand their logic.  Levin's analysis and commentary leading up to and following the quotes really helped me to understand the significance of those Court opinions and decisions. <br /> <br />Levin's well-documented depiction of a Supreme Court out-of-control and out-of-touch with our Nation's core beliefs and governmental principles should be a wake-up call for all Americans.    <br />	2005-10-12

The book is a major disappointment in that regard and I do not recommend it to anyone but a novice and perhaps those not yet familiar with the upper Texas coast.	2005-10-12

It surprised me though, thatI indeed enjoyed it, because of the title being so very similar to Tolkien's Aragon. I thought, probably like many, what kind of cheesy foolish repeat or 'Ode to Tolkien' can this be? But low and behold I was wrong. It proved to have a heart of its own and one with its very own creative pulse. It had a simple yet deeply enticing grace that seemed to sweep me away. I was thoroughly entertained, and impressed, save for the last predictable battle scene, which left a little to be desired. Eragon seemed to lose steam towards the end. It became more 'actiony' and 'predictable', and less naturally enticing. <br />     <br />   And that should have warned me to have lower expectations for the second book. It is very difficult to continue one's success with \\"series\\" fiction. I commend Rowling, Tolkien, and many others for succesfully doing such. This second book definitely trails off. It loses its speed, and strands itself in a sea of tedious boredom, predictability, and bland complexities. <br />    <br />   Eldest seems to grow an opinionated outside critique on life. It doesnt't feel natural at all, nor does it fit in with the initial heart of the story that compelled me in. I can hear way too much of the author's voice, and opinions in this. And it feels forced.  It doesn't make any logical sense that the Elves who deal with \\"magic, energy, and a deep love of nature\\" would be \\"Athiests\\" or \\"Agnostics\\".  I have no problem with Athiesm, nor Agnosticism, but it simply doesn't fit here. It feels out of place, and forced. I wonder if the author, being as young as he is, is unaware of various ideas of spirituality, religion besides beliefs in a \\"Personal God\\", or \\"Personal gods\\".  This was just one problem, out of many that I found in the book. But basically it is none of the little problems that I found troubling rather then the simple fact that the story in the second book is just not that good.  <br />   It is sad because Eldest in a way very much diminishes Eragon. The whole entire story has taken on this \\"video game-like\\" quality where the characters have a certain amount of energy that builds up, gets depleted, and is restored. It feels at times like I am watching someone else play a fantasy video game. And, as we all know, that is not anyone's idea of a fun. <br />   <br />  I really wish that I didn't read this second book, for as I said before, it is no where close to as good as the first. I probably won't read the third. I will forget, by then, about how compelling the first book was, and will still have a sour taste in my mouth from this second book.    <br />  If you thought that the first book was absolutely excellent then give this one a try. It is mildly interesting, and your passion for the initial book should propel you through to the end...which again was quite predictable.  But if you found the first book to be average, or even slightly above average then I would recommend staying away from this book.  It is no \\"Godfather 3\\" but it's pretty close.	2005-10-12

Starmore is a great knitting historian, and those two books mentioned are incredible resources for traditional work.<br /><br />Even this book of men's sweaters has a few nice traditional patterns that would be good for any era.  The traditional gansey that opens the book is one of these.<br /><br />However, I was quite shocked at how dated many of the patterns are in this book. As a man, I can say that in the whole book there were maybe only 2-3 sweaters I would ever be caught dead in.  My wife was more or less laughing at many of the designs.  Obviously each to their own, but be warned that this is not like Starmore's other books of 'timeless' classics.<br /><br />Also disappointing is that the book is mostly just patterns.  Alice Starmore's best stuff -- her instructional writing and knitting history writing -- is not present in this book, making it significantly less interesting than the previously mentioned Fair Isle and Aran Island books.<br /><br />It is cheaper than other Starmore books, but the lower price reflects an inferior product.  Maybe the patterns will be enough for some, but for me, if I am going to spend so much for an out of print book, I want more than just a few good patterns.<br /><br />UPDATE (2/2/2012): The price for a used copy of this book has dropped considerably since I first wrote the review.  The current price of $18, is a pretty reasonable price when you consider that there are at least 2 quality patterns in this book. At the time I wrote the original review, the price was more than $50, which IS too much considering that the majority of the patterns are not up to Starmore's usual quality level.	2005-10-12

The ramifications of this dependency (especially for American businesspersons) are explained and documented in-depth.  <br /> <br />The book includes other arguments, such as the limited proficiency of non-native English-speakers who have studied English abroad. The author also has a lot to say about globalization, and some new trends which will likely affect the status of various languages in the world. <br /> <br />The second half of the book is a roadmap for learning a foreign language. The information presented here is helpful for anyone new to language study.  <br /> <br />I would have given this book five stars but for a few minor quibbles: In the scope of a 236-page book, the author explores topics as diverse as business, world governing bodies, cultural nationalism, the war on terror, and how they relate to language. The arguments mostly ring true, but the sheer scope of the thesis might be a little too vast for the format. This might have been broken down into two separate books. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the author deserves kudos for approaching the issues from a truly original perspective. Trimnell also backs up his arguments with facts and data. You may or may not agree with him, but you'll have to respect his arguments. <br />	2005-10-12

But for Auriane, a daughter of the Germanic tribes, it's become a hell on earth. All Auriane really wanted in life was to be like her lovely mother and have a good home. But being born to the warlike Chatti tribe as the daughter of the tribes' leader insures her life will different than she planned. From her first day on earth when a powerful seer/witch woman predicts she will cause the death of her father-the greatest sin a person can commit, Auriane is different. Over her short teenage years she becomes a daughter of the earth, a warrior women sworn to protect her people, and never know the touch of a man.     Yet all along a young man in Rome, Marcus Julianus,  gutter rat who turned out to be the lost son of a Senator has been wearing a bag of dirt around his neck, a bag given to his father by a wise woman of the Chatti tribes, a bag that there is only one other like...around Auriane's neck.    Destiny collides in the fierce arena of the Roman imperial court and the terrile but lovely woods and bogs of Auriane's home. Auriane must fight for her life against the might of Rome and Marcus Julianus must fight for his own in the corrupt Emperors court...can these two people prevail?     This is a wonderful book. It's full of life, and the descriptions are so vivid I found myself wondering that I was reading a book, not falling back in time-and I am normally not a fan of ancient historical fiction at all. In fact I have purposly avoided it ever since I started reading historical fiction when I was a kid. But this book changed all that! the characters are all very real people (even the larger than life Auriane is insecure about her body) and the plot line is so vivid and realistic it's hard to stay still while reading. You will be running around, book in hand, screaming for the good guys and cursing the bad. This is probably the best book I ever read, bar none. And there is not one boring sentence in the whole book. Its chopped full of action, romance and adventure, and it's impossible to believe this is a first novel. I plan on buying another copy soon so I'll have one for mine falls apart. I'm sure I will read this book every year of my life.    I recommend this book to any one who loves history, drama, romance, or action. It has something for everyone, and I just received an email from the author saying the sequel is done (!!!) and it will be published in November of this year.

This is a really super little book which covers a number of fundamental aspects of chess strategy. Each chapter discusses a different kind of positional advantage and the correct methods for exploiting it. If I remember correctly, the topics are establishing outposts for pieces, attacking weak pawns, penetrating the enemy's position via (i) open files or (ii) a weak colour complex, positional pressure along half-open files and its connection to the strategy of the minority attack and utilizing superior mobility created by a space advantage.    One word of warning, however, this is definitely not a beginners' book on chess strategy. The discussions are quite deep and seem to me to presuppose a solid understanding of chess. On the other hand it is just perfect if you've played a few years and have a basic understanding of chess strategy that needs to be deepened. Just one example, as a chess novice I knew that rooks \\"belonged\\" on open files. But Micheal Stean taught me not only why they belong there (control of an open file aims at penentration of the enemy's position along a rank) but under what circumstances such penetration is likely to be successful or unsuccessful (e.g. unsuccessful if the enemy king defends the penetration squares on the rank, successful if you have the more active minor pieces which can stop the enemy rooks contesting the open file).      Light, small and insightful, I often take this book as a perfect travelling companion for brushing up on those basic strategic points on the go.	2005-10-12

The primary purpose of this text is to strengthen the vocabulary of the learner. It is designed with the adult learner in mind, tailoring the vocabulary and language exercises to be of use to those who are continuing their education toward GED, community college and general literacy skills.<br /><br />Each chapter of the book has three key elements - word mastery, learning strategies, and interesting features of words. In the mastering of words, each chapter presents the tried-and-true vocabulary list, to be used again and again in the course of the chapter (and repeated occasionally throughout later chapters). Several sentences are used to put the words in context. It is not simply a dull list of definitions - words are connected, and related words given.<br /><br />Learning strategies are introduced in each chapter as well. These include use of a dictionary (how can you look up a word when you don't know how to spell it?), using context clues to figure out the meaning of a word, analysing word elements by parts (prefixes, suffixes, etc.), and learning words in settings such as forms, newspapers, and other familiar settings.<br /><br />The special interest sections include articles that highlight the vocabulary (articles include the history of Ben & Jerry's, stories of how cars get named, biographical stories of famous people like Jackie Robinson, and more), as well as brief histories of words and word categories.<br /><br />Each chapter has a variety of exercises - mix and match, word association, fill in the blank, analyzing paragraphs, discussion questions for the reading passages, and more.<br /><br />The one thing I would wish for this text would be a general glossary or dictionary at the end of the book, for students to use with greater ease in looking up the meanings of words. This could be organised in the manner of a dictionary, to be useful for the dictionary use exercises, too. Other than this, `The World of Words' serves as a very useful guide in language arts, reading and writing classes, as well as for individual tutoring for those looking to enhance their basic literacy skills.of a dictionary, to be useful for the dictionary use exercises, too.

I don't think Maguire could have done anything differently, except make the initial chapters and explanations a little more compressed to keep the action moving.  <br /> <br />Liir, our mystery man and the alledged son of Elphaba, literally falls from the sky on a remote convent.  The Maunt assigns Candle, a mute Quadling with a gift for music, the task of nursing the young man back to health.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, in Liir's head, we're seeing what's happened since Elphaba's death.  We finally see the trip to Oz, his dealings with Glinda, etc.   <br /> <br />Candle's and Liir's backstory alternate til Liir wakes up.  This is about page 250 and the most interesting part of the book, IMHO.   <br /> <br />While reading SON OF A WITCH was quite a trudge, I will say that I would probably read another book in this series if it took place more in the present day.	2005-10-12

But that would require a different publisher, I suspect. OK, one step at a time:  <br /> <br />First and foremost you need to know (the others here have already mentioned this) that this book is very basic. Now, that's no great sin to be basic, provided it's made clear to the potential buyer that it's a book on basics. So, the title should have been something like \\"A Pleasantly Light Introduction to Design of [etc., etc.]\\" OK, suppose that's done, would then the book be good? Nope. Why? Because it's written asswise, that's why. Btw, the author definitely knows his stuff, he's competent, that much *is* clear TO SOMEONE WHO ALREADY KNOWS THE SAME STUFF! (And therefore does not need this book.)  <br /> <br />But a newbie -- who appears to be the only kind of reader who could benefit from this kind of book -- will not understand one page of it. The book is miserably under-edited: it's incoherent, rambling, randomly composed, revoltingly imprecise, laden with unexplicated industry jargon; the narrative jumps from topic to topic in the same paragraph; suddenly and randomly it changes from conceptual material to details of the lowest possible level totaly irrelevant in the previously assumed context, and so on and so forth. And it's not proofread (as the others here mentioned)... although, considering the rest of what's wrong with this book, I almost hesitate to mention this.  <br /> <br />Yet, like I've said, the author is competent, and so with a sufficient editorial contribution a decent book COULD have been produced. The guy knows a lot, but he's not a writer: his knowledge should have been carefully and deliberately extracted from him and then structured, laid out, articulated in an appropriate manner by a competent technical writer. But hey, that's CMP we're dealing with here, not O'Reilly or Morgan Kaufmann, right? Think up a catchy title, print the crap on the cardboard-thickness paper (to make 200pages look impressive), ship it to the stores, 49.95 a piece... 'nouf said.  <br /> <br />(As an aside: It is interesting to contrast this failure of a book to the similar recent \\"Network Algorithmics\\", by Varghese, from MK. A big difference!)	2005-10-12

On January 10, 1929, the first installment of \\"Tintin in the Land of the Soviets\\" was pubished in \\"Le Petit Vingti&egrave;m,\\" telling the story of a young reporter named Tintin and his pet foxhouse Snowy (Milou) as they journied through the Soviet Union.  The character of Tintin was modled on Paul Remi, Georges' brother, who was an officer in the Belgian army.  The result was one of the most universally beloved comic book characters in the history of the world, and this book is the fourth volume in a series that collects three of the Adventures of Tintin.<br /><br />Of course, you have been reading these in order, because if for some strange reason you start with Volume 4 then you begin with the second-half of an adventure that began in \\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\" (see Volume 3).  Although Herg&eacute; offers a bit of a recapitulation in the form of a conversation overhead in a bar at the beginning of \\"Red Rackham's Treasure,\\" you will really not be up to speed on this one. The main thing is that having collected all the clues regarding the titular treasure, Tintin and Captain Haddock are prepared to go forth and find it. However, almost as important as the search for the treasure is our introduction to the final pivotal member of the Tintin family, as Professor Cuthbert Calculus offers the service of his small shark-proof submarine for exploring the ocean floor. Tintin refuses the offer, but it turns out that Professor Calculus always hears somkething other than what somebody is really saying. Adding to the fun are the Thom(p)sons, who come alone with orders to protect Tintin.<br /><br />\\"Red Rackham's Treasure\\" is mostly a pure adventure story, with Tintin using the small submarine and a deep sea diving suit to look for the treasure of the Unicorn. But there is still some detective work left to be done to decipher the final cryptic clues left by Sir Francis Haddock concerning the treasure's location. I still like Herg&eacute;'s two-part adventure that sent Tintin to the Moon, but this two-parter is not far behind. This is the last of the Tintin stories Herg&eacute; wrote during World War II, and after this point we will definitely see his stories become much more allegorical in terms of post-War Europe. But this time around it is just Tintin, Snowy, and company out having fun beneath the deep blue sea.<br /><br />Tintin's next two-part adventure is included here as well, beginning with \\"The Seven Crystal Balls\\" and concluding in \\"Prisoners of the Sun.\\"  The story begins with Tintin on the train reading how the Sanders-Hardiman Ethnographic Expedition has returned a trip to Peru and Bolivia. The gentleman reading over Tintin's shoulder predicts trouble, drawing a parallel between what happened with the curse of King Tut-Ankh-Amen's tomb and these explorers violating the Inca's burial chambers. \\"What'd we say if the Egyptians or the Peruvians came over here and started digging up our kings?,\\" asks the gentleman; What'd we say then, eh?\\" The comment is important, not only because tragedy does strike the seven members of the expedition as they fall prey to the Crystal Balls of the book's title, but because one of the themes that Herg&eacute; develops in this particular epic is the respect Europeans should have for other cultures and ways of life.<br /><br />This point has been implict in many of Tintin's adventures, but it is a dominant element this time around. Assissted by his good friend Captain Haddock, Tintin becomes embroiled in the mystery, which takes a more personal turn when Professor Calculus is kidnapped. One interesting twist in this story is that Snowy actually ends up causing more trouble thanthe Thom(p)sons. There is a seriousness to what happens in \\"The Seven Crytal Balls\\" and \\"Prisoners of the Sun\\" that reflects a significant turning point in Herg&eacute;'s work, laying the ground work for his greatest tales, the two-part Moon story and \\"Tintin in Tibet.\\"<br /><br />\\"Prisoners of the Sun\\" concludes the epic Tintin adventure as the Sanders-Hardiman Ethnographic Expedition returns from a trip to Peru and Bolivia exploring Inca burial chambers when all seven members fell into comas induced by mysterious crystal balls. Tintin is already involved in the mystery when Professor Calculus is kidnapped and put aboard a steamer bound for Peru. With Snowy and Captain Haddock in tow, Tintin arrives in South America ready to rescue his friend and solve the mystery of the curse of the Incas. This involves a journey through the Andes Mountains and the jungles of the rain forest.<br /><br />There is seriousness to what happens in \\"The Seven Crystal Balls\\" and \\"Prisoners of the Sun\\" that reflects a significant turning point in Herg&eacute;'s work. The point that Europeans need to respect the cultures of other peoples is not only explicitly articulated by Tintin in these volumes, but is reinforced by the attention to details he puts into Tintin's visit to foreign lands. The ability of Herg&eacute; to grow as a storyteller over the course of his distinguished career is impressive and these stories deserve the accolades they have received and the affection with which they have been embraced by generations of readers. I have always liked his foray into science fiction with the two-part Moon story, but Herg&eacute; never did anything any better than this Incan epic. \\"Prisoners of the Sun\\" also has one of Herg&eacute;'s best running gags: no, not the perpetual confrontations between Captain Haddock and the llamas, but the attempt by the Thom(p)sons to use dowsing to help solve the case.ppens in \\"The Seven Crytal Balls\\" and \\"Prisoners of the Sun\\" that reflects a significant turning point in Herg's work, laying the ground work for his greatest tales, the two-part Moon story and \\"Tintin in Tibet.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Prisoners of the Sun\\" concludes the epic Tintin adventure as the Sanders-Hardiman Ethnographic Expedition returns from a trip to Peru and Bolivia exploring Inca burial chambers when all seven members fell into comas induced by mysterious crystal balls.

I have enjoyed all of his storys since I read Arundel years ago.  He was a masterful storyteller, and his knowledge of the history and culture of the times is unequaled.  I have long felt that his books are timeless and should be required reading in both high school and college.  He wrote fiction, but you cannot get a similar feeling for the times and people in any history book.  He brought to life the great leaders of this period such as Arnold, Schyler, Roberts, Thompson, and so many others in a way no history book could.  All of his books are great reads and worthy of our attention.  Oliver Wiswell is unique to Roberts and perhaps to American literature.  I had never considered \\"the other side\\" of the revolution.  We were taught about the great patriots, but loyalists and the likes of Benedict Arnold were always traitors.  This book reveals the fallacy of that teaching.  It also shows the great tragedy that was the American Revolution.  I had never considered it to be another civil war, but that was precisely what it was.  The \\"patriots\\" were not that different from the \\"loyalists\\", and in many cases they were worse.  The darkest and most ugly part of that civil war was the division that was borne between people who equally loved their country.  There are reflections of all of that in our times as politicians in the name of freedom and democracy seek to divide us.  The lessons of history are for all times.  Anyway, you MUST read this book.	2005-10-12

She tells the distressing story of what is was like to raise her daughter Nancy and watch her disintegrate before her eyes while she had to stand back after the medical community failed them both terribly.  Nancy Spungen was eighties punk rock icon Sid Vicious' girlfriend.  Their tumultuous rock and roll romance ended abruptly when he stabbed her to death in New York's Chelsea Hotel.  Nancy's life was a personal hell for herself and her mother and only became public when Nancy became involved with Sid.  Sid was lead singer for the Sex Pistols who in spite of only putting out two albums and performing less than fifty times became a legendary band whose name is known far and wide even outside the punk community.   <br /> <br />     Nancy was a mentally exhausting infant and toddler because she screamed incessantly for reasons no doctors ever found.  She had an above average intelligence level once reaching school age and the reasons for her anguish were never fully revealed.  Doctor's only answers for Nancy's problems were to over medicate her which led Nancy to the hellish existence of a heroin addict.  Nancy met Sid when he was early in his fame and turned him onto the drug heroin then the two spent years shooting up, getting clean, falling off the wagon, and making a name for themselves in their highly unstable lives.   <br /> <br />     Deborah Spungen reveals very private tragedy's that occurred as a result of her daughter's draining pull on the family.  Things like affairs, extreme sibling rivalry, and a constant flow of money going to institutions and psychiatric centers in desperate attempts to rehabilitate Nancy are just the tip of the iceberg of the problems caused by having a daughter like Nancy.  I could feel Deborah's anguish in every line written in spite of being initially unsure of whether or not a mother could give an honest account of a daughter's life.  I camefrom a strict home life and later because a drug addict (sober 8 years now) and can't imagine the book my mom would write about raising me.  I was sure Deborah would place the blame on Nancy and make herself out to be a saint or at least spend the entire book as a martyr but no such thing occurred.   The only blame placed was on the medical community for failing to try to do anything for the young Nancy and on Deborah by herself for not pushing harder and questioning doctors more.  Although I think she went above and beyond her duty to find help for her baby.   <br />     Deborah leaps into new memoir territory telling Nancy's story, her own, and her families to help us dissect, understand, and hopefully learn from their tragedy.  Deborah commands us to listen and forces us to see the soft white underbelly of Nancy's life which was painful, sad, and hopeless right from the beginning much different then what you would know of Nancy reading anything else about her at the time of the murders or since then.  This American nightmare is a must read for mothers, daughters, sisters, brothers, fathers, punk rockers, addicts, and mostly physicians in a hope that next time they will do more then poo poo a concerned mother.	2005-10-12

I think this book is destined to disappoint a lot of readers - it falls short of technical implementation details needed by programmers, and will probably be too technical for business executives wanting to understand more in general terms about the topic.  Project managers who are considering implementing web services may find the book useful, but I'd recommend browsing it first.<br /><br />I found that the writing style of this particular book was turgid and difficult to follow.  It was riddled throughout with spelling errors and cliche, filler phrases and poorly-conceived charts and diagrams.

This is a very informative book that thoroughly researches and debunks Mr. Warnke's claims about being a Satanic priest and at the same time spills the beans about his lavish lifestyle, supported by the unwitting dupes who contributed to his ministry. It is true that Mike is very entertaining: I still have several of his tapes and listen to them occasionally. If you want to buy his comedy material, it is still very funny stuff, and the comedy is not too dated despite being recorded in the 80's and early 90's. I certainly have no problem with Mr. Warnke's use of funds he earned with his recordings, but the money he received as contributions to his \\"ministry\\" to fight satanism were the fruits of a slick con-job. Regarding I. Williams' one-star rating of this book, perhaps in the spirit of his criticism, we should also overlook Adolf Hitler's behavior because he was sincere, and loved dogs.	2005-10-12

This author packs a lot of story into her pages and expertly sweeps the reader along without missing anything important. Her writing is stylish and humorous, and also packed with wonderful descriptions and observations. I couldn't put this book down. It's one of my best buys this year.	2005-10-12

Rowling:  Educator in Christian Virtues	This book is much better than Granger's earlier \\"Hidden Key to Harry Potter.\\"  Be aware that it was written before Half-Blood Prince was published.  Granger, a self-described \\"traditional Christian,\\" has moved from initial suspicion of the Potter books to finding Christian truth embedded in them; he compares Rowling to the noted Christian fantasy writers C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. He has assembled a formidable array of arguments, using everything from medieval heraldry to Christian theology.  Some of his explanations are rather long but they are relevant.  While he makes an occasional error (he says that James' and Dumbledore's friendship is the reason Dumbledore protects Harry after James dies), his analysis of the patterns in the novels and of the characters' interactions is good.  He believes Rowling is making use of the medieval alchemical approach to spiritual growth (note: this does NOT mean he's trying to turn base metals into gold!) and makes a good case.  His explanation of this process is thorough and his application of it to the books is helpful, as is his explanation of the relationship among Dumbledore, Harry, and Voldemort.  This is a helpful book for any who want a defense against the claim that Rowling's work is dangerous and satanic.	2005-10-12

I am a fan of Mary Monroe's...I could not wait to read this book as I have enjoyed so many titles of Mrs.Monroe's....but I could've done without this one. I had so many issues with this book I do not know where to start. First of all there a too many people in this story, I mean to sit through all of the introductions is almost mind numbing. I did not feel the story-line was had any substance. I was bored at times while reading this book. I also did not understand why this book was set in present time and everybody in the book sounded as if it was 30-40 years ago. Why did they have names like \\"Lula Mae, Odessa, Verna, and Rosalee\\"? I kept forgetting it was present time and thought it was the 1960's or something. Obviously Monroe is a excellent writer, we know that from previous books, but her element is writing about the past. Some of the \\"slang\\" in this novel was just horrible. The one person that kept this book from being a one was Helen. In a way I felt the book should've been about her. She is the only one that I really cared about. I wish the book would've been written for her, Lula's and Rockell's POV.....I did not need the other 7 characters. So if you are looking for a good read that compares to the likes of \\"God Don't Like Ugly\\" \\"God Still Don't Like Ugly\\" and \\"The Upper Room\\", then do not read this book. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

This book improved our lives	Anyone suffer from migraines, post nasal drip, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, feeling sick often?  How about achy joints or vision problems? <br /> <br />My wife bought me this book because I was intermittently suffering from intense migraines only after playing hockey.  I couldn't figure out what was triggering them.  People were telling me I must have health problems, etc.  I heard it all.  The doctors I saw couldn't figure out what was causing them either, but recommended keeping a food journal.  It turns out that MSG in food (even up to 48 prior) was causing these intense migraines-which leave you miserable for days afterwards. <br /> <br />The information inside this book is amazing and shocking.  There are so many names for MSG--the food companies keep trying to hide the truth.  Inside this book you will find a complete breakdown and explanation of most of the hidden names for MSG and other dangerous neurotoxins that are in almost everything in our kitchens, at restaurants, etc.   <br />I was very disturbed to find out that the amount of MSG in food has been doubling every ten years-and there is no regulation.  In fact, food companies don't even have to list the ingredients, and they can simply put \\"Natural Flavors\\" on the labels, when they are hiding the adding of significant amounts of MSG and related chemicals.    <br />Why do they get away with this? <br /> Once again, the FDA apparently seems to have been bought.  It is estimated that 40% of the US population is sensitive to MSG-so why is it in all of our food?  Because food companies make more money when their products taste better.  And thank the lobbyists too-they get rich with their bribery and propaganda-lying to the population-saying that MSG, and aspartame are safe.  <br />The problem with this book is that it will expose the danger in your diets.  If you are sensitive to MSG (and most people are) and other related neurotoxins that your friendly food companies pump into their products, you will find that almost all the food in your kitchen contains unsafe chemicals that they shouldn't.  <br />Okay, so maybe you knew \\"bad stuff\\" was in soy sauce and ALL ketchup-except organic, most canned soups, etc.; but did you know it was also in your ice cream (carrageenan), dairy products-cheeses, cereals, sprayed on fruits and vegetables, most all snacks-look for \\"hydrolyzed proteins\\" and \\"protein isolates?\\"  It sucks, but it's true. <br /> <br />This book has changed our lives for the better-I bought this book for everyone in our family. <br /> <br />Thanks to the author for such a great reference book.   <br />	2005-10-12

FISHKILL, NEW YORK - BookSurge announces the publication of Mental Mathematics by Michael A. Stelzer. <br />For anyone sitting in a restaurant while attempting to calculate the tip, this book is the answer. For anyone working on a fairly complicated equation and discovering that the batteries in the calculator are dead, this book is the answer. Michael A. Stelzer's Mental Mathematics is a boon for all those people who need to do mathematical calculations quickly and accurately...in their head.  <br />In Mental Mathematics, Stelzer shares techniques that have amazed for two decades. Using his system, it is not only possible to work out solutions in the mind, but to do so in less time (and with greater speed) than most people need when using a calculator. What's required? Nothing more than a sound knowledge of mathematics and a desire to calculate quickly, effortlessly and accurately. The process is based on logic: break down the problem into manageable components and then restructure those components to form the solution.    <br />Michael Stelzer understands how the brain works. After developing a program in which he taught himself to speak French, German and Mandarin Chinese, he wrote Learn a Language Your Own Way, an explanation of his straightforward, logical system for self-taught languages.  <br />Mental Mathematics takes the challenge and the fear out of using math in everyday situations. From the most basic calculations to the most advanced, Mental Mathematics adds up to one important book.   <br /> <br />Author bio: <br />Author Michael Stelzer holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering. He has distinguished himself in martial arts, bodybuilding and fencing. A Navy veteran, he holds novice certification in several languages. He is the National Champion of the American Martial Arts alliance 2005 in traditional forms, is a member of the U.S. Fencing Association, and has won medals in numerous bodybuilding competitions. Mental Mathematics is Michael Stelzer's thirdbook. <br />	2005-10-12

Michael Savage is brilliant as well as entertaining. Yet much like the very inflamatory Islamic preachers he so dislikes, his words act on the same feelings that they evoke. Nationalistic pride and xenophobia are the hallmarks of Savage and those he hates. <br /> <br />Beware the logical fallacies underlying his entertaing style. He has more in common with Osama bin Laden than you might think.  <br /> <br />If you imagine that Savage is really an Islamist Imam issuing sermons and fatwas you can begin to see how subversive this way of thinking is for both America and the Middle East. He sort of looks like one too.....???? <br /> <br />Liberals should read him to understand right wing extremists and right wing extremists should read it to understand what motivates thier enemies - Islamofascists! It is what motivates themselves. Savage translated to Arabic would be a bestseller for unemployed young males. <br /> <br />In reality Savage hates liberals in the same way that Osama does. <br />There is a saying: the \\"Enemy of my Enemy is my friend\\" and if Liberals are his enemy (Liberals, homosexuals, Feminists, Intellectuals) and are also the enemy of Osama (they are) then by REAL logic, Osama must be friend of Savage. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

Basic plot: members of a family look over three generations and try to discover love. Artistic content: some transcendent realization outside of form. Is it good? Yes, it's good - not great. It's very easy to read, although the latter half of it has some sections that need to be skimmed for their utter lack of relevance. Napolitano uses common English to craft an inoffensive narrative.

My stick figures were bad before I started to go through this book. I have only really been working on learning how to draw for about a week, at the time of this review.

It is difficult now to appreciate both how audacious an undertaking it represents, and how astonishing its immediate and continued success was.  Over the course of twelve books Milton wrote an epic poem that would ''justify the ways of God to men,'' a mission that required a complex drama whose source is both historical and deeply personal.  The struggle for ascendancy between God and Satan is played out across hell, heaven, and earth but the consequences of the Fall are all too humanly tragic--pride, ambition, and aspiration the motivating forces.'  In this new edition derived from their Oxford Authors text, Stephen Orgel and Jonathan Goldberg discuss the complexity of Milton's poem in a new introduction, and on-page notes explain its language and allusions.\\"	2005-10-12

None of these questions are answered in more than fleeting, trivial terms. <br /> <br />What is endlessly, monotonously explored is the target planet, whose inhabitants are identical to humans, to within an engineering approximation, in almost every aspect. What a monumental lack of imagination! <br /> <br />I actually put this book in the recycling when I was finished. I am bewildered by the other positive reviews here. To each his own, I guess, and truth be told, I'm not a writer and respect anyone who can put together a book full of words. But yikes...	2005-10-12

Boyd hits on real life situations when a person can be in their darkest moments. It shows how prayer can be expressed in the depths of despair as an open dialog with God. He touches on several different aspects of life sincerely and honestly. His prayers show the importance of communicating your true feelings regardless if you are going through unpleasant times or the mondane.  <br />I found myself in his writings. This book showed me how prayer can improve your attitude. He wrote things that I have felt but was too ashamed to express to anyone let alone myself. He also showed me the importance of letting God in during these times. It was refreshing to read prayers written in the darkest of times that were still respectful and praiseworthy.	2005-10-12

Every book has something original about itself and as the story progresses, the characters grow more mature and deep, as well as the story itself grows darker. <br /> <br />The Half-Blood Prince reaches the crucial moment in which everything is set for the final battle (book 7). The possibility of vitory as well as the growing conflict are placed and \\"the board is set\\" so that the next chapter focuses in conclusions and answers. <br /> <br />Rowling keeps surprising me with her writting so easy to read for a kid and still enyoable for an adult. The dialog is smart and funny when it needs to be, and the plot thickens as it becomes a little more mature. <br /> <br />Mystery is key to Harry Potter novels, and this chapter presents some answers to past mysteries in the series as well as new mysteries (\\"R.A.B.\\" - those who have read it get me). <br /> <br />The evolution of some characters like Snape are amazing, and once again Rowling provides with a smart and fun plot to follow, although this time, it's a little more dense.  <br /> <br />Unlike the previous books, this one starts different (no Harry's prespective, but a narrator point of view) and the complexity of concepts and twists rises (a lot of memories regarding Voldemort's quest for immortality, as well as explanations about how his mind and his approach to magic works). The sixth book is defenitly the most mature of the series so far, leaving even Phoenix behind in terms of darkness and complexity. <br /> <br />The series has reached a point where everything is uncertain regarding the future and the past, and Harry certainly grows up here. This may not be the best of the series, but it is indeed the step needed to conclude the story next book, as this one sets everything up for the next chapter to flow. <br /> <br />Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is an amazing piece of fantasy, teen issues, smart and fun dialog, character development and revelations that build the pillars needed to conlude the series with a bang.	2005-10-12

It was an interesting read but not what I expected.   <br />It is my own fault.  I bought it because the title (Physics and Finance) caught my eye and the average rating and number of reviews was high.  I would guess it is not a heavily embellished memoir.  Emanuel appears to be an honest, practical and educated individual.  I found myself in the beginning wondering when I would start to read something about his life as a Quant.  I don't know the exact page but I was probably half way through the book before I got my first taste.  <br /> <br /> In the end I found it like most things I have not personally experienced, it is more romantic to dream than live.  This is not to say he didn't do good things.  It just means for every minute of success and enjoyment there are hundreds if not thousands of minutes of grind and perseverance.  The grind is not always so well documented. <br /> <br />Due to my age, I did find myself identifying with Emanuel as he changed from a wide eyed youth ready to change the world to a more pragmatic successful adult.  I still envy the enthusiasm lack of experience provides younger people.   <br /> <br />I wouldn't recommend it to someone looking for insights in to physics or finance.  I would recommend it to someone is in the field or aspires to be in the field.     <br />	2005-10-12

The premise is both simple to understand and quite intriguing.  A man has lost his knowledge of his self and his life, but continues to remember the things that he has read and seen that do not actually relate to him.  If yesterday he sat down with his wife and ate breakfast while watching the news, then it would be the news alone that is in his head today. <br /> <br />Starting off in this way, the novel appears to be a sort of coming of age again novel.  An exploration of self, unbiased by actually having lived the life and seeing it from your side.  A great gate is opened in the opening of this book. <br /> <br />Unfortunately after the gates swings open the main character does not charge through to the awaiting world, but merely leans against said gate.  It really is a shame. <br /> <br />The story consists almost entirely of a man, alone, going through the children items collected in his late parents' attic.  And, as the character goes through these things there is a brief narrative of what was happening as these items came into being.   <br /> <br />There are definately interesting parts in this wanderings, but in the end they turn out to be simply wandering.  There is really no tying together at the end or any great message derived from any of the pieces of the old life that he finds.   <br /> <br />In the end Umberto teaches us a lesson from the Bible.  Do not sew together an old cloak with new patches.  The fabric stretches and wears in different directions and the whole is only made more severe. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

Set in England in the year before the outbreak of the First World War, this story concerns an anarchist named Felix, and his efforts to assassinate a Russian Prince, who is visiting England to cement a treaty of mutual protection in the event of hostilities with Germany. The anarchist, a Russian who has endured much injustice in his life (so much, in fact, he has somehow lost the capacity to feel fear in his plummet from idealistic pacifist to hardened killer)  is no purposeless psychopath.  Though he has come to regard himself as \\"lost\\" Felix holds out hope that if the chains of tyranny can be lifted from the peoples of Europe, then peace and goodness might rise. He sees no need for governments or for law. He feels humans can best direct themselves and authority is by definition corrupt. It is to the end of disrupting the treaty between the two powers, England and Russia, that Felix travels to London in 1914, intent on stopping the alliance and making war that much less attractive to the great powers. Opposing Felix is an English Earl named Walden, who, unknown to both men, has a unlikely mutual connection with Felix from the past-the Earl's wife. This novel moves at a brisk pace and flashes through the underworld of post-Edwardian London, as well as its halls of government. Winston Churchill is a minor figure in this book, although most others, including the memorable eighteen-year-old Charlotte Walden, at the time of the novel, supposedly a ninety-two-year-old  friend of Follette's, are fictional constructs. I found this novel skillfully rendered and immensely  enjoyable. It is possibly the best of the novels Ken Follette composed before his turned out his 1989 masterpiece: The Pillars of the Earth.	2005-10-12

Most of us Westerners by now are awakening to the fact that Islam is not a \\"Religion of Peace\\" or that it is \\"The most tolerant of faiths.\\"  Too many bombs have gone off. We have believed these lies because we wanted to and because they fit into our assumptions about how a religion should be practiced.  In our mythical universe we liken Mohammed to Jesus - a benevolent man wandering around the Arabian desert preaching goodness to ones fellow man. At some point though, you have become suspicious that maybe there is something about Islam...that caused well-educated men fly airplanes into buildings, to yell Allah Akbar! when they sawed off the head of an infidel, to blow up a train, a hotel, a subway and themselves.  There is something about Islam...and Robert Spencer will tell you.  Everything he says is well documented and referenced so that you can check it out for yourself in case you don't want believe him.  Still, people will call him an Islamophobe.  They do not want to hear the truth. They do not want you to know the truth. That Mohammed was in reality a warrior, had all the men in a villiage beheaded, then handed over their wives and children to be slaves and raped by his followers.  They do not want to hear that as an old man he married a 6 year old, then consumated it with her at age nine and still playing with dolls. They do not want to hear that he told all his followers not to associate with us filthy infidels and that Jews are apes and pigs.  And yet he did.  All these things are in the Koran and documented in \\"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (And the Crusades).  Find out for yourself.	2005-10-12

Unfortunately, her lack of credibility seriously taints what might have been a useful book.  <br /> <br />Why, for example, is there no mention of Ann Rule, who has written numerous books that are case studies of real-life sociopaths? While those books aren't 'academic' either, they are detailed, factual, and full of real-life examples of sociopaths and their tactics. This book is none of those. Worse, it is written in the usual mushy, verbose non-quantitative style of a therapist.  <br /> <br />As another reviewer rightly notes, the description of military personalities is nonsense, probably just speculation by the author. The single most obvious characteristic of a fighting unit is the emotional bonds between the men. Those bonds are what allow a man to put his life in the hands of others, and are what drive soldiers to acts of heroism (or even death) to protect his buddies in the squad. Unfeeling? Hardly.  <br /> <br />It is interesting that the author and all the reviewers have missed completely the most visible sociopath of the last two decades, if not more. This person exhibits every single trait of a sociopath, and does so obviously; has a work history of power seeking, numerous broken people on his back trail, is charming, cunning, and manipulative; is noted by all around him, including supporters to have an extraordinary ability to compartmentalize his emotions; lies constantly; uses people and exposes them to danger for his own needs (and then abandons them), responds to people and events in a purely objective and manipulative way. His name is Bill Clinton, and his exclusion from the author's thoughts is both obvious and telling.	2005-10-12

I don't own a Nordhavn 62 (I wish) and my seafaring is limited to adolescent adventures in my small sailing skiff and the occasional offshore fishing trip, venturing out not much past 20 miles from the shore. I had followed the adventures of the Nordhavn sponsored 18-boat convoy on the Trawler Transat website where I  read Ken Williams' fascinating emails of his experiences on the Sans Souci, his Nordhavn 62 in the \\"fast boat\\" portion of the expedition. This book is NOT a further revision of Jim Leishman's (Nordhavn CEO)1993 update of Beebe's 1975 \\"bible\\" for power boat circumnavigators.  <br /> <br />It is not an edited digest of his informative emails, but rather a compilation of them. This said, they are quite useful in that Williams is not an experienced offshore navigator, but admits that prior to this venture, his trips have been limited to sight-of-land excursions offshore, never exceeding 8 hours. They upgraded to the N62 simply because they wanted an eminently seaworthy vessel capable of handling whatever rough seas they might encounter in their short hops. So the book is written in an accessible style, from the vantage point of a retired software designer who needed a lot of hand-holding on this bold adventure. The group of 18 were, as the origin might indicate, largely made up of Nordhavns, though it was not limited to craft from that builder.  <br /> <br />Notwithstanding the journal format, the book contains a lot of information on how to prepare, provision, and maintain a power boat on a long-diatance cruise spanning open ocean. There are some overview or stock-taking synopses as well as other viewpoints, such as that of the chef and Ken Williams' wife Roberta.  <br /> <br/>All in all, an informative, entertaining and salty tale and a <br />good one or two evening's read. The ample photos nicely complement the text. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

His message is about empowerment. He works to empower not only women and girls, but all people struggling with SI and anorexia. I have heard him on the radio and in a lecture and found him to be not only knowledgeable, and experienced, but a compassionate humanitarian. In fact, I am taken aback and unhappily surprised by some of the more vicious reviews I just read that seem like odd, personal vendettas. The important point about this book is that it is a fountain of valuable information collected by an experienced therapist. Steven Levenkron has made a name for himself by devoting his life's work to understanding diseases that society has previously considered mysterious and unsolvable and worked on not only demystefying them but making them relevant topics in mainstream society. This has insured that the ill are not overlooked or forgotten. This book gives practical information about an illness as well as offering a relatable view on those suffering from it. It is a beacon of light, with a very important, poignant message.	2005-10-12

Sometimes words have multiple meanings, and the synonym for one meaning might be inappropriate for another meaning, so the main entries break down these multiple pieces for ease of use.<br /><br />Primary entries have definitions, usage examples, and synonyms; secondary entries lack the examples, and cross-reference to major entries.  Homographs (words spelled the same way with different meanings) are also split into multiple entries based on this variation of meaning.<br /><br />Roget's Thesaurus also uses standard dictionary labeling, so that one can identify the part of speech (noun, verb, etc.), as well as other identifying information (slang terms, informal, regional, etc.).  Variations are very interesting to discover, as different words have meanings that go beyond their standard usage.<br /><br />A thesaurus is a very valuable tool for those who wish to increase their vocabulary, as well as increase the richness of their spoken and written language in actual practice - it is not uncommon for one to know the words listed, but to have the presence of mind to use alternative words is another matter.  Dipping into a thesaurus on an occasional basis yields rewards; plunging in on a regular basis will really enhance the command of the language.<br /><br />There are few sources as adequate to the task as Roget's.the task as Roget's. <br />	2005-10-12

Rather, the states and their people have a co-equal right to make that determination, and further, as the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions rightly provide, our state governments have the authority and duty to protest, resist, and nullify those laws, rulings and actions of the federal government that encroach upon the reserved sovereign rights of the states and their people to make decisions within the scope of their reserved powers exclusively through their elected state legislatures. If you want to know what Thomas Jefferson would say about the unconstitutionally overgrown state of our dictatorial federal government and the solution for restoring a Constitutional, limited federal government, then Mr. Watkins' book is a must. <br /> <br />Martyn Babitz, Esquire, Author of THE ILLUSION OF FREEDOM: How To Restore The True Constitution And Reclaim Liberty Now	2005-10-12

I am VERY familiar with this book, having read it at night to my 11 year old son for months now!  We just finished it.  He loved it--he is a huge geography buff and was fascinated with the glimpes of so many cultures around the world.  We both learned a lot about people and countries we had known nothing or very little about before now.<br /><br />A few small things would have made this a much better book, however!  I would have loved to have a small map on each 2 page spread about a culture, so that we could have seen exactly where the people talked about lived.  I'd have liked very much to have some of the words in other languages spelled out phonetically, as I was often guessing wildly at how things were said.  I also wish the book would have focused a little less on exotic and unusual cultures and a little more on more common cultures---the former was very interesting, but the latter would have given us probably a more realistic world view!<br /><br />My sons are annoyed that I am writing so many complaints!

This book gives a comprehensive chronology of automobile parking in the US throughout the 20th century.  The book shows how parking, and the space required for it, is often underestimated, but once allocated for, changes the surrounding environment in many ways that are often harmful.   <br /> <br />The book shows how city blocks fall prey to parking, how the presence or absence of it affects surrounding businesses, how it affects flow of both cars and pedestrians, and how an entire business has grown up around the provision of parking to communities.  The book shows the development of parking (structures, theory, laws and regulations) throughout urban, rural and suburban areas throughout the 20th century.   <br /> <br />Significant events are included, such as the invention of the parking meter in Oklahoma City, the debate over angled versus straight-on stalls, the rise of the parking garage industry, and changes in city rules and regulations over parking.  The book also provides several case studies showing how specific cities have been changed due to parking concerns.  These include Detroit, L.A., and Boston.   <br /> <br />The book is missing several things though concerning this issue.  First, the book does not cover how cars have been designed vis-a-vis parking requirements.  Second, the book does not give firm numbers as to the costs of different types of parking lots and how this depends on the surrounding architecture, ground, cityscape, and climate.  Last, the book should provide statistics comparing how the different states and cities have dealt with parking issues, and how this correlates with rates of car theft, car accidents, automobile collisions, and automobile pollution. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a goodbook to learn about a largely unknown topic.  I recommend it, though it can be quite boring to read.	2005-10-12

Hannibal is quite possibly the strongest, most engaging title in the Hannibal Lector series to date.  In it we finally get a true glimpse into the mind of this disturbing and yet intrigueing individual.  You find yourself disgusted by and yet cheering for him through much of the book, a feeling that be every bit as disturbing as his actions themselves.  Clarice Starling also makes a comeback and reafirms Harris' talent for writing strong, effective female protagonists.  This book is insanely engaging (I read the whole thing in just a little over a day) and I highly recommend it.	2005-10-12

I came back to it on discovering recently that The Cat's Fugue is a real piece of music by Scarlatti (Sonata 30 in Kirkpatrick numbering). It has become one of my favorites. Other memorable associations are with whistling, pennies, and Robert Heinlein's story The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag (also involving a non-existent floor in a building). <br /> <br />Yes, indeed, The 13th is Magic needs to be brought back into print, or else the copyright laws brought back to sanity. Under the old rules (28 years, renewable for another 28), its copyright would have run from 1950 to 2006. Now I don't even know how long it is protected (author's lifetime plus 75 years=??, but certainly later than 2025), to the profit of nobody, not the author, not the publishers, and especially not the children.	2005-10-12

The main character Jess Aarons becomes close friends with the new girl Leslie Burke.  They become absolutely inseparable despite the fact that Leslie is different and isn't liked by many and plus she's a girl.  The theme friendship and dealing with hardships runs throughout this novel. <br />  <br /> I rated this novel easily, with 5 stars.  If I could I would give it more stars, that's how much I like this book.  First of all it's really easy to read which makes it easier to focus on the plot instead of the difficult vocabulary found in many books.  The book is approximately 150 pages long which is relatively short.  The one thing about this novel that I really like is that unlike fantasy novels you can relate to the characters and themes in this book.  The theme of friendship everyone can relate to.  Everyone can relate to meeting your best friend for the first time and the exciting \\"adventures\\" you had with them as a child.  Elementary school recess is also a theme in the book everyone can relate to.  We all remember having recess where the boys played the sports and the girls talked or played their \\"girly\\" games.  It was unheard of that the girls played with the boys.  This book takes you back to your childhood and its nice to go back to your childhood every once in a while.  Not only is this book a nostalgic easy read it also has a dramatic ending that will utterly shock you.  So if you want a great book with a great story line and ending you should definitely read A Bridge to Terabithia, by Katherine Paterson.   <br />	2005-10-12

Tiresome though the overly lengthy descriptions can be, there're less annoying this time. The characterisation is more straightforward, major plotlines are resolved, some of which are long prophesized.  <br /> <br />Ok, so far I've only talked about how it isn't as bad as COS and POD. Now I'll talk about what I felt was good.  <br />The overall epic mood of the story seems to have come back. The buildup to the resolution of certain plotlines, though slow, have a gritty hands on feel to it.  <br />The characters are more real and serious this time. This time, conflicts end with nice quick deaths or submissions. No more pointless conflicts that last for books and books. In fact, a lot of supporting characters are killed off, and I rather liked the fact that RJ didn't stuff the ensuing grief down our throats. I think its so much more poignant when readers are left to empathise for themselves. <br />The courtship of Tuon was rather funny, and its rather satisfying how Mat, my fav hero, showed that he was nobody's Toy.  <br />RJ seems to have tried pruning its writing, its now more entertaining and informative, though still in a somewhat long-winded way. But the long-windedness doesn't drag down the storytelling to a standstill anymore. Even when a chapter is only building up to something bigger at the end, its still contains enough interesting info, jokes, tactics, and shock to make the read worthwhile. <br />And ooooh, Morgase starts channelling for real instead of whining about how she's too weak to even try. Should be fun when Queen Elayne finally meets her mom, hehehe. <br />And Vandene gets her revenge! <br />And there's finally a glimmer of hope of seeing Moiraine again, though Light knows if she'll actually escape alive since I dun think it was mentioned anywhere that Rand needs her to win the Last Battle <br /> <br />And the bad. <br />I really really hate Egwene, ever since she brutally bullied Nynaeve in Book 5, and then felt no shame at all in what she did. RJ wants to make her great, but he's doing it at the expense of dumbing down her friends, enemies and predicaments. When you read KOD and think how great she is, then start thinking how well she'll cope if she was under Therava, forced to swear fealty under the oathrod, and there's no Healing allowed after each torture session. Or if she's being held by Darkfriends instead.  <br />Next, a few chapters are from the POV of obscure Seanchan or other minor characters. I dun know them well enough to care about reading several pages of their POV, so I wish RJ had just summarized their POV into a few paragraphs.  <br />Next, the buildup to resolving certain plotlines are unneccessarily slow. Such as the rescue of Faile. And also Elayne's claiming of the Throne. Everybody KNOWS the outcome already, and its not like these are important enough to be foretold in the prophecies or have any obvious dire consequences.  <br />Next, its always the women that get caught and tortured! And usually by other women. Does RJ have repressed sadistic S/M tendencies? Why can't the men, especially the men Forsaken, get caught and tortured? I thought there was a chance of seeing at least the capture of a male forsaken in female flesh, but alas, not even that. <br /> <br />Oh, and the monkey-see-monkey-do whiny reviews online and everywhere else are the worst part about reading WOT. Thank the Light I dun have to read them unless I'm feeling particularly psychotic. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

The answer - this fantastic author can take the overdone and give it new life!  In The Planets, Dava Sobel takes the reader on a tour of planetary astronomy and the 9 objects currently classified as major planets plus the Sun and the Moon with 12 very different chapters and no feeling of having read a few chapters in an astronomy textbook.  Chapters 7 [SCI-FI (Mars)] and 10 [NIGHT AIR (Uranus and Neptune)] have the most interesting points of view.  Chapter 7 is narrated by ALH84001, the famous Martian meteorite that contains possible signs of life, and Chapter 10 is written as a long letter from aging astronomer Caroline Herschel (sister of the discoverer of Uranus) to American astronomer Maria Mitchell.  This is the kind of book I'd recommend to an avid reader who usually avoids books on science.  I enjoyed this book immensely and would recommend to anyone with an interest in astronomy and history.  I'm getting my copy of The Planets into my high school library as quickly as possible.	2005-10-12

I have crossed my T's and dotted my I's, so be wise - read my little red book!<br /><br />Meredith Merriweather is writing a book on the rakes and rouges of London's Society.  She is hoping to help other women avoid moments like when she was jilted by Lord Pomeroy, which by the way was not her fault.  Meredith gets this harebrained idea to spy on London's most noted rake, Lord Alexander Lansing, in none other than, a hot air balloon.

This crash-landing, will forever change the course of Meredith and Alexander's lives.<br /><br />A Lady's Guide to Rakes is by author Kathryn Caskie.

Only the ballot box keeps them in check. <br /> <br />Now I happen to think that this is a pretty decent plan.  It beats what we have now.  If you don't get anything else get this: <br /> <br />The cost of something is paid by someone a.k.a. There's no such thing as a free lunch.  The only question is who's paying. <br /> <br />I happen to think that the consumers of goods and services should have to pay for them, except for charity that we extend to the most needy.  I do think the tax base should be extended so that the responsibility of funding government be paid by all who consume, except again, those we extend charity to. <br /> <br />Boortz and Linder are on the right track, and I applaud them for at least putting their necks out and extending ideas, as so few are willing to do.  I am taking Boortz at his word that he is not making $$$ off the book.  If he's lying, then he can take that up with the righteous judge who is better at that sort of thing than I. <br /> <br />If someone has a better idea, that is fair, impartial, and spreads the pain equitably (and I mean gores your ox too), then please step forward, write a book, put yourself in the public eye for all to see and we will judge it on its' merits. <br /> <br />If all you want to do is criticize and yammer on and not bring any suggestions to the table, then please refrain from the consumption of oxygen to speak and spend your time listening and thinking (lost arts in our society). <br /> <br />No, this plan is not perfect, nor foolproof, but dear citizens, we are ultimately responsible for finding that perfect plan and making sure it stays perfect.Kudos to Neal and John for at least putting forth some effort at trying to find a working alternative to the present system.	2005-10-12

For years, psychologists have endeavored to offer advice and assistance to those coping with personal and professional issues. For obvious reasons, many counselors, consultants, and trainers have focused on managing stress at work. Employers want smooth operations without the potential serious consequences of stress-induced problems. Careers have been destroyed by inabilities to deal with the ongoing changes in business.  <br /> <br />I opened this book with an expectation that I might find some new secrets...perhaps a whole new approach to how workers-individually and collectively-could function much differently. What I found was another book on stress. Others may see some new ideas, but I've read a lot in this field so my expectations are probably higher than the average reader.  <br /> <br />The text is organized to explain resilience-essentially having the inner strength to cope because you're doing a good job at managing change. The authors describe this as developing hardiness, the foundation of their Hardiness Institute. The book reports on a 12-year longitudinal study of employees at Illinois Bell Telephone. The stress of all the change over the years caused the departure or failure of two-thirds of the workers. The survivors practiced effective stress management techniques. The keys they promote include approaching change as a challenge, developing sound problem-solving strategies, resolving conflicts, and building commitment.  <br /> <br />Readers will find an abundance of case studies that make points for the authors, teaching techniques and offering examples to stimulate thought.  <br />	2005-10-12

Series)	Books	5	9	9	N	N	Delicious Wordplay Here!	~ THE WORDPLAY CAFE, BY MICHAEL KLINE (REVIEW)<br /><br /> This book is lush.  Lush with wordplay.  Lush with illustrations.  The publisher, Williamson Books, put a lot of care and a lot of coin into this wonderful, refreshing splash of word games for children.  Adults will love it, too.  Such a presentation is the stuff wordplay dreams are made of!  It reflects the high energy, creativity, and fun that author/illustrator Michael Kline put into it.  The book begins with the \\"basic rules for the Wordplay Caf&eacute;.\\"  Then it discusses recipes for word games, each of which includes a short description of how to prepare the word game and a list of ingredients.  There are many word games, each using a different form or approach to wordplay.  Word Ways readers will be delighted to see the bouncy way the book casts a new, bright light on many familiar logological forms.  Word Square Snack, Acrostic Appetizers, Palindrome Potluck-let's look for a moment at that last one.  It begins with a definition of palindrome, and it includes several clear, basic examples, such as \\"A Toyota,\\" \\"Tod sees Dot,\\" \\" Step on no pets,\\" and others.  Then it suggests looking through the newspaper for palindromes, beginning with simple ones, such as \\"mom\\" and \\"pop.\\"  And then it shows the Recipe, which \\"serves 2 players,\\" and it lists the ingredients.  A section called Brain Candy gives the etymology and history of palindromes (Sotades is here).  A section called Taste Test asks \\"Can you find two palindromes in the following poem?\\" and shows a 4-line poem. Wonderfully wild watercolor cartoons accompany the text.  Some of the other sections/games include:  Add a Gram of Anagrams, Homonym Grits, Jabberwock Soup Stock, Mirror Word Macaroni & Cheese, Synonym Rolls, Word Chain Casserole, Spoonerisms You Can Eat With a Fork, and many more.  So git on in here!  Have a seat at the counter.  Take a bite.  This book is delicious.  De-lush-us.  Yum!  You'll be back for seconds, thirds, twentieths, and you'll want to bring your friends to dig your knives and forks into this delightful, brightlightful taste of just how far wordplay can go, whether you've got an empty stomach or a full brain!  The world of words is a universe of wonder, and it's all here in The Wordplay Caf&eacute;.  The kids'll love it more than McDonald's are Hardee's, and they won't bloat up in size, just in IQ.	2005-10-12

The Search is excellent and entrepreneurs will find plenty to think about, even if you are not in the technology business or could care less about search.  <br /> <br />The founders of Google approached the problem of search as academics, not as experienced search hands. Their new view of the industry gave them the competitive advantage in what was considered a mature industry.  Now the whole industry is in play again.  This isn't just a technology concept, it works in ALL existing and new industries.  Also read \\"The Medici Effect\\". <br /> <br />As an aside, I met the author's wife at a comming-out party for the book in Silicon Valley.

I don't purport to be a cross-section of America, but I have no problems getting my toddlers out of a grocery store without their Sponge-Bob cereal (my wife is a different story...she loves the stuff) and can drive by a McDonalds while ignoring the shrieks of \\"we want a happy meal!\\"       However, I am overweight.   I don't blame Kraft or McDonalds (although I wouldn't mind getting in on that cash cow once the lawsuits hit), I can perfectly well on my own decide to down the entire bag of Oreos without a 30-second ad telling me to.      Mr. Brownell's anecdotal descriptions of the effects of advertising on obesity do not create any link.   As a matter of fact (forget citation of study...but could look it up if anyone wants it) the amount of calories consumed by the average person has increased about 1% over the last 20 years, while the obesity rate has soared.   So...somehow the food industry has been plotting against my children by adding 400% more calories into that 1%?   It doesn't make sense, as do most of the arguments in the book.	2005-10-12

Once I got started, it was hard to put the book down, especially towards the end and the culmination of events. The novel is categorized science fiction, but rarely there is such a deep spiritual and philosophical theme found within this genre. The topic of the evolution of a species and its consciousness was interesting. The book isn't merely a traditional aliens-invade-the earth-the humans-must fight-them, but instead pulls out questions about our own possibilities we can open up to,  as well as our own demons we must fight. There are many different themes intertwined inside the story, some of them more scientific and concrete and some of them more mystical and imaginative, which is great combination, and keeps the feet of the story firmly on the ground while its head is in the couds.	2005-10-12

Even though this book was so highly recommended, I had trouble picking it up.  A year examining the backyard?  What?<br /><br />As soon as I started the book, through, I was hooked on the intense social lives of Holmes's crows, the eating and gathering habits of her local chipmunk, her people-wary squirrel clan (many of whom lost parts of their tails), the oh-so-important bugs, and more.  I'm not generally a reader of biology and nature books, so trust me when I say this book reaches across genres to the armchair reader.<br /><br />In fact, Holmes supports her thrilling narrative with citations from many biology books.  I can only imagine how dry these texts are, and I thank her for giving us the \\"best parts\\" in narrative form.  I learned about the navigational skills of robins and the extensive scientific studies conducted on the species, as well as the fact that hummingbirds have to learn to love the color red for its sugar, and many a baby hummingbird can be found picking at dry brown leaves and stems.  Holmes also discusses experiments that were conducted to learn how squirrels know to eat white oak acorns (which germinate before winter) and save red oak acorns (which can be stored through winter without germination).  Holmes manages to pack all this scientific information and more into a terrific narrative about a woman and her backyard.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended.  I can think of nothing else that compares, and the story of Hannah and her backyard is anything but mundane.	2005-10-12

It is written more for the higher-educated than for the common folk.  As a person who has read Kramer's 'Listening to Prozac,' I kept waiting and hoping that Kramer would clarify the changes (if any) in his thinking since his former popular, best-selling book.  Most people understand that medical studies, medical technology and medical understanding can change a person's view on some issues, but it seemed like Kramer was unable or unwilling to verbalize the possible changes in some of his beliefs since 'Listening to Prozac.\\"  I kept waiting for him to say, 'I think that now, with what we know, there are more instances that the use of antidepressants may be more beneficial to people because...\\"  But, it never happened. For first time readers of his work, the book is excellent. But, for those who have read some of Kramer's previous work, you may be left with the feeling that you just want to sit him down and outright interview him so you can ask him where he stands NOW.	2005-10-12

As an aspiring AT thru-hiker, the day-to-day journal style taught me quite a bit about what the daily grind would be like. However, the prose and the grammar just about killed me on every page. Exclamation points are used like salt, and dull, pointless paragraphs are prodigiously used to essentially say, \\"I hiked all day.\\" There was essentially no ending - even the obvious climax of ascending Mt. Katahdin is glossed over. No personal information is given, and although this might have been an intentional point by the author, it makes a lot of his adventures vague and boring - instead of knowing *who* is hiking, all we know is, as mentioned above, that he is an aging educator that enjoys hiking. And has a daughter that enjoys hiking, too.    That being said, if you are truly aspiring to thru-hike the AT, this book has some useful information. However, I would pass on it as casual reading - the \\"gee-whiz\\" style is just too saccharin.	2005-10-12

There are authors who seem to lose some spark when they write a series of books like Ms Gabaldon's. This author manages to keep the characters fresh and one looks forward to seeing their progression. I like the theme of A Breath of Snow and Ashes; the lead-up to the American Revolution is so interesting, the pivotal part of our history. I look forward to the next installment (please, Ms. Gabaldon!).<br /><br />My only thought of this book, not even a criticism, is I wish the author would refresh our memory with recurring characters as they appear. I found myself distracted by trying to remember who was who and what was what. I have read all the books, but I read a lot of books and do not remember details of past reads.<br /><br />I loved this book and the whole series!	2005-10-12

We just started a men's study on this book and I have to say, \\"wow, what a brick in the face!\\".

I would recommend this to every Christian man...period!<br /><br />I'd also like to say to the critics of this book, that the authors are in no way stating that every man is a porn addict.  What they are conveying is simply that the acts of lust are a sin and there are many degrees of lust in which a man participates in his daily life.  Certainly, they don't mean that viewing an oil painting of a nude woman is a sin unless it causes the man viewing it to lust after or fantasize over someone other than his own wife.<br /><br />We certainly have to be able to correctly interpret what we read and it appears that some don't do that as well as others.	2005-10-12

But a theory as plausible as the majority of those out there as to the identity of Jack the Ripper. <br /> <br />The book is well written and Ms. Cornwell backs up her claims with a lot of circumstantial evidence and coincidences about Sickert. But over a hundred years since the murders, what else is there but circumstantial evidence ?  <br /> <br />The detractors of Cornwell's theories can scoff at her evidence, but this does not detract from the possibility of Sickert being a stronger than average plausible suspect. And Corwell does a great job presenting her case in a fascinating manner. Alas, there will  never be a \\"smoking gun\\" found in the Ripper case, but Cornwell's presentation is as close as one will get.	2005-10-12

Large print (large enough for me). \\"Every day in your fathers word is a good day\\". To quote one of the people that helps me understand the KJV \\"It warms your fathers heart to see you reaching out to him through his letter to you the living word\\". Believe it. I prefer the KJV because 1. many churches use it (good to follow along). 2. strongs concordance(if you don't know what it is check it out. 3. Traceabilty to Hebrew / Greek (strongs etc). However, if you don't understand the linguage (heh,) take alook at the others NIV. If it does not make sense after you try it's not serving its purpose, in other words better to read the NIV than try KJV and give it up for good. As I said KJV ties to the old languages of the bible so always check the source for accuracy, and question what men's interpertations are. Look it up for yourself after instructed by man on a verse. Always use common sense. God bless.	2005-10-12

It started very slowly for me and I almost added it to the maybe someday stack.<br /><br /> If I had stopped after the first 30 or 40 pages I would probably have given it 1 or 2 stars also, but the chapter on meta tells is some of the freshest thinking on poker to come along in quite a while and very useful in the real world. It goes beyond the basic tells of Mike Caro's book but you need to have read Caro's book to fully appreciate this one. I would also agree that the writing is not as good as one would think given the author's academic background and I did find myself rereading numerous sections because of lack of flow. This is why only 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br /> One other thing, the section on meta tells is really the entire value of the book in my opinion but you need to wade through the earlier portions of the book as they lay the foundation for the meta tells section. This approach to using tells and refining them based on player personality is fascinating and useful.<br /><br /> Overall a very insightful and useable book if you can get past the slow start. Don't quit too soon and you will have some excellent new tools to add to your poker toolbox.	2005-10-12

If you're pregnant, maybe you can relate to Dena who says, \\"As I write this, I'm seven months pregnant with our second child, and I have a confession: I don't like it! I feel like a penguin in bicycle shorts!\\"<br /><br />If you're a new mom struggling with keeping up and wondering why your emotions are all wacky, you'll be blessed by Dena's tender descriptions of her postpartem depression, when she was \\"low on sleep and high on anxiety.\\" Dena says that her passion is to \\"help women see that we're in this race together.\\"<br /><br />GRACE FOR THE RACE is divided into nine sections that relate to the various stages and emotions of motherhood: training well, warming up and stretching out, the first lap, using proper equipment, hopping over the hurdles, handing it off, in the final stretch, crossing the finish line, and on the podium.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book, she quotes a prayer from Saint Frances Cabrini, \\"Give me your grace, most loving Jesus, and I will run after You to the finish line, forever. Help me, Jesus, because I want to do this with burning fervor, speedily.\\"<br /><br />Each chapter is short, a few pages of hilarious stories from Dena's personal life. And she is such a great storyteller -- I can totally relate to everything she's describing. At the end of each section, she offers \\"Notes from the Coach,\\" which are easy-to-read scriptures from modern versions of the Bible that speak right to the heart.<br /><br />I'm going to get some copies of this book to have on hand for baby shower gifts and for mom friends who I want to encourage. It's so wonderful to read something where you feel loved and accepted for who you are, yet also challenged to be the best you can be for God.<br /><br />Dena says, \\"If you're like me, you probably feel 'stuck' sometimes. Every day, I look toward the top of Mt. Laundry, having just tackled Mt. Dishes.

Watching TV, reading the newspapers, I concluded that there was a major flood in 1927 which came down the Mississippi.  Because the monied of New Orleans feared that the \\"better part of town\\" might be in danger, they arranged to dynamite the levees in such a way that would divert the waters into St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes.  Certain eminent domain and financial arrangements were made (and later reneged on) and those who could and would be were evacuated.  All the same, many died and many more would made homeless, for the potential benefit to the few.  Then, or so I heard, the outrage of the masses in Louisiana at this miscarriage of power and justice by the rich led to the election of Huey P. Long (as champion of the \\"little guy\\") as Governor and launched a career. <br /> <br />Well, too bad.  This book doesn't go down that road at all.  The flood of 1927 is barely touched on.  Yes, it happened, but there is no mention of the dynamited dams.  Yes, Hoover came down and was in charge of federal relocation and recovery.  And in the meantime, Huey was running about the same campaign he would run for the rest of his life: Down with the Rich! Up with the Poor! and All Hail Huey!   <br /> <br />Williams' biography is incredibly well documented.  You get the feeling that if you just tore out the bibliography, the notes, and the index, you would be forced to write the same book yourself, with one caveat:  some parts of the book were written from the author's notes of interviews and private communications the author had with some of the principals who were still alive when it was written through the 1950s and 60s.  The author has promised that all the notes have been archived and that while not of them can be released as yet, eventually, they all will be.  Williams is quite vigorous not so much in defense of Long as in definition of the man and his vision.  If you want to decide for yourself justwhat sort of man Huey Long was and where he might have been going, this biography is an excellent place to start.	2005-10-12

It is hard to overstate the value of this relatively short introduction to Middle Eastern history. Rather than attempting a traditional narrative, Gelvin's history emphasizes ways of conceptualizing Middle Eastern history, allowing readers to see, for example, the Constitutional Revolution in Iran and the the Young Turk Revolution in the Ottoman Empire, as part of the same general process.  This makes Gelvin's work unusually valuable for readers with some basic knowledge of the Middle East while helping newbies to understand the basic outlines of Modern Middle Eastern History without getting lost in a sea of names and dates.  Gelvin is one of the brightest and most original thinkers in Middle Eastern studies today and, even when one disagrees with him, there is an intellectual verve here that is sure to engage. <br /> <br />The weakness to Gelvin's thematic approach is that readers with limited background may sometimes feel the need to remind themselves of basic facts.  If the glossary, timeline, and biographical sketches at the end of the book do not suffice for this, William L. Cleveland's A History of the Modern Middle East would make an excellent companion volume.	2005-10-12

For example, section 2 of the book is titled \\"Skating for Power and Speed\\" and devotes one page (with pictures) to each skating skill such as Stance, Body Positioning, Skating Backward, Edge Control, Tight Turns, Corssovers, Crossunders, Pivots, Stops and Starts, Hockey Stop, Explosive Starts, Crossover Starts, Stability, and Full Extension. This is the format throughout the book with many many pages devoted to shooting, fitness, defense, goaltending, special teams. This is one of the few Hockey books that teaches player and team skills in such as way as to be not boring or overly technical.  Read a page and try the skill. It would be a great book to take to the rink and practice a few skills each time you go.  It is sort of a reference using good color pictures (I wish there were more of them).  It also has short tips from (and great pcitures of) NHL players which are a great insight into what skills were important to them as they developed.  Although the book is aimed at 9 - 12 year olds, don't be fooled. This is a serious book with great information for all ages and beginner to intermediate skill levels. it is written as to be very readable for adults and probably anyone with an interest in hockey skills and tactics. Anyone who is learning hockey should have this book.	2005-10-12

For me, The Forgotten Soldier is that book. I read a beat up battered company at the Webster Groves Library in 1980 and my understanding of the Second World War has never been the same.<br /><br />Guy Sager's narrative will keep you reading page after page. This man's experiences are so incredible, embarrassing, harrowing and heroic all at once. From a conscripted truck driver, young Sager evolves into a member of the Wehrmacht's greatest division, the Grossdeutschland Panzer Grenadier Division.<br /><br />Sager endures horrific training that seems appropriate to forging the kind of soldiers who would go on to survive Kursk, Orel, Belgorod, Operation Bagration and the agony of East Prussia. We see the war in Russia from a German perspective and begin to appreciate what it was truly like for young German men fighting not for National Socialism, but ultimately for their own survival. I believe Sager captures the one true reality of men in combat, that ultimately they are fighting for one another without any concern for the religious or political circumstances that thrust them into war.<br /><br />As other reviewers had mentioned, this book lays bare the ugly realities of war and the very real pain and suffering that accompany it. It is powerful and sobering reading that will ultimately allow you to appreicate the peaceful lives, which so many of us are priviledged to enjoy.	2005-10-12
US	12091198	RR64KM52FJ8C1	0375813748	184815754	Milkweed	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Milkweed	I love reading Jerry Spinelli's books, but resisted reading Milkweed, because of the subject matter.  The holocaust and the atrocities that were inflicted on the Jewish people were so horrendous that I hesitated, not wanting to be depressed.  The book sat at my bedside for months, before I finally picked it up to read.  What was I thinking?  This was Jerry Spinelli and he didn't let me down.  The book opens with an orphan who finds himself in Warsaw Germany trying to stay alive amongst the chaos on the streets of 1939. They call him \\"Stop! Thief!\\", \\"Gypsy\\", \\"Filthy son of Abraham\\".  Orphaned too young to remember his real name, a friend names him, Misha.  The first eleven pages paint a vidid picture of Misha running, darting around the soldiers and slipping between the jackboots.  I found myself rushing and dashing through the pages the same way Misha was doing in the book.  Milkweed is not a depressing book, in fact it is very uplifting.  Of course, you see and live the torturous times and share a tear or two with the characters, but you experience how even in the worst of times, glimmers of happiness shine through; thus the title for the book.  Even with hope waning, despair everywhere, a milkweed grows through a crack in the dirty street, symbolizing how the human spirit endures.  What I love about all of Jerry's books is how he blends the problems (usually a boy) his protagonist faces with the impish thoughts and feelings of every boy in his characters.  \\"Snips and snails, and puppy dog tails, that's what little boys are made of,\\" and Jerry never misses that aspect in his characters.  Even while writing about this dark subject, the things we love about little boys show through.  This book won the Golden Kite Award and is a great book to help children learn about that grim period of time, while inspiring them to read. - Reviewer for The Best Book Bin	2005-10-12

I loved this book; I am not what you would call a huge Jimi Hendrix fan, but being a music lover and living near Seattle, how could you not pick this title up.  <br />Charles Cross does a splendid job of retracing the youth of Jimi Hendrix, a youth that I would not wish on my worst enemies children, It becomes clear to me why Jimi was as messed up as he was. With out a stable home life and being transported from one house to another it's a wonder that he was successful at all.  <br />Jimi Hendrix was a man that wanted to do one thing and that was make music, in fact during the last week of his life when he shows up at a party without his guitar, friends knew he was in trouble. He was never away from his guitar. <br />There were some interesting I didn't know that from Jimi being in a band with Tommy Chong; yes that Chong and that one of his rodies was Lemmy from Motorhead. It also had a story of Jimi being at a Denny's in my hometown of Mount Vernon, WA although it was an accurate of not kind description of the place.  <br />This is a tragic story of a man who may have been the most talented guitarist ever, but a man who obviously was running from the demons of his childhood his whole life, these demons did make him into the greatest guitarist ever (sorry Eddie Van Halen, and Mr. Clapton) but also led to his drug use and out of control life.  <br />I came away from this book saddened and wanting more to make sure that I give my children what every child needs, a stable, loving home.	2005-10-12

Most times in the book, I felt like I was standing right next to Citation in his stall, watching the conversations around me. His races come back to life through Georgeff's words, showing the man has a deep devotion to the famous racehorse. I highly respect him of that. Eddie Aracaro, who is considered the greatest jockey of all time, was born in Cincinati, Ohio, just an hour and a half from where I am. Being the big racing enthusist I am, I was clearly humbled at the thought that 'The Master' came from little old Ohio. The famous father and son trainers Ben and Jimmy Jones were able to read horses so well, and that is portrayed through how they thought of Citation. This book was compelling and had been so thoroughly researched that it is just like taking you back to the golden days of the 1940's and 50's. I was clearly convinced that, taking the words of Ben Jones saying, \\"Anything Citation can see, he can catch!\\" I bet if Citation can see Secretariat and Man o' War, then he could whip 'em both. Best of all, this memorair portrays Citation exactly as he should be remembered: Citation was the Secretariat without television.	2005-10-12

I disagree with that reviewer. I think the author did a great job of interviewing families in all branches and including information that goes beyond one perspective. All deployments are hard and I found this book to be so helpful! My husband deployed with the Army National Guard. We are not at a base with lots of military families - we are in a regular civilian neighborhood. I found it very helpful to have this book to turn to, especially since I don't have a lot of local military resources. I got ideas for communication and helping our kids. A lot of the information is good for anyone to know - no matter what branch of service or even if you are not in the military! I also found it a helpful reminder to get certain papers in order, such as wills and powers of attorney - nice to have the checklists. <br /> <br />I heard the author speak to a group of Army Reserve and National Guard families. She has a great perspective and was very inspiring. She grew up near an Army base, was married to a Marine (who died recently) and volunteers her time to help families in all branches. <br /> <br />This book was published just before the war in Iraq. The author could not have known that so many people would be deployed for such a long time. National Guard used to have a six-month limit on deployments until 9/11 and now they can be deployed for up to 18-24 months. It is tiring to go so long in these deployments and no book is going to have all the answers, but I've found this one to be the best of any about deployment (I think I've read them all now!).  <br /> <br />Just a note to all of you who like to help other military families - this is one of the authors who is very accessible. I really liked talking with her and felt that she really cares. She shared ideas that have come up in her workshops since thisbook was published. To help families with reuniting after long (a year or more) deployments, she is writing a book on reunions. A friend of mine was interviewed for it - more info is on the survivingdeployment.com site. The author said she wants all branches again and all types of reunions - so tell your story to help others going through this hard time!! <br /> <br />I'm very thankful for all the people who took the time to write about their experiences and things they've learned. In addition to this book, I also recommend for kids Michelle Ferguson-Cohen's \\"Daddy, You're My Hero\\" and \\"When Dad's at Sea\\" by Mindy Pelton (even though it's Navy-focused, I thought it was really touching and my kids loved it). My daughter also liked writing in the \\"Deployment Journal for Kids\\" by Rachel Robertson.	2005-10-12

There are major Protestant denominations - United Methodists, Presbyterians, Southern Baptists and American Baptists, Disciples, and others - at one end of the spectrum, and the Roman Catholic church at the other end.  Many people are surprised to find that there are variations beyond these broad categories - the Anglicans and Lutherans fit uneasily between the Protestants and Catholics (and sometimes find themselves lumped in with one or the other group), and the Orthodox don't fit neatly on a two-pole continuum.<br /><br />However, beyond this broad categorisation are countless smaller entities.  Leaving aside the non-Christian religious bodies (which are also countless), there are an increasing variety of Baptists who do not belong to the major Baptist groups, Methodists outside United Methodism, Prebyterians outside the mainline denomination, several varieties of Lutherans, and more.  What is less commonly known is that there are also splinter groups and smaller jurisdictions derivative of Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism and Orthodox lines dotted all across the nation.  So unknown are these beyond their own communities that it surprises Episcopalian bishops and priests that someone might describe himself as an Anglican without being either in the Episcopal Church USA or any other national church of the Anglican Communion.<br /><br />John Plummer has undertaken an important study of this group in his study, 'The Many Paths of the Independent Sacramental Movement.'  He studies this phenomenon on several bases - doctrines, practices, and leadership history.  He doesn't develop this simply as the history of important figures nor as a simple history of ideas and liturgical development, but does a good blend of all of these methods to bring about a more full description of the situation.<br /><br />As Plummer states in his section on method, the best one can do with regard to this ever-changing group is to take a snapshot, which may or may not bear significant relation to the way the situation will look in the future.  Some groups are very small, and many are in a constant state of redefinition of their own communities that directories that have been attempted in history have been out-of-date before they were off the printing presses.<br /><br />Plummer begins with many of the standard academic works on the subject; scholars such as C.B. Moss, Henry Brandreth, and Peter Anson have had definite bias against their subject material, some examples of which Plummer demonstrates.  Other scholars such as J. Gordon Melton take a less judgemental approach, whereas figures such as Pruter and Bain are very positive in their approach to the overall subject, if not always toward the individuals and jurisdictions involved.  Plummer has also explored several smaller works and academic theses that deal with smaller issues in the episcopi vagantes and continuing Anglican areas, providing references to material that is very valuable for the researcher.<br /><br />There is a certain sense of individualism run amok in some expressions of the independent sacramental movement.  'Perhaps the anarchic confusion of the independent movement is actually a creative ferment, where valuable ecclesiastical experiments are taking place, the results of which can then be offered to the larger church.'  This confusion, however, is threatening to mainline denominations already under threat from scandals, large-scale schism and the animus that personal ego clashes can generate.<br /><br />Seeing myself as a theologian first, I immediately turned to the chapter on theology, and agree with Plummer in his analysis - 'the independent sacramental movement has not yet seen much sustained theological reflection.'  This is due in part to the fragmented nature of the community, which Plummer acknowledges.  There are no major schools, no major faculty or facilities for research, academic work or publishing, no scholarly journals or conferences that draw from a large audience, and thus far no leading light in the arena of theology from within this movement.  While the independent sacramental movement may never produce someone with the stature of Augustine, Aquinas, Luther or Wesley, there is room in this area for growth and experimentation.  There are 'areas within the independent movement where distinctive developments with theological potential, quite different from the mainstream, are happening.'<br /><br />Plummer's book is a very valuable addition to the small but growing body of work about the independent sacramental movement.  Those who call themselves Independent or Continuing Anglicans, Old Catholics, Independent Catholics, Autocephalous Orthodox, or any other such configuration (and the configurations are legion) will find a worthwhile discussion of their own historical roots.  Those outside the independent movement, both within and outside of Christianity, may find much that is fascinating, but a very real part of the larger Christian community.s for research, academic work or publishing, no scholarly journals or conferences that draw from a large audience, and thus far no leading light in the arena of theology from within this movement.

For what its worth issues #1 through #7 weren't bad. And it is to my understanding that Storm had herself and the others break away from Professor Xavier and the rest of the X-group (Gambit included), all the powers Rouge absorbed from everyone she ever touched manifest inside of her at an uncontrollable rate thus giving her the gift of invulnerability, Wolverine's claws and so on. Storm is the leader of this ragtag group consisting of Bishop - Psylocke - Neal (a new character) - Sage - and Rouge.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />They all seem to be enjoying a short reprieve from all the chaos in their lives when out of nowhere they are attacked by a bunch of armored goons who end up capturing them (Storm - Psylocke - Bishop - Beast and Neal). From there the fivesome are held captive for a short time then released into a sort of testing area where they are attacked by commandos not affiliated with whatever Spanish country they happened to be vacationing in.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />When they are dealt with, Beast and Psylocke (who are separated from the others) are attacked by a man named VARGAS. {SPOILER: Pyslocke is killed in a battle against this seemingly unbeatable foe and Beast seems quick to follow her}. From there the plot focuses on the Outcast X-men searching for Destiny's books that seemingly predict the future of the human and mutant race. The \\"LIQUID!\\" art in the book was for a while the coolest look in a comic book I had seen since reading Ultimate Spider-Man's first few issues, however, as time dragged on the art began to look like the same as pencil/inked drawings in a comic to a certain degree. And while its nice to see Bishop not worrying about the fate of the future/past, he and the new character aren't my favorite characters. Yeah most of the time the characters seem underdeveloped or just plain boring while brooding over their lives - gifts - and fates or those darned books (this occurs daily with Neal - Psylock - Beast - Rouge - and Gambit). The introduction of Gambit was probably the major downfall of the storyline overall; He was either getting the crap beat out of him or you had to hear Rouge complain about Bishop not believing he was innocent and did not kill the Viceroy. A lot of the stuff that happened in the comic seemed to be another way to distract you from the fact the X-men weren't trying too hard to find the books that Destiny left behind for them and dropped the search for more insignificant things like protecting a Mobsters daughter (a mutant with powers like Colossus) and son (a normal human who got a crush on Storm) or said otherwise. Not that this was all bad.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />In fact most of the time a break from all the talk about the books and Mystique and Destiny's difficulty with them was a nice breather of air, however, the other goings on seemed a bit little to linear to read through. I skiped through most of the unimportant dialogue that usually came from Neal or Rouge's complaints. The villains like Vargas and Lady Mastermind among others, were interesting to boot, but their few appearances and other agendas made me wonder what they were trying to gain through all of this besides those books (via Vargas). I really don't like the fact that they Brought back Psylocke from the dead -- things like this would fly in Dragon Ball/Z but not in things like X-men--- I mean it really cheapens the fact that she \\"died fighting\\" their enemy, and her friends were mourning over her. Not to mention she lost her Tattoo in the process: Talk about cheesy. All in all its not a bad comic book so far, I'll have to read the rest of the series in the other trade paperbacks available.

However, this was an engaging (if somewhat dark) and well-written mystery.  True, it could have contained a few more likeable characters (ok, a single likeable character) and the plot twists made it perhaps unnecessarily complex, but I enjoyed this book.  The writing style is a little more dense than we're accustomed to in modern fiction, but I don't hold that against Rice.  In fact, after reading the sloppy eighth-grade drivel that passes for writing today, it was a welcome change.  I'll definitely read Rice's other novels.	2005-10-12

It is right up Sterling's alley-the individual against the state, and his right to revolt.<br /><br />Of course this book has elements of other dystopian literature:  big government and small humans, retrograde technology, and state control of life, liberty, and sex.  This seems like a rehash of the usual works (\\"The Iron Heel,\\" \\"THX-1138,\\" \\"Logan's Run, \\" \\"Harrison Bergeron\\"), but keep in mind it was written in 1937, five years AFTER \\"Brave New World,\\" and  eleven years BEFORE \\"1984.\\"<br /><br />In fact, this book in many ways surpasses Orwell's classic.  Being a novella, it is crisper, punchier, and more to the point. It has less deadwood (the sex scene are allusions), and focuses on the moral aspects of an omnipresent state that has eliminated the word \\"We.\\"<br /><br />That is the key. Eleven years before Appleforth refused to eliminate the word \\"God,\\" the World Council had eliminated the word \\"I.\\"  For day to day activity, that is like removing the letter \\"e.\\"  Throughout the narrative, which is written in first person, Equality 7-2521  keeps referring to himself as \\"we.\\"<br /><br />This makes for awkward reading, since we do not know if he is along or with Liberty 5-3000, or anyone else. But that is point: the objective of the World Council is to eliminate the concept of individuality in order to cement control over society.<br /><br />You do not need a whole Newspeak dictionary if you can eliminate this one word for the vocabulary. This one small change makes all the difference.<br /><br />*<br /><br />The only drawback is that Peikoff included the galley prints of Rand's revision of the First Edition. This uselessly doubles the size of the book, but it is an important insight for fans of Rand and those who are aspiring writers.  If you liked \\"Romantic Manifesto\\" and \\"The Art of Fiction,\\" buy this book. You see Rand's mind in action.	2005-10-12

He wrote a 300-page dissertation on ferruginous hawks. This book is a shorter, less-scientific version of that dissertation. <br /> <br />Ferruginous hawks are the largest hawk in North America. They are also very shy birds, so they are considered a good barometer for measuring the encroachment of man. Flying away, and abandoning a nest, if people get too close, is possible for them. The author chose to study ferruginous hawks because so little was known about them. <br /> <br />Several nests in southern Idaho and northern Utah were chosen for observation. Some nests are set up in juniper trees, only a few feet off the ground, and some are set up on the ground. Most of the observations had to be done from blinds set up a couple of hundred yards away. The nests are big, anywhere up to several feet across. The hawks, especially the chicks, have developed ways to deal with the sun beating down on their nests (there is no shade nearby). The nests in the trees are not high enough to prevent attacks by predators, especially coyotes, as the author observed one day. <br /> <br />A couple of times, while the adults were away, Powers would climb up to the nests and feed the chicks miniature transmitters. These were intended to measure their internal body temperatures. After excretion, the transmitters were not found at the base of the trees, as expected. Adult hawks pick up bones, caracsses and droppings, and deposit them several hundred yards away, so the smell will not attarct predators. For a time, there was a shortage of jackrabbits (the main food source for the hawks) in the area. Powers was interested in seeing if the hawks would make do with whatever they could find as substitutes, like snakes, rats and lizards. <br /> <br />This is a really interesting book. The author's passion for his work and \\"his\\" hawks shows through everywhere. For those interested in nature and the environment, whether actively or of the armchair variety, this is very much worth reading. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

Informative, well outlined, and with an excellent index with plenty of information for new wx programmers or people who has been using wx for awhile. <br /> <br />I had written several wxWidgets apps prior to buying the book, but have learned many new techniques to improve my newer programs and have a better understanding of how the wx API works; the docs are not always clear. <br /> <br />My only complaint is a lack of XRC information. It is barely touched upon though I find it crucial for any program requiring more than an extremely basic GUI. No one wants to integrate C++ code generated by other programs into their code-base. None of the programs are ever likely to generate code that conforms to your coding style, but with XRC, you can compile your GUI code into an array and never worry about it. <br /> <br />The one plus in XRC though was its discussion of the wxrc compiler which I hadn't known about before the book. This was a big help in removing my XRC files from my app distributions, which are problematic in cross-platform development. Now that I can compile them into my code, things are much nicer and easier. <br /> <br />If you are looking for help with XRC and XRC only, avoid this book. Otherwise, buy it quickly. You won't be disappointed.	2005-10-12

'Grassroots' by Susan Fawcett is the book we use at the community college where I work for some of our introductory reading courses.  We also use this text in our Tutoring Center to help students get up to speed for exams, reading and writing in other courses (as almost every course on campus requires proficiency in reading and writing to a good degree).<br /><br />'Grassroots' is in many ways a writing workshop in a book.  It is not a creative writing text, but rather one that sets a firm foundation from which one can go on to creative writing, technical writing, business writing, website writing, and more.<br /><br />The first chapter explores the writing process - what is one writing for?  Who is the likely or intended audience?  How should a finished paper look?  Believe it or not, it is on this last point that so many grades have risen or fallen - a paper can be wonderfully written, but if it is scribbled on scrap paper rather than typewritten and neatly printed, it may suffer in grading, just as a letter from a business will not be as well received if it has spelling errors and problems with formatting.<br /><br />The first major section looks at developing paragraphs, which is a basic building block of letters, stories, articles, essays and other kinds of writing.  This includes brainstorming, freewriting, journaling, and outlining to make sure that ideas flow in a logical pattern.<br /><br />Units 2 - 8 are essentially grammar sections, looking at the mechanics of writing.  This includes sentence structure (including avoiding sentence fragments), verbs, joining ideas together properly, being consistent across the sentences, dealing with punctuation (does that comma belong here?), and some spelling review.<br /><br />Unit 9 has a good selection of short readings that can be used to exemplify the issues presented earlier in the book.  These include writing from well-known people such as Maya Angelou, Malcolm X, Dave Barry, Amy Tan, Leo Buscaglia and others.<br /><br />The book is very colourful, with lots of user-friendly adaptations throughout the text.  There are Writers' Workshop and Writing Assignments after each unit, and many Exploring Online sections, including links to many OWL sites (OWL is the acronym for Online Writing Labs).  This text also has an appendix dedicated to ESL instruction, and there are pieces throughout the text that link to ESL instruction.<br /><br />One of the best parts of this text is the incorporation of humour.  According to Fawcett, 'Humour is a fine instructional tool.'  There are comics, classified-ad bloopers, short stories and jokes throughout the text that make the reading and writing experience more fun.<br /><br />This is a very good text.lia and others.   <br /> <br />The book is very colourful, with lots of user-friendly adaptations throughout the text.

With the excellent premise of students with the ability to see forwards or backwards in time, Tsukuba Sakura has managed to pull off an amazing feat in manga. The dialogue is laugh-out-loud funny, and sometimes it can really pull at your heartstrings.<br /><br />But it misses the mark on the third point: 3) It needs to have a good art style. \\"LotB\\" is by no means unique in its art. In fact, it looks like just about every other generic CMX manga title out there. (Ah, CMX: The world's first \\"Me too!\\" manga company.) Tsukuba Sakura obviously put together all the manga art techniques of the time, threw them in a blender, and poured them onto the page.<br /><br />But the amazing story saves it all. The book is a page-turner. If only Sakura had taken some time to develop a unique kind of technique.	2005-10-12

This book absolutely set the groundwork for the themes of a new generation.

Take this excerpt, for example, from On The Road: <br /> <br />\\"Boys & girls in America have such a sad time together; sophistication demands they submit to sex immediately without proper preliminary talk.Not courting talk - real straight talk about souls,for life is holy and every moment is precious.\\" <br /> <br />Would you expect that attitude from a child of the 60's, with \\"Free Love\\" and all?

He's not counter-culture - he and his cronies are simply a culture all their own, and Kerouac chronicled it with a pen and typewriter.  He may not have ascribed to any particularly sophisticated style in the tradition of any great Giant of literature, but he captured the essence of what happened on the road with his friend, Neal Cassady, and others, to a \\"T\\".	2005-10-12

The story is told straight, with little reflective pondering or self-reflection, which I found unusual and even more distressing because of it. Most memoirs I have read are heavily doused in rationalizations about the author's life, indulgent in their explanations or at least lengthy in their self-interpretation. Nguyen's voice is much clearer, almost factual. In the recall of his childhood as an Amerasian child in the newly Communist Viet Nam of the 1970's, he spares details neither on the pettiness of bureaucracy, on brutal family betrayal, nor on his own actions. If anything, he glosses over his own psychological torment and emphasizes the physical and social torments he and his family endured, leaving the reader to judge for himself how these events should be interpreted. <br /> <br />I am lucky to have visited Vietnam in the late 90's and stayed in households there while researching for a documentary being made about an extended family. There are hundreds of thousands of stories like Nguyen's, varying in degrees  of severity. I have heard some of these myself and seen the evidence of ruined lives and a ruined country. Those who tried to escape, Amerasian and just plain tormented Vietnamese alike, endured tales of suffering that once heard, you hope with all your heart you will never have to hear again in this world. Human cruelty exists. In extremes.

Retailers Welcome Panel's Rejection of National Sales Tax <br />2005-10-11 <br /> <br />PRNewswire <br /> <br />WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 /PRNewswire/ -- The National Retail Federation welcomed today's decision by the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform to reject proposals to replace the federal income tax system with a controversial National Retail Sales Tax.  <br /> <br />\\"This is a major victory for the American consumers and workers who would have suffered under a national sales tax,\\" NRF Vice President and Tax Counsel Rachelle Bernstein said. \\"Consumer spending has been the backbone of the U.S. economy in recent years, and the huge new tax that was proposed would have sent a message to consumers to stop spending. The implications of that would have had devastating results for every job behind every product on the shelf. Our nation's tax system needs work, but a national sales tax isn't the answer and we're glad the Advisory Panel has agreed.\\"  <br />   <br />   <br /> <br /> <br />\\"The Advisory Panel reached some of the same conclusions that we came to a long time ago,\\" Bernstein said. \\"A National Retail Sales Tax would be extremely regressive, it would require astronomically high tax rates and there would be tax evasion like we've never seen before. Some people call it the Fair Tax but we call it the Unfair Tax.\\"  <br /> <br />\\"Now that a National Retail Sales Tax has been rejected, it's important that the Advisory Panel realize that other consumption taxes are just as bad,\\" Bernstein said.  <br /> <br />The Advisory Panel, established by President Bush in January, heard from a number of economists and tax experts during a series of hearings this spring. The panel is scheduled to submit its recommendations to Treasury Secretary John Snow by November 1, and met today to discuss what options to include in that report.  <br /> <br />Chairman Connie Mack said at this morning's meeting that panel members had come to a consensus that an NRST would not be recommended in the report. Mack said panel members were concerned that the sales tax rate it would take to replace current income tax revenue -- estimated by the Treasury Department at 22-27 percent -- was too high and would also encourage high levels of tax evasion.  <br /> <br />Mack said the panel was also concerned that the NRST would be highly regressive. Even at the 22-27 percent rate, it would triple taxes for the lowest 20 percent of wage earners. High income taxpayers, meanwhile, would pay less because invested and unspent income would escape taxation. Under a \\"prebate\\" program intended to ease the impact on low-income families and thereby address the problem of regressivity, a 34-49 percent national sales tax rate would be required, according to the Treasury Department.  <br /> <br />Rather than continuing to require income tax returns to determine who is low income, the prebate program would send checks to all taxpayers. That would amount to a $600 billion a year government transfer -- an amount larger than the current Social Security program that would require commensurate administrative costs. While the wealthy would see less of their income taxed and low-income families would have their added tax offset by the prebates, middle-income families would have a tax increase.  <br /> <br />NRF has led the retail industry's opposition to a National Retail Sales Tax, taking members of the NRF Board to the White House, meeting with the proposal's two top supporters -- Representatives Tom DeLay, R-Texas, and John Linder, R-Ga. -- and educating Congress on the devastating impact the plan would have on the nation's economy. A study commissioned by NRF in 2000 found that a national sales tax would bring a three-year decline in the economy, a four-year decline in employment and an eight-year decline in consumer spending. The study showed that similar results could be expected if other types of consumption taxes were enacted to replace the current system.	2005-10-12

The story of Wigglesworth's life is so inspiring that almost 60 yrs since his death his ministry of faith, holiness, and healing is still touching lives. <br />   I would highly recomend this book to anyone without hesitation.

I finally found some time to read it.<br /><br />Blending a unique life experience with years of studying the Scriptures, Rick clearly and simply explains how God desires to make us rich, not necessarily financially, but spiritually. The key is to be on the look out for the \\"pennies,\\" or blessings that He puts in our path. Many of these blessings are not these giant things that drop in our path, rather, they can only be found when you are looking for them. And part of looking for them is becoming totally and completely devoted to listening at the Saviour's feet.<br /><br />To be honest, you need to read this book twice; when you've read it once through you'll realize why. Sitting down to read it a second time, slowly and reflectively, will allow you to glean all that Amato has to offer in this delightful book.	2005-10-12

It is accessible, but does not \\"dumb down\\" discussion of the techniques.<br /><br />For example, with structural equation modeling (SEM), one wants to know how well the model does in explaining the actual data.  Keith does a nice job in laying out what the researcher would look for in making sense of the results--and assessing how well the model does.  The author's discussion of SEM in this book and in chapters/articles published elsewhere is a Godsend to those of us who see the value of the technique and need some guidance in its use.<br /><br />This would be a nice volume for advanced statistics classes and is well worth considering as a textbook in such classes.  For those who use statistics in research, this is also very useful.	2005-10-12

Here we find a Chuck P. that is at the top of his game, cynically brooding and musing on a society gone mad. <br />The story is based upon the idea of a 'culling' song, which is an African poem read to the sick and dying to kill them peacefully. Carl Streator is out to stop the poem from getting out. This is a basic description of this literary gem, but it's hard to think of words that can define it. <br />So, suffice it to say that this is almost my favorite book of all time.

One of the most enjoyable romance novels I have read in a while.  I was genuinely interested in the growth of the heroine and the hero, too.  Most of the change that Chellie goes through is prior to the begining of the narrative, but its effects are felt for the first time within the time frame of the novel.  Ash, our blond former military hero grows from a man ready to judge a book by its cover to a very convincingly in love hero.  More so than most romance novel heros I really beleived him when he declared his love.  And the way  he does it really had me turning the pages for more.  The sexual tension is very beleivable, and I am glad that Chellie is a strong enough character to really stand up for herself, as is Ash who does not dissapoint me in the end.  A man confident enough in himself to let Chellie be herself.<br /><br />I was left with a very happy feeling at the end of this book  and I am ready to look for more books by this author, in hopes they are as enjoyable.	2005-10-12

Dead West from Gigantic Graphic Novels is just such a book.  A blending of spaghetti western and zombie films...Clint Eastwood meets George Romero.<br />Produced by Rick Spears & Rob Goodridge, Dead West takes these two unique film genres and blends them together for one horrific ride.<br /><br />The story opens as a group of Native American Indians warmly welcomes the white man into their small village, only to have the white men lay claim to the lands.  The men return as raiders, killing all of the Indians except for the young son of the tribe's chief who escapes.  Move forward a number of years to the town of Lazarus on the very land stolen from the Native Americans.  That lone survivor of the raid, now a man, performs a ghoulish ritual atop the Lazarus cemetery, taking his own life and letting his blood spill over the graves.  Soon the dead claw their way out of the ground, and shuffle forth towards the town, led by the same Indian Shaman, now returned to life himself, to avenge his tribe.<br /><br />The residents of Lazarus now find themselves under attack by the undead zombies, and returning to life when they die themselves to attack their former friends and neighbors.  The survivors take refuge where they can and try to fight off the living dead as a mysterious man, looking remarkably like Clint Eastwood from one of his spaghetti westerns, comes to town in search of a man with a price on his head, and finds himself caught up in this hellish struggle with the dead.<br /><br />I am always a sucker for a good zombie story and Dead West certainly was that.  The black & white art, while not remarkable, was very reminiscent of the kind of art in the old Warren horror magazines like Creepy or Eerie back in the day.  In fact the art somewhat reminded me of Pat Boyette's work on those same magazines from the 60's and 70's.  I also like the fact that dialog was kept to a minimum as Spears and Goodridge let the visuals tell the story.  There's nothing worse than a story that gets too \\"talky\\", especially a horror story.  They have a very good handle on the zombie concept and a good flair for the dramatic as well.  A very well done story and I look forward to seeing more from this pair.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonrs and Goodridge let the visuals tell the story.

Define strategic factors, stakeholders analysis, the importance of defining strategic factors/objectives for each stakeholders group, not only for clients/customers. In this way we are going to define strategic factors for shareholdres, employees, and other stakeholders groups. This process is well known to ones familiar with Project Managament Body of Knowledge from Project Management Institute.   Readers advanced in Strategy Formulation and Performance Management might find several useful ideas. Intermediate readers can learn how to better define objectives, to design a strategy and implement it. Readers which are begginers in the subject might find a lot of interesting and new topics to explore. Nice and pleasant book, with a lot of examples from real world.    PS. In the book are several places where is written \\"if you'd like assistance... our organization has developed...\\". To say this and present the company once, it is OK. To mention it several times in the book made me feel like I'd paid for a commercial that was supposed to be free.	2005-10-12

Most of the reviews will attest to that, so I won't dwell on the brilliance and vision of the book. I'm giving it five stars and I'll even go further and say this is hands-down, easily the most amazing and rewarding book I've read in at least a decade (I haven't read his other books). I agree with the comparison that another reviewer made between Kurzweil and Bucky Fuller. I've read some of Fuller's books and heard him speak in the mid-seventies. <br /> <br />Having said that, I do want to say that I think Kurzweil's vision of exactly what this singularity will look like, his predictions about artificial intelligence becoming conscious, the spread of AI and intelligent control throughout the Universe, as well as his belief that we are alone in the Universe, to be, well, flawed. He seems to make certain \\"leaps of faith\\" which to my mind are just not supported. There are some assumptions which I feel he made a bit recklessly as well.  <br /> <br />No matter how explosive the growth of AI, there is no support for AI becoming conscious, emotional, or possessing a will. You can string all the computers of the world together and multiply their complexity and ability to simulate human thinking and behavior by any factor you want, and you still don't get consciousness. The best you get is a cyborg that is capable of perfectly mimicking human qualities. <br /> <br />I feel that there is a lot to fear about the coming singularity and I think that Kurzweil's vision of it is far too benign. There is too much dependence on the \\"wisdom\\" of the future technology we create and it's ability to self-regulate and develop and operate within ethical parameters. <br /> <br />An assumption seems to be made that the many separate areas of technological specialization that are mushrooming simultaneously will be able to be smoothly integrated. At the current rate of growth there seemsto be little time for a coordinated plan that will encompass all of it. <br /> <br />Kurzweil doesn't believe in ETI and that doesn't fit with intuition or logic. His premise that if ETI did exist it would have found us or we would have found it by now doesn't take into account many factors, some of which we can easily intuit, others we may have no knowledge of. The first one that comes to my mind is that if there is ETI in our part of the universe, there are probably laws that apply to interfering with civilizations that are at critically delicate phases of evolution such as planet Earth. There are any number of other explanations for why we haven't made contact yet...and on the other hand, maybe we have and don't know it. <br /> <br />The post-singularity vision of a universe teeming with nanotechnology and AI supported human control of everything is what I have the most trouble with. Why would we even want to do that? What makes Kurzweil think that the universe isn't already controlled by a greater Intelligence than our nanobots and our AI? <br /> <br />These and other questions have to be thought about and answered. The singularity is coming, no doubt about that, but what it will look like, how it will play out, that seems to be open to a lot of conjecture.	2005-10-12

Interestingly he had a whole collection of pipes on his desk.  The name of the spinster of the title is Cecile.  She is only twenty-eight.  She claims an intruder has been entering her apartment.  The claim is mysterious since lately her apartment has been under police watch and nothing unusual has been discovered.  Maigret goes to Cecile Pardon's flat.  He learns that Cedile is dead.  Cecile's aunt is dead, too.  Maigret feels guilty because he did not interview Cecile right away.  She was considered a nuisance, a joke, at the police station.      Madam Boynet had lived quite alone with Cecile.  One of the tenants in the building was a former lawyer from the provinces whom Maigret recognized.  The man had been involved in a case of the corruption of minors.  Cecile was killed because she knew the identity of the murderer, Maigret surmised.      A nephew is discovered to have a key to Juliette Boynet's apartment. (She was a miser, distrusting banks, but no money has been found on the premises.)  Gerard claims that Cecile had wanted him to check up on what was going on in the flat since the police couldn't ascertain the cause of the disturbance of the objects in the flat.      Feeling overwhelmed, Maigret goes to watch a movie.  Although everyone has been looking for a single murderer, it is possible there are two.  Maigret can be intolerably superior, even with his wife.  There is always in a Maigret novel a sense of claustrophobia.  This is noticeable particularly as Maigret nears a solution to the case at hand.     Finally, the money is located in a footstool in the flat.  The victim's papers have vanished and Maigret is required to work some more to solve this mystery in a very surprising manner.  The Maigret books are variable in quality.  This one is quite good.	2005-10-12

One of the issues skirted by James Goodwin's book \\"Akira Kurosawa and Intertextual Cinema\\" is the difficulty of making sense of visual meaning with the tool of language. Goodwin's attempts to diagram a deconstruction of the \\"text\\" proves cumbersome and unsatisfactory, and his \\"solutions\\" to the hinted at, but never directly addressed problem of visual meaning, are disappointing. There are valuable insights into the work of Kurosawa, but few enough, and nothing that cannot be found elsewhere in the literature.<br /><br />Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto's book \\"Kurosawa: Film Studies and Japanese Cinema\\" is, more satifyingly confrontational with the problem of visual meaning, and struggles with the problem of outmoded methodologies and critical assessments of film.<br /><br />The long and short of it is--the best book on Kurosawa is \\"Something Like an Autobiography\\" by Kurosawa himself with the authoring/translation skills of Audie Bock. Nothing will illuminate the man's work more clearly. No book on Kurosawa is more worth reading time and time again.	2005-10-12

Students who use Lucas' book are presented not simply with an excellent text for preparation and delivery of speeches, but also with a website full of information, examples and tips. While this is intended for a classroom setting (the teacher's edition comes with a lot of supplements to help enhance the learning experience for the students), those who want to learn about the mechanics and processes of public speaking on their own would not be ill served by using this text.<br /><br />There are some signature features that make this a very good text for students, both independent and classroom based. The internet connection is but one, not only the website associated with the book, but also tips on using the vast resources of the internet wisely and efficiently. There is a strong coverage of ethics, to help students avoid the problems of plagiarism (intentional and inadvertent), as well as how to listen properly (without attaching personal agenda or false meaning to interpretation). The book is very visually interesting, with colourful pages, pictures, charts, and examples of things that might be used to make speeches more interesting. The text is written with the student in mind - it is not a book by experts for experts, and thus keeps the language at a basic level without sacrificing clarity.<br /><br />The book itself is organised into broad sections: Speaking and Listening; Getting Started; Organising and Outlining; Speech Presentation; and finally Varieties of Public Speaking. There are few things that inspire more fear in many people than the prospect of having to deliver a public speech - the first chapter deals with some of this anxiety issue, as well as helping the students to understand the role of the listener (a role that most of us assume far more often than we realise). The sections on Speech Preparation cover the range from selecting the idea, understanding the audience and doing research to organising the speech from beginning to end in a logical, meaningful, and interesting manner.<br /><br />While the section on preparation might be consider by many to be the most important, the section on speech delivery is perhaps the most vital, for a good speech poorly delivered will likely not have much impact, whereas a poor speech delivered with great power can often have great influence. This section deals with issues of language, delivery, body language, personal presentation, as well as the use of visual aids (when they are and are not appropriate).<br /><br />There are different types of speeches, and these are covered in the final section. Speeches can be used to inform (like lectures), to persuade (much of political speech is like this, as are sermons), or in special occasions such as introducing people, presenting awards, accepting honours, or speeches of commemoration and memorial. There is also a section on small-group speaking - most people don't attribute the idea of `giving a speech' to speaking in board rooms, committees, etc., but this requires a special kind of rhetorical skill.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent text for coming to understand the art of public speaking from beginning to end., meaningful, and interesting manner.  <br /> <br />While the section on preparation might be consider by many to be the most important, the section on speech delivery is perhaps the most vital, for a good speech poorly delivered will likely not have much impact, whereas a poor speech delivered with great power can often have great influence.

This is really quite juvenile about a young teenager with a crush on a new singer, who is definitely different from the sedate crooners (Perry Como) and belters (Eddie Fisher) of that era.  The music changed in the Fifties from the movie music of the Thirties and Forties.  It has changed many times since and will continue to change as people's tasts in music changes.    The only thing to stay static is classical.  Jazz can be improvised, but classical stays the same.  Ballads were the country folk music before country was even country.  Most of the hillbilly about affairs and broken-hearted women came right out of the ballads.  Listen to \\"The Long Black Veil.\\"    Now, these fictitious letters from a fan to a rising star are pretty silly.  I know because I was a young teen back then, and I did not like Elvis Presley at all.  He was vulgar.  Frank Sinatra was the star of movies and music then, as was pure Pat Boone from Tennessee.  Tennessee Ernie Ford sang the hymns and something silly called 'Sixteen Tons.'  Dinah Shore had her own fashion/music show (she was the Loretta Young of country) with her old-home grace -- that was before Minnie Pearl came into being.      I had a cheap phonograph which looked like that featured on the cover.  As I recall, the turntables in radio stations were a lot different.  She relates how she took a record to one of the stations and it was being played out over the airways, but she could not hear anything in the studio.  All the deejay had to do was flip a switch and boom! the music was louder than the bass the young (and not-so-young) play in their cars to get notice.  I spent many wonderful afternoons visiting local stations to get Eddie Fisher on, as I was the president of \\"The Fisher Notes.\\"   We had a call-in \\"Relay\\" hosted by Bill Ross, a UT student from who-knows-where (I think he was a Cherokee Indian.), and as soon as you requested a certain song, it was on the air.  I would usually request \\"Sunshine Girl.\\"  Sounds good, but it was sad, about a girl who was left at the altar in the lurch.  Since I had no pretensions of ever being at the altar, it didn't bother me that she was deserted before anything ever began.    Life in the Fifties was good and innocent.  The older college kids had private parties around town where liquor was available.   I went to only one, and it was no fun.  In 1955, Patti Page was the rage (I pantomimed some of her songs on a t.v. local talent show; I remember doing \\"Allegheny Moon.\\").  Pat Boone with his white suede shoes was squeeky clean, as was Alan Ladd with his white cowboy boots in the movies.    Elvis came along and tossed his head, twisted his torso, and nothing was ever the same again.  Certainly not for this young, impressionable girl who claimed to have written letters to him.  I had a penpal in Sabadell, Spain, about that time who was amoured with Frank Sinatra recordings.  My photo was in YOUR HIT PARADE magazine, and his brother had written to me at first, then Carlos and I became long-distance friends.  He was a few years older than I and expected me to be more sophisticated than I was.  After all, how can a young girl in Knoxville, Tennessee, ever be sophisticated?  That's almost an impossibility even today.  They may dress adult, but their thinking is backward and uneducated.    Diane Thomas used this device for her first novel.  I tried to review A WOMAN OF INDEPENDENT MEANS to a literary club when I was a young matron, at the college, and it bored them to tears.  I had thought that the letters made the characters \\"human\\" when actually it was just the opposite.  Like these purportedly written by a young Elvis, who had no friends of his own and reached out to a disabled girl for solace.  He lived his stardom too fast, and it burned out.    Ms. Thomas and Dr. Aaron J. Gelber are big Elvis fans.  Thousands flock to Graceland every year in August, you'd think they'd go in January (his birthday), but I was told by a local woman that a t-shirt there costs $15.00.  For a devoted fan, it's okay to throw away money on junk; personally, I'd save and spend it on music.  There is an Elvis Museum in Pigeon Forge, and the Love Chapel in Gatlingburg, Tennessee. Music is the name of the game, and the spirit from within.  We all have it; it just comes in different flavors.	2005-10-12

We've been needing a poet like Palmer for as long as I can remember, and if he hadn't existed, it would have been necessary for one of us, or a committee, to invent him.  A poet who is comfortable with politics and sex as he is with Blanchot and Wittgenstein, and who seems to have diverted streams of Language-centered poetry into the spurting stream of spoken word and performance derived, oral-based, shamanic diagetics, Ronald Palmer has the real thing going on, and his book is the answer to a maiden's dream in more ways than one would have thought possible.<br /><br />Pages of dithyrambs, redolent of Blake, Hart Crane, Allen Ginsberg, storm up the edge of the page and tumble down the next.  There's a poem about sitting on a sizable sex toy that, like the intrusive rubber spear it celebrates, only hurts for the first four inches.  Best of all are Palmer's plays on words, which spring naturally everywhere; he sees the beauty even in the joins between, so that not only in line breaks but in syllable breaks does he find room to breathe and space to grow these astonishing vines of language, like kudzu, like sex kudzu, so intimate with your body it will make you cry out with a pleasure akin to pain.<br /><br />I wondered how the lyrics of this standout live performer would look written down and, while you miss some of his bellowing, whispering cathedral organ of voices, instead you have the time to stare these words in the face, and time to admire the firm construction and sleek lines of each poem.  It will take me awhile to understand Palmer's taxonomy of \\"logics,\\" out of which he has seemingly constructed a whole new architectronics of poetry.  But I've got time.  One final caveat: don't ask for this book thinking you're getting a MICHAEL Palmer book, for you're in for a whole different kettle of poisson.le of poisson.	2005-10-12

Supposedly the series will finally wrap up in the book after this one. Unfortunately, Knife of Dreams did not bring most of the many ongoing storylines significantly closer to resolution. <br /> <br />The book was not entirely uneventful, as a few significant events did occur within it. The ending however was not all that it could have been. Several long-awaited events seemed at times to be moving toward fruition, but then these promising storylines were once more put on hold until the next book. Some prior books in the series (such as The Fires of Heaven, and Winter's Heart) were mostly slow throughout but then redeemed themselves with spectacular endings. Knife of Dreams scatters its somewhat meager share of action throughout its length. <br /> <br />The biggest weakness of this series since Lord of Chaos has been the proliferation of point of view characters. Readers have been asked to spend too long inside the heads of characters who are unlikable, uninteresting, unimportant to the plot, and who know much less than the series' readers know. For instance, Galina Casban, the Black Ajah Aes Sedai, is again featured prominently. Her portions of the book are neither enjoyable nor informative, as is always the case with her. <br /> <br />The book also spends a significant amount of time with Tuon, the Daughter of the Nine Moons, whose beliefs regarding practically everything on this side of the Aryth Ocean are woefully off-base. Her many misconceptions are just irritating to the experienced reader. Moreover, she is annoyingly superior and immaturely violent, like almost all of Jordan's characters of late (particularly the women). <br /> <br />Jordan seems unable to grasp that overreporting in excruciating detail the doings of minor characters such as Therava and Rolan and Pevara and Dyelin is not what made his series successful. Characterization used to be his strength, specifically the concentration on about half a dozen major characters (the Emonds Fields youths, plus Min and Elayne). He seems to have shifted to focusing on events rather than people, which would be more bearable if more of the long-promised events actually occurred. Instead of action and plot substituting for character development, we get yet more foreshadowings of future action. This is a bad trade no matter whether the reader prefers plot or persons. <br /> <br />Rand, Nynaeve, and Min are given fairly short shrift in this book, especially Min. She has been reduced to the status of an observer whose role is to stand faithfully by Rand. This is less unbearable than the role of most of the other characters (especially the women), too many of whom seem to think their role is to do the exact opposite of whatever would be helpful. But it's still rather boring. <br /> <br />Nynaeve has similarly been reduced to merely being Lan's wife at times. In any case, both she and Rand are only on the scene briefly. <br /> <br />Mat and Perrin are featured somewhat more prominently than Rand is, though that is not necessarily a positive. Perrin remains consumed with rescuing his wife Faile to the exclusion of all else. This is understandable, but not particularly related to the larger plot of the book. Mat's actions too are mostly concentrated around his love interest and prophesied future wife, Tuon. Faile's parts of the book are uninteresting and trivial as always. <br /> <br />The book centers heavily on Elayne and her seemingly endless quest for the throne of Andor. Pretty much everyone involved in the Succession quarrel seems to be oblivious to the larger concerns around them, such as the imminence of the Final Battle and the fact that if reality itself crumbles, as seems to be occurring, the throne of Andor will be the least of anyone's concerns. <br /> <br />Jordan repeatedly emphasizes that unlike in \\"the stories,\\" people do not really always all fall neatly into line and all join together to battle the common enemy. Okay. Point taken. Again. We get it. Obviously it's true that people don't really put all their other concerns aside even in the midst of an epic struggle. But he goes way too far in the other direction. His characters (particularly Elayne and her compatriots) don't merely conduct their personal and political business alongside the greater struggle. They entirely ignore the Dark One, the Dragon Reborn, the unraveling of the Pattern, ghosts walking, and even buildings changing their physical form. They have room in their heads ONLY for their own immediate personal goals. I find this at least as unrealistic as the attitude that Jordan thinks he is a counterbalance to. <br /> <br />The part of the book that focused on Egwene was one of the more readable sections. It was interesting and to-the-point and actually moved one plot thread in a forward direction. It was also at times overly sadomasochistic and brutal and it dwelt too long and lovingly on female corporal punishment, but that's been the trend of Jordan's recent books. <br /> <br />Whether the next book will indeed be the series finale or not, at some point Jordan is going to need to pick up the pace and write with the goal of telling an interesting story instead of with the goal of filling pages until it's finally time to write his long-envisaged final scene. He's dragged too many minor plot threads out to the point where even when he finally makes a few very small revelations, they come about three books after everyone stopped caring. <br /> <br />Still, I give this book three stars because: it met and even exceeded my relatively low expectations after Crossroads, etc.; because of a few noteworthy events involving Egwene, the Forsaken, and/or old characters making a welcome reappearance; because boring though they were, some longstanding minor story arcs finally came to an end, hopefully setting the stage for a next book that focuses less on the trivial; and because some interesting scenes were set (such as one involving Mat and Thom) that will almost have to be played out sooner rather than later. If you've made it this far through the series, go ahead and read Knife of Dreams. It probably won't be your least-favorite book of the series.	2005-10-12

Our department selected this book before I arrived at the school in what I've gathered was a flurry of political correctness hysteria to \\"The American Pageant's\\" emphasis on white men.  Even if Murrin's book makes an effort to be more PC (sometimes to a fault) it makes the much bigger mistake of assuming that readers already have a fairly sophisticated background in American History.  I think it's interesting reading, but then again, I have a degree in history, so trying to learn how the concept of 18th century mercantilism is connected to the 19th century concept of progress all on the same page isn't really a major feat of mental gymnastics.  Most teachers in my department don't even use the book because it's too confusing for the kids.  If I could have my way, we'd just sell them all and buy something that's (gulp) a little simpler. <br /> <br />To its credit, the book has a nice website with lots of maps and images and resources - but in my memory as a high school student (which was during the age of the internet), a clear, concise textbook was a foundation of learning and more important than a nice website.

I have seriously mixed emotions about this book. First, as someone else already mentioned, there are far too many errors in text and editing for a professional publishing house. SHAME ON THEM! Doesn't anyone proofread anymore? The White House is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, not 1300! Many paragraphs make vague refernces that are never explained and tenses change from sentence to sentence. Quite annoying an shabbily done. <br /> <br />Then there is Radziwill's naivete. Did she really think Anthony's mother and Caroline Kennedy would be happy he was marrying a nobody from nowhere? That whole family thing -- particualrly on the Bouvier side -- has always been about marrying UP: politicians, men with titles, and Onassis, the richest man in the world at the time Jackie married him, who had dated her sister Lee Radziwill. (It is also what Carolyn Besette's mother did. She may have been a single mom for awhile, but her second husband had money and took her and the girls to live in  Greenwich, Connecticut.)  <br /> <br />That there is no mention of the drugs, the affairs, or the troubled marriage of John and Carolyn strikes me as understandable, but not terribly honest. But then, avoiding reality seems to be what all of them, including Carole, did for various reasons for a very long time. <br /> <br />Her writing is very good. <br /> <br />By the way, did anybody think maybe she might have mentioned that it's a little odd when all the women in the family are named Carole, Carolyn, and Caroline?

Pilzer does advocate high deductible health insurance for some people, but clearly shows you step-by-step how to analyze whether high deductible will save you money and, as Pilzer points out, Pilzer himself switched from a high deductible to a tradtional policy when high deductible was no longer the best deal for his family.  Now, to the main point, this book is absolutely amazing!  It contains priceless information on every page and hundred of \\"tips\\" that are so clear you wonder why no one ever told them before--like how to get 3 1/2 months of free COBRA coverage each time you change jobs. The chapter on Medicare, or the chapter on getting coverage for a sick child or spouse, or the chapter on long term disability, are each worth 100 times (Iiterally) the cost of this book.  I'm not an employer, but Part II of this book, how employers can give employees tax-free allowances to buy their own permanent health insurance, makes tremendous sense.  Buy this book. You will save lots of money and finally know how to get what every American deserves---permanent, safe, lifetime, affordable health insurance.  <br />	2005-10-12

I never realized the impact that properly groomed and trimmed eyebrows can do for a face until I read this book. I had never given much thought to my eyebrows other than to make sure they didn't overgrow and look ugly. However, I was never satisfied by my eyebrows and always found them lacking. It was the weak link in my made-up face. After reading this book and buying a few inexpensive supplies, I'm happy to say that I know what to do for my brows and I love the finished look my makeup now has. (And I didn't need to use stencils!)<br /><br />The information obtained in this book makes it possible for any woman to have neat, attractive eyebrows that are best shaped for her own face. Nancy Parker also advises on what to do if you have more pronounce facial features, such as widely spaced  eyes or a dominant nose. She also helps you figure out which type of eyebrow makeup will work best for your existing brows to get the look you want. (Brow powder vs. brow pencil, what color, etc.)<br /><br />Because this book reads so quickly, you'll be off and ready to do your own eyebrows before you know it. However, please take the time to you make your plan of action before you start plucking (or waxing) away - it will be so worth it! Stencils are not required.<br /><br />The b/w photos are nothing sophisticated, but they serve the point of showing the impact of what brows can do.<br /><br />After reading this book, I've never been able to look at brows the same again now that I know how much they can affect the face. I now see the brow effect in every model and magazine ad I come across.<br /><br />Beautiful Brows is a great book for the average laywoman who wants to gain knowledge on how to manage and make beautiful her own eyebrows. It's worth the modest price for a lifetime of beautiful brows.	2005-10-12

I am so excited about this book!! For anyone out there with kiddies between 12-ish months and 6 years or so who is frustrated with sleep issues ... <br />I can not recommend this book highly enough!!! IT IS WONDERFUL!!! <br /> <br />I have a toddler and a preschooler with entirely different sleep issues, and this is working for both! <br /> <br />I'm just not a 'cry-it-out' mom. I've tried once or twice out of utter desperation, but it just isn't a solution for our family. It just doesn't feel right for us.  <br /> <br />I read this book in a day (ok I was obsessed and driven by desperate fatigue LOL) and we've been following some suggestions for less than a week. Already our boys' sleep problems are improving (almost gone in fact!) & their day times are better now too! We are having fewer mood swings and 'spats' (we don't usually have full blown tantrums to begin with, but even the mini - strops that we sometimes get are gone!) They are both more settled and content, all due to new routines and better quality of sleep. I am more rested and better able to cope in the day too! <br /> <br />I'm no moron LOL - I hate being told how to do my job! I consider myself a great parent who does an amazing job ... we've simply been struggling with sleep issues for a while now, and the whole family has been tired as a result. <br /> <br />IMO, sometimes when we get so wrapped up in our own difficulties, it becomes a 'forest for the tress' situation. This book helped us get back to basics without preaching rights from wrongs. I find the whole attitude and approach straightforward, gentle and encouraging, without being condescending. <br /> <br />I guess what I'm trying to say is that it isn't 'Parenting 101 for Idiots' like some parenting self-help books can be. The advice and suggestions are simple and basic, and more importantly kind and gentle to our children! No quick-fix-child-training, more of a new perspective for the whole family. <br /> <br />It's great to get back to the basics without being made to feel an idiot for needing a little help. AND IT's WORKING!!! Our neighbours have noticed a difference already (in all of us!) and are lining up to borrow it ... I don't want to part with it though! <br />	2005-10-12

A round of editing and fact-checking would not have turned \\"Stone Cold Guilty\\" into an interesting read, but would at least have stripped out the obvious mistakes.    Ex. She compares the Peterson case to that of Jeffrey McDonald [sic]. That should be 'MacDonald'.    Then there's the run-on sentences and piled-on cliches that make no sense:    Ex. \\"At a second gathering of friends and trial watchers in San Francisco, all of whom I had met in June during my previous visit, at the scenic and spacious second floor Romeo walk-up flat in the Mission district, with its only slightly   obscured view of The City due to the tree cutters from the Tenderloin having lopped off the wrong branch, which dangled perilously over the highway for weeks by the nylon threads of a borrowed rope and an extension cord (that was promptly stolen), we discussed Amber Frey's testimony and recent news stories   appearing in the San Francisco Chronicle and the Modesto Bee.\\"     Ex. \\"There's a kind of hush among the Peterson apologists today, a kind of strained mumbling, as if struck by reluctant laryngitis. The more aggressive defenders, protected by anonymity on crime forums and chat rooms, are reaching for the withering vines of excuses that they hope will swing them across to reasonable doubt, before shredding in their sweaty grasp, sending them into the dark, oily depths of Peterson's mind.\\"    And then there's the total lack of original sources. Dillon didn't interview a single person related to the case. Not one. Her information is culled from media reports and public transcripts.    How many days did she attend the trial? One.    Save your money for any of the other books on the Peterson case. At least those went through the editing process.	2005-10-12

It covers the waterfront on the basic elements of Christianity in our tradition.  You will need to update the section on 'what our church is doing,' and the structure of the United Church of Christ yourself.  Still, it is a 'workbook' that requires that the students read their bibles, the book itself, and think.  A novel idea that hearkens back to the idea that confirmation is about both head and heart.	2005-10-12

The author repeatedly attaches motives, emotions, etc to Jobs without attribution as if he divined Jobs inner spirit. The book also seriously understates Jobs business accomplishments in terms of the growth of Apple Computers, the success of NeXT (let's remember that Jobs NeXT for $400M), and the amazing success of Pixar. Only at the end of the book, does Young casually mention that Jobs sunk $50-$60M of his personal money in Pixar before it became a success. <br /> <br />The author's basic premise is that Jobs is a con (hence the title), and that his success was stolen from Woz, Lasseter, and the brilliant engineers at NeXT. The problem is that facts don't support his hatchet-job approach. <br /> <br />If you are looking for an amateurish psychoanalysis of Steve Jobs, then this is your book.	2005-10-12

I am not a big one for listening to talks on CD and such, but I see there are several out there to choose from. There seems to be  an entire industry built around Tolle and yes, he's making money. Okay. <br /> <br />I also know that on his website, there are these pictures of him that you can actually buy, and I believe in various sizes! I think that's kind of ridiculous. As far as what one person may know of Tolle, I am sure he puts on that  \\"pious\\" and virtuous impression quite well with many or probably, the majority of people.  <br /> <br />As an ideal, Tolle speaks of getting over the ego, etc. but those pictures? The money he's making? To me, he looks like  the proverbial cat that swallowed the canary! <br /> <br />You New Agers! <br /> <br />I did hear Eckhart speak at an event, and  I definitely saw someone who's got quite an ego. Sorry. It's what I witnessed and I don't altogether buy his \\"persona\\".  These others have a right  to say what they experienced with the man and to say that they are coming from this bs about a \\"pain body \\" is  pathetic if not, presumptuous. You have an unpleasant experience. You say something--especially about a person who contributed to that so-called state, and claims he's so knowing about such things. <br /> <br />I  think there are people who are so loyal to this man, they don't want to see anything else. And that can be dangerous. <br /> <br />But I have to admit, I like this guy's work!  <br />	2005-10-12

As others have commented before, this is indeed a very, very peculiar fantasy epic.  A deliberately anti-LOTR, anti-Tolkien sort of fantasy.  It is, I feel, a philosophical meditation disguised as a fantasy novel. <br /> <br />As the author of the Kushiel novels, Ms. Carey's ability to write outstanding conventional fantasy -- with heroes and adventures and a whole lot of even more eyebrow-raising, uniquely Phedre no'Delaunay type things -- cannot be questioned.  Yet this is a novel that is missing all of these: it has no sympathetic hero, and it has no final deliverance.  After reading it, it leaves a dry and bitter taste in my mouth.  I refuse to believe this is an accident.  So many things are so diametrically opposed to her old style as well as the Tolkienist conventions that it must have been deliberate. <br /> <br />As a philosophical treatise (if you will), it can be read from many different angles.  Here I'll just concentrate on what I take to be the central point of the meditation: the role of fate/providence.  In Lord of the Rings, fate/providence plays a double role: it publicly threatens the heroes, yet secretly aids them.  The apparent power of the Dark Lord is overwhelming and the fate of defeat for the \\"good guys\\" seems certain.  Yet this is merely deception: not only the \\"good guys\\" refuse to accept such a fate (which is of course where most of the heorism comes from), but in fact in the course of their struggle against this apparent fate, all the \\"breaks\\" go their way.  At every turning point where the heroes' \\"fate\\" hangs along a knife's edge, they have one lucky \\"coincidence\\" after another, until such \\"coincidences\\" pile so high that even the heroes themselves begin to perceive that fate/providence is in fact at work to aid them to overcome insurmountable odds -- which, when one realizes the inherently uneven playing field favoring the \\"good guys,\\" in fact are not so insurmountable after all (there is even a sort of sly in-joke, I believe, to thisnear the end of Godslayer, where the battlefield literally tilts up in favor of the \\"good guys\\" to help them win the fight). <br /> <br />Here, the role of providence is presented, in a very unambiguous fashion (unlike the fleeting references in LOTR), as a prophecy uttered by the High God of the \\"good guys.\\"  The entire story consists of various parts of the prophecy, one by one, ruthlessly coming true \\"despite\\" all apparent odds against them.  One of the truly perverse pleasures (or ironic pains?) of this story is that, since it's told from the perspective of the \\"bad guys,\\" you feel each \\"lucky break\\" for the good guys not as dramatic, exhilarating elation, but as extremely painful regret -- why why oh why does everything that can possibly go wrong in fact does go wrong when it matters the most?  Why can't \\"we\\" get just ONE lucky break? <br /> <br />But Ms. Carey's twist on fate/providence goes beyond merely a mirror trick.  Time and time again, people do things to fulfill the various parts of the prophecy, even when they cannot understand why.  Some of these actions, so lacking in apparent rationality (or even down right irrational), boarder on grotesque parodies of heroism.  This can be clearly seen in the quest of the \\"holy water\\" -- two apparently weak people, against all apparent odds, delivering a dangerous weapon to the heart of the lands of the Dark Lord -- a storyline that most obviously parallels LOTR's Frodo and Sam.  But unlike the intrepid hobbits who display a full range of emotions and initiatives, this story's heroes are merely wooden puppets in the hands of fate.  Why should they help the High God Haomane in fulfilling his prophecy?  It was Haomane who drove them into the desert and forgot about them.  Why should they go on this quest?  It was merely at the asking of Haomane's emissary -- even when he offers no reward, and if they do not go on this quest, it will bring no harm to their society.  Why should they repeatedly make the choices that favor Haomane and his \\"good\\" allies?  Merely because they have \\"chosen\\" to do so, for no good reason.  Indeed, their whole community's constant refrain is just the command \\"Choose,\\" even when most of this community faced their potential executioners, who would almost certainly have spared them if they had offered even the slightest rational defense, or just a plea of mercy.  Instead they offer the perverse \\"Choose\\" -- asking the executioners to choose to kill them or not with no attempt at defense or explanation.  Far from \\"choosing\\" their own fate, they in fact abandon themselves to fate. <br /> <br />This is certainly not unique.  Time and time again we see characters in this novel abandon themselves to the prophecy/fate/providence for reasons are often to the utter bafflement of themselves.  In fact the whole story itself is brought to a bitter climax when two principle characters in effect committe suicide, while giving the explicit explanation of either relieving the burden of individual, rational choice or to fulfill an even greater fate/providence.  Time and time again, some of the dialogues actually read almost like a third-person observer commenting on the story, speculating the roles the various actors fill in the whole history/myth-as-a-play, and how implicitly individual choices and autonomous actions are mere illusions. <br /> <br />Above all, the feeling I got at the end is the sheer futility of human agency in the face of the overwhelming ruthlessness of providence.  There is really no joy at all in victory, or even the hunger for revenge in defeat: everything is foretold, prophesized, ordained to the nth power.  The foremost feeling is utter despair at the hands of fate. <br /> <br />To be sure, this is no exhilarating, melodramataic and happy reading material!  Another Kushiel clone it certainly is not.  As a straightforward fantasy/adventure novel, I cannot in good conscious recommend it.  But if one is willing to take a walk on the wild side a bit,give this very peculiar and strange philosophical fantasy a try. <br /> <br />BTW, it's also interesting to speculate -- this part is indeed resting on very thin ice -- about some theological implications of this novel vis-a-vis LOTR.  Tolkien is well-known as a devout Christian, yet LOTR is ostensibly a pagan novel: no savior God, no grand judgment, and certainly plenty good ol' fashioned pagan philosophy (especially in war -- reminiscent of the Iliad, where heroes achieve immortality by dying bravely and famously on battlefelds).  But fundamentally it's tentalizingly Christian in at least two respects.  One is the subtle hints about how fate/providence assists the good at every turn (Gandalf, who certainly benefits from it, comments on this more than once).  The other is the timeline: LOTR speaks of the passing of different ages in a linear timeline.  Though it has only beginning but no visible end, it certainly does not subscribe to the notion of \\"cycles.\\"  In yet another interesting twist (at least it seems to me), Godslayer turns this around too: it's Christianity-like notion of providence is hammered to home at the readers again and again (while showing the very, very dark side of such providence), but this providence nevertheless is fitted inside a fundamentally pagan notion of cyclical times, where nothing truly ever ends.  Plus, the jab about how the high god Haomane is an \\"absent father\\" is more than a little suggestive...	2005-10-12

I listened to an unabridged version of this at the gym. First, the plot is lame. Second, the writing is so lazy that it is disgraceful. I have *bruises* from the clichs. At times, I broke into laughter--just because the words were so absurd, it was hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that this man was likely paid (handsomely) to write all of this nonsense. The writing was so predictable that I could finish many sentences and the repetitive use of superlatives was annoying. Third, he needs to work on his \\"bad guys\\". No respectable bad guy needs to plead to be taken seriously or to lay out elaborate threats over and over again--if you cross a real bad guy, no one needs to tell you how that is going to work out for you--you already know. Either a character has credibility as a menace or he doesn't--a bad guy emerges more from his actions, not by *convincing* people that he is dangerous in some sort of debate format, with rebuttals and extended discussion. Fourth, I don't recognize Alex Cross anymore. I don't like him and more importantly, I don't care what happens to him. I don't like how he was so arrogant and critical when interacting with other law enforcement types. In earlier novels, he seemed more like a human being, and less like some kind of two dimensional character on a sitcom. The old Alex Cross would think the new one was a jerk, and unprofessional, and he would be right.	2005-10-12

Stelzer, Ph.D.   <br /> <br />Michael A. Stelzer, Ph.D., gives an impressively detailed look at the equivalence between the thermal system of equations and the variables of circuit theory.   He uses this similarity, together with SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuits Emphasis), to accurately model heat flow with traditional methods in electrical engineering.  Originally Dr. Stelzer's thesis, the book details the computational complexity of heat flow and why an electrical analogue to the thermal system improves the efficiency and computational speed of the solutions.   <br /> <br />The work also successfully carries out the following tasks:  (a) Demonstrates that clear differences exist in the results of simulated heat flow between pure samples and those containing defects and/or cracks.  (b) Identifies the parameters that can best carry information on the defects.  (Dr. Stelzer points out these are time-delays and magnitudes of the local temperature in response to a laser-generated heat span.) (c) Shows a test example of a SPICE-based method for irrefutable demonstration.   Additionally, the research points out that an error of less than 5% exists between the SPICE results and those of an exact thermal solution.  Packed with over 80 figures and tables, the book thoroughly verifies Dr. Stelzers' ideas and conclusions.  <br />About the Author <br />Michael A. Stelzer, Ph.D., is a three time author, a champion competitor in martial arts, and a distinguished engineer.  He received a doctorate in electrical engineering in June 2005.

The good news is numerous plot lines advance and the writing shows the effect of a full editing cycle.  The bad news is that the good writing here oddly illuminates how much of a hole author Robert Jordan dug for himself with the mess of the previous novels - with it being made very clear even a writer of his talent probably won't be able to resolve the plethora of details even with another couple of books.  I take a star off for letting a number of details and characters slip along with another half star for a pace that at times returns to near-plodding, but I'll round it up from 3.5 stars to four for the progress here that makes me have high hopes for the next book.    It is outright scary to think of how many top selling authors have come and gone since Jordan started this series.  In 1990, Lemony Snicket was a sophomore in college, J. K. Rowling had just taken that fateful train ride back to London, and most of the top sellers on the sci-fi/fantasy lists hadn't been published even in fan magazines.  My rating here is standalone and does not reflect my frustration with how Jordan has dragged this out; read my reviews of Crossroads and New Spring if you doubt that.  (Incidentally, Jordan claims to never have read a review on Amazon, having stated that \\"if you're going to get your heart checked out, would you go to a doctor (professional reviewer) or walk up to a guy on the street?\\"  Oh well.)    Although not spectacular, Knife of Dreams finally gives hope again.  Without spoiling things, many plotlines raised in the last few books advance.  Perrin's attempts to recover Faile, Mat's escape with and courtship of Tuon, Elayne's struggle for her crown, and a few miscellaneous issues resolve.  More significantly and more satisfyingly, Jordan really does make progress on some plotlines that have been promised since the first few books - Egwene's struggle to truly be the Amyrlin Seat, the implications of Lan as Aan'allein, and miraculously, even some movement on the long (1995!) dormant Eel- and Aelfinn plotline.  There are also some remarkable new point-of-view (Tuon, Loial!) perspectives that add to the details of the world without having to write hundreds of pages.  Finally, the book also shows the effort of being at Tor for more than a month before publication like the last four or five novels; Jordan isn't allowed to go off into tangents - and thankfully, no major new characters get introduced - and in general the writing is generally crisper.    Unfortunately, it's not enough.  Jordan has created so many irrelevant plotlines and characters from the sixth book onwards that even with a workmanlike effort to clean up here the mess is still very much present.  A glaring result is that the main plot - what the Dragon Reborn is doing - not only receives merely cursory attention but also doesn't show up until Chapter 18, or 385 pages into a 760 page book.  The not-particularly-engaging Windfinder and Tower-divided stories get far too much coverage without moving much, a number of major characters besides Rand (like Min, Nynaeve, and Aviendha) get very little stage time with more minor players like Galina and various Shaido characters receiving far too much, other interesting plots like the Forsaken move barely at all with minimal coverage, and of all the advancements above only the Egwene line really feels satisfying.  (If Jordan had advanced the other main characters as much as Egwene this would have been a much better book.)  The problem is clear.  The last really good WoT book, Fires of Heaven, had roughly four or five major plotlines; this has at least ten thanks to the mess of the last few books.  While Jordan and his editor state unequivocally that this will be finished in one more book (thankfully planned to be completed before any more prequels), all the new material he's added makes this doubtful and is now standing directly in the way of a great wrapup.    Jordan's goal was to have fans sweating by the end of the book; for me, I didn't get there as this doesn't qualify as a cliffhanger by any means.  Over the summer, I actually reread all the previous books and the good news is the bad ones make more sense as part of a sequential order - and at least Jordan is somewhere close to his old form, so this isn't bad.  But then again, it's not great either.  Still, it deserves 3.5 stars and is worth buying in hardcover rather than waiting.  For the first time in years, I look forward to the next novel.    September 2007: My sympathies to Jordan's lovely wife Harriet on his recent passing.  For those who are interested, the notes he left as the basis of the massive final book, A Memory of Light, will be completed and published in 3 separate books by Brandon Sanderson.	2005-10-12

In truth, essays are flexible; ever since their 'invention' by Michel de Montaigne, essays have been a rather flexible kind of writing.  However, there are some standards, and perhaps the best way to come to understand these parameters is by reading essays.  This collection of essays, edited by Joseph Mersand, is a good one.<br /><br />Mersand states his purpose as several in the introduction - to provide essays for high school and college students (as well as the general public), to demonstrate the development of the essay in English over the course of the past three hundred years, to show in particular narrative essays that tell a story without itself being a short story or work of fiction, to provide biographical information on some key literary figures, and to provide a pleasant collection for those who love reading.<br /><br />Mersand provides a one- to two-page biographical piece prior to each essay, setting the historical and cultural context of the writing.  There are some big names here - Izaak Walton, Samuel Johnson, Benjamin Franklin, Charles Dickens, Henry David Thoreau, Mark Twain, Winston Churchill, Helen Keller, James Thurber, E.B. White, and E.M. Forster, as well as dozens of other authors who were lesser known, but still great writers.  As the above list demonstrates, not all of the writers contained herein are noted primarily for their writing - Franklin and Churchill, for example, are more noted for being political figures.  However, the writing of essays is not the province of professional writers exclusively.  Such is part of the strength of essay writing.<br /><br />'The essay is well suited to convey almost any subject, point of view, or personal style,' according to Mersand.  The richness of this form is easily seen from this great collection.  If you find a copy of this book, buy it.ollection.  If you find a copy of this book, buy it. <br />	2005-10-12

If you think al Qaeda is bad news, let me introduce you to Imperial Japan, a xenophobic society of death-worshipping nationalist religious fanatics.  Leo Daugherty describes the Japanese soldier in 95 pages divided into six chapters:<br /><br />--martial tradition<br /><br />--induction and training<br /><br />--military organization<br /><br />--tactics<br /><br />--individual weapons and equipment<br /><br />--Japanese infantry division support weapons<br /><br />Want to know what motivated the Imperial Japanese soldier to hunker down in a spider hole clutching an unexploded American aircraft bomb and a hammer?  That soldier was going to blow up an American tank-and himself.  The Kamikaze came about when military defeat and lack of war material meshed with the duty of the Japanese soldier to die in battle-if necessary, by killing himself.  Daugherty wrote that the state religion of Shinto and the code of Bushido incorporated in 1867.  Emperor Hirohito was considered a god, and anything done in service to that god was good.  The national goal was unifying the world-under Japanese leadership.  The soldier's code, Senjinkun, was pounded into already-prepared recruits.  A military junta ruled Japan and this junta prepared the Japanese people for total war.  On page 21 a table lists the year-long conscript training cycle-but this wasn't the beginning of military training.  School children were indoctrinated early.  \\"By 1934, more than one-third, or 915,000, of Japan's young men in the appropriate age bracket studied and drilled at these youth training centers.\\"<br /><br />No wonder part of the Japanese Imperial Guards rebelled when Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's capitulation!<br /><br />Japan had no jungles to train in, yet the Japanese soldier was an excellent jungle fighter.  This was the result of long, thorough training.  The Japanese soldier was trained to fight at night as a means of overcoming enemy forces superior in numbers and firepower.  The bayonet and hand grenade were preferred over the rifle-especially for close combat in the dark.<br /><br />I found the descriptions of weapons and equipment brief but useful.  Many criticize the Japanese for having poor small arms, for lacking a submachine gun, for \\"over reliance\\" on the bayonet.  Actually, Japanese rifles and light machine guns were quite effective.  Japanese pistols weren't, and the Type 100 submachine gun was a failure.  The United States didn't really have a good submachine gun either, and its Browning Automatic Rifle was no match for a light machine gun.  The famed knee mortar provided close-in 50mm shellfire on enemy positions.  Oh, perhaps a semiautomatic rifle like America's M-1 Garand would have been nice-provided Japan's industry could keep her soldiers supplied with ammunition.  Unrestricted air and submarine warfare by the United States went a long way towards insuring that there was never enough ammunition for the Japanese defenders.<br /><br />At the division level (roughly 20,000 men-on paper), Japan shortchanged its soldiers on heavy weapons.  No matter-there was a decided lack of motor transport in the Japanese armed forces.  Couldn't haul artillery pieces and ammunition even if they had the hardware-a severe lack of petroleum was one reason Japan attacked the Western nations.  Against lightly-equipped Chinese formations, Japanese units had ample firepower.  When confronted by Soviet armored formations, Japan lost a chunk of Manchuria during 1939 in the Khalkyn Gol Incident.  Initially, Japan crushed more-heavily armed British Commonwealth and American troops, but by 1943 the shoe was on the other foot.  Eventually, islands such as Iwo Jima would bear the full brunt of American air power and naval gunfire unaided-it would just be the Japanese infantryman and a handful of artillery pieces buying time.  Like the Vietnamese Communists of 40 years ago and al Qaeda today, the Japanese soldier believed it was just a matter of time before the soft Americans gave up and crawled back home.  Given the disparity in divisional artillery and in tanks, this was quite the leap of faith!<br /><br />Japan declared war on the whole world and her infantrymen did more than humanly possible.  \\"Fighting Techniques of a Japanese Infantryman\\" describes in general terms how the Japanese infantry achieved this, and the tools that Japan gave its soldiers.r of time before the soft Americans gave up and crawled back home.

It is not a book for dark wiccans, etc, and the author Eileen at least states her biases. She comes from a dysfunc..(whatever.. that means..) tional family, and her opinions are seasoned with that knowledge..a knowledge and compassion that only comes (I don't care that Eileen and Cerelia only met online..) from difficulty on lifes path. Every authors biased, Eileen's FUNNY and she SAYS she's biased.But there's knowledge of the craft, and resources mentioned in her answers, and how does one of the reviewers here know that the questions are made up and not real as they come from a discussion group that both Cerilia and Holland run? Also, who CARES if they did make up some of the questions, which you can't prove. Take care, and a big hug to Both Eileen and Cerilia, Love, Vanes.	2005-10-12

He is also progenitor of ordinary language philosophy and ordinary common sense. The sensible world is restored as a first principle; something that cannot be proven, but all must concede exists. And all perception is veridical. The Inquiry captures all the nuances of the five senses as we ordinarily have come to know them. Ditto, reason, which is the focus of the first Essay. Yes, reason can lead one into infinite regress, especially when it comes to causes and effects, but we necessarily rely on some element of reason (conception, imagination, judgment) to give us bearings in the world. The final Essay is on morality. It is the least interesting, if only because Reid appeals to the \\"Author of our being\\" to establish first principles of right and wrong. Even so, humans are endowed naturally with a moral sense so that many of the appeals to God could just as easily be appeals to our endowment by human nature. But the number of his first principles is inordinate.<br /><br />One of the problems with Reid's entire approach is the number of his first principles. I stopped counting after forty. Somehow that many first principles defeats the whole notion of first principle. Even if I agree with Reid that Descartes' starting point, the thinking self, is the wrong first principle, at least Descartes starts with one first principle and deduces others. Likewise, Berkeley and Hume, one to an idealist conclusion, one to a sceptical conclusion. Reid's approach is manifestly opposite. Since he insists so much of what we are consists of numerous first principles, soon the whole notion of \\"first principle\\" loses its meaning. In a sense, to save the rest of ordinary language and common sense philosophy, he must abuse the ordinary notion of \\"first principle.\\"<br /><br />Somehow, there needs to be a better balance. Surely, that man is sentient can itself be a first principle, and that man is a rational animal can be another, and from these two, the others can be deduced. Maybe not. That's the predicament of modern philosophy.other, and from these two, the others can be deduced. Maybe not. That's the predicament of modern philosophy.	2005-10-12

Although this Gospel was never actually found, scholars surmise its existence because of over two hundred identical verses found in Matthew and Luke but not in Mark. Since most scholars don't think Matthew and Mark knew each other, this material must have come from another source, what they call the Gospel Q. Then in 1945 early Christian manuscripts were found in Nag Hammadi. Among these was the Gospel of Thomas. One third of the sayings in it were found to be similar to those in Q. This demonstrated that Q was more than a collection of quotes. It was a handbook for early Christians, or pre-Christians.   The name Q comes from the German word Quelle, meaning source. It is believed this gospel was written only a couple of decades after Jesus died, and is therefore the closest thing we have to what he actually said, a real look into the spirit of Jesus.  The editors insert commentary on the text and time to help the reader picture what the historical Jesus and the day he lived in were like. It is a fascinating little book for anyone wishing to go back to the beginnings of the Jesus tradition.

Personal Accounts of Modern Mississippi Hauntings	Books	5	6	6	N	N	The Ghosts of Ole Miss	The key word in the title of this book is \\"Modern\\" for the haunts described in this book are all of an ongoing nature. This is not to say that some of these hauntings haven't been going on for quite some time because they have been, but these are not old legends that deal with purported events that no living person has witnessed. Each and every story in this book is backed up by eyewitness testimonials and all of these ghosts were still haunting their chosen haunt. In other words, this is what all ghost books should be like.<br /><br />The author of this book is herself the owner of a haunted building and is one of those people who never believed in ghosts until she and her husband bought the building in question. Most of the people who appear in this book were just like her and didn't believe until events forced them to change their minds. Many of the witnesses in this book are the sweet little ladies who lead tours through old antebellum homes and are just not the type to make this kind of thing up. On the contrary, I would imagine that they made excuses for the disturbances for a long time before finally having to admit that they might have a ghost on their hands.<br /><br />This author does an excellent job of giving the reader the history of the location and the haunt itself without going into such detail that she looses the reader's interest. Most of each story deals with recent activity and the eyewitness accounts of the activity. She makes a particularly insightful observation in noting that some phenomena such as phantom footsteps and lights that turn off and on by themselves are common to most haunts whereas the popular idea of rattling chains and weary moans are almost never present. Over many years of reading ghost books I've noticed the same thing.<br /><br />The photographs taken by the author's husband add to the eerie feel of the book and the author has a very nice writing style. These stories aren't all that scary but they do give you a feel for the haunted location and it's spooks. This would be a terrific book for planning a nice October ghost tour of Mississippi and with this book in hand I may just do that someday.for the haunted location and it's spooks.

Many of its critics have taken the position that its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are unconstitutional.  The War on Terrorism combined with the Bush Administration's decisions regarding both the ABM Treaty and the Kyoto accords have provoked strong allegations that the Constitution's framework for foreign policy has been dismantled. <br /> <br />The author of  The Powers of War and Peace : The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11, John Yoo, is a former lawyer in the Bush Justice Department.  He argues that the Bush Administration's foreign policy has solid precedent in the actions of previous administrations. <br /> <br /> <br />Yoo points out that from the Undeclared Naval War With France in 1798 through Bill Clinton's war in Kosovo in 1999, American presidents have often prosecuted armed conflicts without formal declarations of war.  He argues that the Constitution grants different powers over foreign policy to Congress, the courts and the presidency, requiring these institutions to negotiate what the country's foreign policy is.  Yoo's argument is based on the original intent of the Founding Fathers supplemented with constitutional law and history.   <br /> <br />For instance, Yoo argues that just because a war is undeclared does not mean that it is unconstitutional.  He points out that Congress's power of the purse gives it an effective veto power over executive decisions to go to war.  He also points out that the 1973 War Powers Resolution has been systematically violated and has been treated as being de facto unconstituitional almost since the day that it was passed.  He also argues that Congressional resolutions for war are legally unnecessary and serve only a political purpose in demonstrating unity in foreign policy and war.   <br /> <br />Yoo makes a number of arguments that are bound to provoke controversy.  For instance, he argues that the Constitutionallows the government to violate international law whenever it wants to.  Yoo also holds the position that captured terrorists are not covered under the Geneva Convention since they are not combatants belonging to another country and by didnt of being terrorists did not obey the laws of war.   <br /> <br />The Powers of War and Peace : The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11 by John Yoo is an excellent work that is sure to ignite controversy and nationwide discussion/debate over these important subjects.	2005-10-12

Always in the periphery of each story is the question of how mental illness is defined and used by society as an instrument of exclusion or social conditioning.  This historical and anecdotal aspect of this book is nonetheless relevant as the horrors and indignities (degradation and abuse, rape, etc.) have continued on into our times, though with albeit increased scrutiny.  The 'use' of psychiatry for nontherapeutic ends is as horrifying as it commonplace; a variety of hair-raising studies (such as Dangerous Minds by Robin Munro) have examined its political use. I prefer individual narratives to surveys of cases--autobiographies or diaries-- in the unusual situation in which the interned woman was sufficiently lucid to be able to recount her experience.  There is admittedly almost always an element of sexual oppression and domination to these stories, as the Institution or its principals proceed to impose their agenda or themselves on the helpless victims. Narratives such as Running with the Devil by Margot Zimmermann or Writing on the Wall by Mary Elene Wood, like Geller's Women of the Asylum, are rife with material for a prurient film.	2005-10-12

It is a very useful text, and I use it when tutoring students in preparation for community college level writing and reading work. It is used at our college in the basic skills reading courses, too.<br /><br />The book looks at how writers develop their work. The first few chapters look at some of the basic mechanics of writing - planning, writing, editing and revising. It also looks briefly at certain skills needed for writing, such as brainstorming and idea generation, as well as journal writing. There are many exercises included here to give students first-hand experience.<br /><br />The second section looks at the various types of writing students will be called upon to produce - narrative papers, process papers, cause-and-effect, descriptive works, comparison-and-contrast, classification, definition, and persuasive/argumentative papers. Each chapter keeps a solid focus on the type of work presented, so that students can develop the particular skills; the final chapter in this section looks at combining the patterns, to produce more complex and comprehensive research papers and essays.<br /><br />There is a thematic listing of articles that shows the breadth of topics covered - family relationships, language, education, business and work, sports, race and culture, gender, nature and the environment, media and society, history and politics, and ethics. Among more than one hundred articles are sixteen pieces written by actual students, so that students can see the model produced by people at their same level of development. Writings from famous people such as Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King, Jr., Flannery O'Connor and Mark Twain also give breadth and interest to the selections included here.<br /><br />The writing assignments include journal writing, essays of the types modeled in the chapters, collaborative activities, and even an internet assignment. There is a companion website for students to use, and instructors can take advantage of materials provided by the publisher, such transparencies and additional samples.<br /><br />The appendix has a ten-step process for writing a research paper (one of the more common types of college writing expected of students).

This book is geared towards people who have already started working in the field: it deals with where and how to get work, what fields need translators, where to find T&I classes, useful dictionaries, professional organizations, and so on. If you've been working as a translator for awhile, you'll probably know everything in the first half of the book (though it will still be useful for the appendices).

Shamus seems to have had motive and opportunity so the police zero in on him as their #1 suspect.  Despite the hurt she has suffered from Shamus, Carmela feels it is her duty to protect him by finding the real killer.  She checks out people who might have had a problem with the victim, and finally she discovers the truth.  This book has a few loose ends and doesn't do a very good job of explaining Carmela's feelings for Shamus, but all in all, it is a pleasant read.	2005-10-12

This book is somewhere between Thompson's book (actually more of a traveling sketchbook than story) and Satrapi's tome of her youth in Iran.  As with Thompson's book, this is an outsider's view of things we may perceive as absurd (and though I believe most of what Delisle writes about is totally absurd and unbelievable, I also believe his depiction of North Korean existence under a dictator is probably very accurate).  This is an excellent beginning for Delisle and may be hard to follow.  I highly recommend the book.	2005-10-12

Books	1	37	47	N	N	A Poorly Written & Illustrated Book	I'm disappointed to see that the negative reviews of this books are largely due to concerns about the inclusiveness and diversity of this book.  Frankly, you should avoid this book primarily because it's badly written, poorly illustrated, and boring to read.  We had the misfortune of being given a copy as a gift. <br /> <br />The writer makes utterly strange analogies with the animal world in ways that make no sense and that only superficially follow the point being made.  There is no \\"plot\\" per se, and it won't hold the interest of a child or the adult reading it, especially since the \\"message\\" of the book is transmitted not with skill and grace but through beating the reader over the head with it.  The illustrations are flat and uninteresting, and the one attempt at showing physical resemblance between a grandfather and his grandchild is accomplished by the apparent fact that they both shop at Bob's House of Soviet Eyewear. <br /> <br />I'd give them the one star for effort and for trying to counter the intolerant mindset out there, but that's about all that's redeeming.  This book has taken an important, valuable message about diversity and tolerance and left it lying senseless and bleeding in a dark alley.	2005-10-12

I would like to say that I love Phillipa Gregory's books. I really do. She's a fantastic writer and researcher. But the way she portrayed Elizabeth in this novel was immensely disappointing to me. I thought her portrayal in The Queens Fool was leading to a good, non-conventional portrayal of Elizabeth. And then I read this book.      The Elizabeth in the Virgin's Lover is not all that smart. She is not self-sufficient. There is nothing in her character to suggest that she could rule a country on her own when the world was run by men. She is a weak, desperate woman who can't do anything if Robin Dudley isn't with her every minute of the day.     And Robin! Why does he have to be so power hungry? There is very little inkling in his character that he loves Elizabeth deeply, or even really cares about her beyond sex! All he cares about is being King!     Realistically I know that Robin must have had some aspirations to be king, but as a hopeless romantic I'd desperately wanted this novel to a more supportive version of the famous Elizabeth/Dudley romance. Instead it just made me feel sad and hopeless that their much celebrated relationship was anything more than a political ploy by an overly ambitious man.    That said this isn't a bad book. It's well written, well researched and well executed. I just didn't like the characters all that much.      Three stars.    Later date review update-    As I've gotten more experienced at reviewing books and knowledgeable of historical fiction and history itself I have come to the conclusion that I cannot stand Phillipa Gregory. She twists firm facts for no real reason and can't seem to make any relationship seem romantic. That said her novels that don't involve royals are a little better ( the [[ASIN:141654142X Wideacre Trilogy Box Set: Wideacre, The Favored Child, Meridon]] are actually pretty fascinating-but anything she writes about major historical figures rings very off with facts and exceptionally rigid characters-and pretty shallow storylines. However I have to admit to not reading any of her books published past 2006 ([[ASIN:0743272498 The Constant Princess (Boleyn)]]) which I had some major factual arguments with) so maybe she became a better writer. But in the end I chose to stop reading her books because I didn't enjoy them very much-and in process of dumping this author I discovered a host of novels and authors who (at least for me) represent a higher caliber of historical fiction	2005-10-12

It's how you apply what you learn.	Want to know why the conservatives and libertarians and Republicans really keep winning despite the fact that everything goes from bad to worse when they're in power? It's all about framing. They'll be proactive about making themselves look like they're the heroes while framing the opposition as the culprit. For example, in the current race for governor in VA, Republicans are testing out their plans on blaming gas taxes for rising oil prices even when it's the companies themselves that did all the gouging. And of course, there's Congress and the president who's only plan is to reward these same oil price gougers more tax cuts and frame those who prevent these tax cuts for the cronies as the villians just like they did in 2001 and after one \\"tax cut\\" package for cronies after another. Don't be surprised if Republicans carry out this plan nationwide in the 2006 Congressional midterm elections even if Democrat Tim Kaine wins the gubernatorial race in VA. <br /> <br />No doubt, blame shifting is more common with the Republicans, conservatives, and libertarians. Even now, Bush and the Republicans are doing all they can to make sure the Democrats who currently control the state and local governments in LA absorb the blame for Hurricane Katrina. What's worse is that these same people are already making it clear that rewarding no bid contracts to big business cronies like Bechtel and Halliburton, the same corporate cronies who won no-bid contracts to rebuild Iraq only to make Iraq worse and our country damaged to the point of no repair let alone reconstruction, to rebuild New Orleans for the elitists at the expense of bulldozing homes and small businesses of the working class is what constitutes spending taxpayer money wisely.  Moreover, they don't mind that lobbyists get to control the Hurricane Katrina relief panel. However, when it actually comes to helping the residents out, they're response always happens to be \\"You're on your own buddy\\" and there's no doubt that thiskind of response is the result of the \\"Strict Father Morality\\" framing of punishing whoever they feel can't help themselves while at the same time giving unlimited assistance to those who are already well off and in fact need no more corporate handouts. This of course is why corporate America, especially Walmart, will make a big deal about donating a large sum of money to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina to make the public forget that these are the same business convicts who were given total freedom from these same politicians to drive the working class off the cliff before and after the hurricane. <br /> <br />While Lakoff describes liberals and progressives as the ones who are usually nurturant, he notes that amazingly they have abandoned the idea of nurturance while conservatives, libertarians, and Republicans are nurturant at the top level while imposing \\"strict father morality\\" everywhere else including the working class that voted them into office in the first place. What's amazing is that the Democrats and progressives do very little to fight back. Instead of putting themselves on the defensive by simply reacting to sound bites or even worse just giving up and playing rollover to the Republicans, libertarians, and conservatives, Democrats and progressives will have to build their own infrastructure, think tanks, organizations, etc ... Lakoff notes that even while there are very few progressive and/or liberal think tanks and organizations, most of them are built in a totally self-defeating manner because there is no ideological unity between them. Moreover, unlike the rightwing think tanks, there is no self-nurturance or attractive purposes built into them other than posing as helping the poor which any organization can invent as an excuse. <br /> <br />If you want to avoid being manipulated by the Republicans, libertarians, and conservatives, take at the very least a few minutes every day to read this book and learn why they're controlling you despite their failed policies. Moreover, learn to fight back the Republicans, conservatives, and libertarians with your own frame of thoughts.	2005-10-12

The author calls on a series of rather good case studies to argue the point - for example the way the public punished Thiokol in the sharemarket long before the cause of the Challenger explosion had even been established. (And without any influence from insider trading.) How does the collective gut instinct get this kind of thing so right? And how does the Hollywood Stock Exchange HSX pick tomorrow's hit movies so accurately - before these films ever get released? I'm sure a few movie moguls would kill to have such an accurate track record as the \\"mindless public.\\"<br /><br />Surowiecki sets out a number of conditions that facilitate the wisdom of crowds, and explains why sometimes the public doesn't get things so right.<br /><br />I'm far from the only market researcher who has reviewed this book, and from a professional point of view the volume counterbalances a lot of argument we hear about how the public, or public polls get things \\"so wrong, so often.\\" In essence the book offers a vote of confidence in the common-sense of the public.<br /><br />However let's not ignore that there are counter-arguments to Surowiecki's case, and I wasn't satisfied that the author had explored these ideas. For example I've read scientific journals that suggest that group-decisions are usually smarter than individual decisions purely because a group has a greater chance of containing at least one expert within its ranks - but this idea isn't raised or argued here.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book I had a palpable sense that the author had run out of energy: the main points, and Surowiecki's characteristic vitality are evident more in the first half.<br /><br />I give the volume four stars though. The Wisdom of Crowds forms an important part of the jigsaw of understanding how today's networked, internetted society really functions. I enjoyed this book immensely.

In order to have such a dialogue, an electric shock was given to the \\"client\\" in order to dislodge the spirit, who was then allowed to \\"control\\" Mrs. Wickland for a certain period of time (she became like a surrogate body to these spirits).  Mr. Wicland then began a series of questions in an effort to determine who the spirit was, and why they were obsessing that particular patient - or for that matter, why they were obsessing at all...<br /><br />Also included in this book are hefty discussions on skepticism, religion & atheism - all generally interesting, but sometimes a bit wordy.<br /><br />The one thing I did not like about \\"The Gateway\\" was the author's tendency to put down other people's beliefs.  It appeared that if other's received info. that was counter to what he had received, then his view was that the other person's info. was given by an ignorant spirit, and so he was \\"right\\".  I found this amusing considering the fact that he dealt with what he called \\"ignorant spirits\\" on a daily basis - as these are the ones that tend to obsess - yet he felt that the info. he received, or what he surmised from this info., was somehow of a higher level than what anyone else could receive.<br /><br />The author also had a tendency to put down religion, and those who believe in religion - regardless of what that religion may be.  This tendency may offend some readers.<br /><br />Overall, I have given this book 4 stars because, even though I disagree with some of Wickland's conclusions, and the overall sense of his views are that his are superior, this book does provide a wealth of information for the spiritual student to ponder, and it's written in such a way that it's easy to understand & interesting.  Plus, there aren't many spiritual books out there of this length and comprehensivness where one could say that they agree with everything that was written - that's just par for the course...<br /><br />It's my belief that all books of a spiritual nature have something to offer - but it's like the blind trying to describe an elephant - your experience depends on where you're \\"standing\\" at the time & what you're feeling.

When I was 25, I suffered such severe back pain that after trying all the usual things (physical therapy, cortisone shots, TENS units, chiropractors, etc.), I convinced my orthopedic doctor to perform a spinal fusion.  Less than 2 years later, the pain returned and I was faced with a second surgery.  As I was contemplating this 2nd surgery and on massive doses of pain killers daily, I stumbled upon Dr. Sarno and his book \\"Healing Back Pain.\\"  I read this book and within 30 days, I was off my pain killers completely and living pain free.  That was over 13 years ago and I haven't taken a single pain killer since, not even ibuprofen.  Since then, my back pain has returned periodically but I have managed it with stress reduction, exercise/yoga and dealing with my emotions, as Dr. Sarno suggests.  Within days, my back pain disappears and I resume my routine and my life.  A few years ago, I experienced pain in both my wrists, leaving me to question whether or not I had carpel tunnel syndrome.  Despite many, many suggestions that I see a doctor for my CTS, I again bucked modern medicine and followed Dr. Sarno's theories and suggestions.  And, voila! my wrist pain disappeared and hasn't returned since.  I swear by Dr. Sarno, his theories and his cures.  After all, all I need to do is look in the mirror to see proof that they work.  Simply invest fully in Dr. Sarno theories and solutions, and you WILL be cured.	2005-10-12

Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a wonderfully written piece of English Literature, full of well-developed and lovable characters.  The characteristics of Darcy, including his integrity, and his powerful love for Lizzy, as well as Lizzy's intelligence and frankness, are just some examples of what makes the original so wonderful.  This book does a good job of butchering these qualities, as well as many other ideas reflected in the original.  Darcy is a sex-crazed sicko, who \\"lost it\\" to a Pemberley maid in his teens (also frequented by Wickham), and may or may not have fathered an illegitimate son.  The Fitzwilliam Darcy we know and love would,  never have done this and to suggest so totally contradicts his character in the original.  Likewise, Lizzy becomes a shy, equally sex-obsessed Mistress of Pemberley, who appears to have lost most, if not all, of her spunkiness that makes her character one of the most lovable in the history of British Literature.  Bingley's affair and bastard son is absolutey absurd, as is Georgianna'a behavior. <br /> <br />Although writing a novel is an achievement and I have a certain (although, very small in this case) level of respect for anyone who can do it, this book, set in Georgian England, is full of modern \\"drama\\" that only seems to complicate the novel and make the plot that much more ridiculous.  Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if it was set in a \\"modern period,\\" but, somehow, I doubt it. It's an insult to Austen, so save your money.	2005-10-12

If you've not bought this yet, you haven't started looking. It is that good.<br /><br />Richard Bolles is the expert. His books sell because they are fresh each year with insight, purpose and ideas for determining what job you should do, and how to get it.<br /><br />I used \\"Parachute\\" to get my first job. It continues to influence me today, as I job hunt again. (post script: two weeks after posting this review, I landed a position as a communications manager at a major firm).<br /><br />Thoroughly practical, Bolles asks you questions about your mission in life. His belief is that just getting a job -- even ones you are good at -- won't be a wise decision in the long haul. He helps you see your passions mixed with skills and experience, and guides you to getting their. Though it is hardly a self-help book, it is far more useful than the ones clogging up the Top 10 list.<br /><br />He keeps you accountable. Finding a job is your job if that's what you say you want. And if you aren't working, he won't let you make excuses -- you've got the time. Either you are looking or you aren't. Dr. Phil could take a note from Bolles' direct yet congenial style.<br /><br />Don't bother with the hardcover. You need the paperback.

Temporal procesing. Consciousness.  Subject these areas to orderely analysis and the neurl correlates of consciousness are vaguely hoving into view.  This essentially is the strategy pursued in the book. Since the visual cortex has received an enormous amount of scrutiny, the book has a rich stream of theory and result to draw upon.  Secondly, the connection between visual processing and attention has long been noted in early infant development - joint attention being a developmental milestone.  A range of studies of various brain insults have indicated that impaired temporal processing affects the unity of report self-awareness.  So far the book is on the winning track. However, when it comes to grounding consciousness the evidence is much thinner.  There is a still a huge amount about the brain we simply do not understand, e.g. from what kind of computational model (if any) is appropriate to the function and organisation of large ranges of nuclei.  Koch has shielded himself somehat by sticking with largely established results.  There is an amount of question-begging nevertheless.  Overall the latter fifty pages focus on the NCC idenitifcation probelsm and in line with our lack of knowledge, the coverage is patchy. One naggign question that is not addressed is whether consciousness is the 'same' for everyone? For example, research into autism, congential blindness and congenital deafness has revealed that the world of people and self are apprehended differently. It would have been interesting to have Koch's views on the 'consciousness' of the impaired mind - or impaired brain.<br /><br />While I found the book intersting to read I was not very satisfied at the end of it.  A savannah of philosophical questions are simply overlooked.  Secondly, many paragraphs and arguments are prefixed with the phrase 'Francis and I...'  This was entirely unnecesary and suggested either grandiosity or else a thinness of argument that needed the heft of the fame of a historical figure to get it through the door. It would be very intersting to read another edition of this book where more weight was given to the philosophical and computational conundrums that accompany eliminativist thinking.  Despite these reservations, it is a book worth musing over.of a historical figure to get it through the door.

The persons he points to are teachers and students. Not all the teachers are adults and not all the learners are children. Compiler Holmes highlights what the heart of a teacher can provide the student...nurturing, example, strength, love, inspiration, wisdom, encouragement, compassion.  <br /> <br />You will recognize the names of some of the story tellers. There are others whose names you have not seen before. All of them offer heart felt experiences. They changed lives in very positive ways...one life at a time. We are each called to touch the lives of those we meet each day. We never know how a word, action or even a smile can impact one person's day, one person's life. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful gift for teachers. But don't stop there. Anyone who cares about others will appreciate the lessons shared by each story teller. This is a great gift book for teens, young adults, and adults at any stage in life. It is a book the family can enjoy reading together...one story at a time. <br /> <br />Take the lesson from each story and begin a new day for yourself with its wisdom.

Rather long historical accounts of each place are included, along with many illustrations and photos. Although this paperback issue came out in 1981, it is the same as the original edition of 1974; most of the contemporary photos of these ghosts, most taken by Miller, since they are already over 30 years old, might indicate relics that have disappeared since then.<br /><br />One major fault of the book is the absence of maps; only one appears (on the back cover) and it's not very useful. A second fault is that Miller rarely tells you exactly where these towns were located; anyone actually in the field interested in going to these spots would not get much help from Miller's book. Therefore, I have to say the book seems more for those armchair explorers who wouldn't be interested in visiting the ghost towns discussed. The book is interesting in its historical accounts, but not a good guide for the hands-on enthusiast.	2005-10-12

As he states in the books Afterword, this is his only novel in the Acion/suspence/romance genre.  Actually I thought it was trying to be in the same genre of most of James Patterson books.  The probem I found with the book was that it developed too slowly.  We have the same unanswered questions on page 360 as we had in the beginning.  It's not until the book has as few as 50 pages left does it really get going.  Descriptions of mundane activities is fine.  It ads color and depth to the charactors but I thought it was excessive here.  They got out of the cab, went to the museaum, checked into a hotel, made a phone call, blah blah blah.  Thankfully the whole story gets turned around and it reallly has a stunning conclusion, but it was hard for me to get there.

I had heard of 'Ferberizing' your child and Detachment parenting, and when put this way, of course you wouldn't want to do such a thing to your precious baby.  I consider myself to be a strong advocate of attachment parenting and had looked to Dr. Sear's books numerous times for advice about sleeping.  My 4 month old spent his first 4 mounths sleeping in his co-sleeper in my room or in my bed with me and my husband.  This arrangement was working well for us the first few months and I really enjoyed having him close by and being able to easily breastfeed him throughout the night.  I kept expecting his intervals for sleeping to gradually lengthen, for him to wake less often and not need to feed 4-5 times throughout the night.   My husband kept telling me that coworkers were telling him that we would have to let the baby cry it out and I felt very annoyed with their advice and assumptions.  We (I) decided that we would keep things as they were until he was 4 months old hoping that things would work themselves out.  During this time I also read Healthy Sleep Happy Baby and found the advice (especially about naps and tired cues) to be somewhat helpful though I thought the book was extremely poorly written.   <br /> <br />When my son was 4 months old our situation had not improved. I was up with him constantly throughtout the night and had reached an entirely new level of exhaustion!  A co-worker of mine, who is also a Therapist, loaned me this book and I decided to read it over.  I was pleasantly surprised to find well organized information about sleep patterns as well as workable solutions for addressing my son's sleep.  His theory explaining my son's crying; because he was used to my nursing and rocking him to sleep and back to sleep, was right on.  (I don't think that I would do this differently next time as this was important for our bonding and his feeling safe and attached.)  My son needed to learn to put himself back to sleep when he woke from light non-REM sleep during the middle of the night.  I wrapped my brain around viewing his cries as protests of this change in the routine, rather then his feeling abandoned.  I also did some soul searching that helped me to see that a good portion of what I was struggling with were my own needs and enjoyment of cuddling him to sleep.  (I of course still spend plenty of cuddle time with him just not at 4:30 in the morning!)  I found too that my own exhaustion was making doing things differently and getting even less sleep for a couple of nights seem like too much.  (During the day) we carefully picked a day to begin and made a very conscious decision of what we were going to do and why. We followed the schedule of checking in on our son with some modifications of the timing that felt right to us, and have seen tremendous improvements over the week since we started. <br /> <br />In summary, if you are not having difficulties with your child sleeping then consider yourself lucky and keep doing what is working for you.  If you are, you need not be a martyr for fear that letting your child do some crying means that you are practicing 'Detachment parenting' (which to me is just a put down meaning bad parent) Though I hate hearing my son cry, he is sleeping better already, is more rested and happier during the day, and greets me each morning with a big toothless grin.  Our incredible bond has not been affected and I am beginning to feel like less of a zombie! <br />Good Luck <br />	2005-10-12

In case you weren't sure, you can be happy and successful and not graduate from Harvard or Yale.  The author includes several real life anecdotes and some statistics, and takes a good look at the admissions game.  This is especially a must-read for overwrought parents and nervous students who face a lifetime of Prozac without an Ivy degree.  Mr. Mathews does justice to the many other fine schools out there, many of whom offer comparable or superior academics.  It isn't an indepth guide to particular colleges, and although Mr. Mathews offers pointers for the application process, it isn't a how-to guide for college admissions. I am puzzled, however.  This is the second time a Harvard grad informed me that Harvard isn't the ticket I think it is.  The first, an administrator of a private school, went so far as to suggest that a Harvard degree is a burden.  Yet most of the administration at this school are Ivy.  Mr. Mathews and his wife are both Harvard grads.  His daughter attended one of the most prestigious private schools in the D.C. area, and his son, one of the most elite public high schools.  So while I appreciate the reassurance that my public college degree isn't an impediment and that my public school son is on a fairly level playing field in the admissions process, I still don't quite believe it.	2005-10-12

They protect their own. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Joe's girl friend, Gail Zigman, a Vermont State Senator, is getting threatening notes. She won't tell Joe because she believes they're related to legislation she opposes. But what if they're not? <br /> <br />Then there are those secret land purchases. Farms are being bought up in a pattern. But what does the pattern mean? Some of the purchases seem legitimate and some purchases happened after accidents and fires. And all of the purchases trace back to the same real estate office run by one of the area's most reputable men. <br /> <br />Joe and his sidekick, Willie, uncover the likely arsonist and find a connection to the land purchases, but in the process someone close to the arsonist gets killed and he vows revenge on Joe Gunther. He will hurt him in the same way he was hurt--and that means someone close to Joe is at risk. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: This book has all the elements you expect in a first-rate murder mystery--several credible suspects, villains you love to hate, reluctant heroes, unplanned outcomes, and ultimately a surprise resolution.

So far the class has been high paced with lots of reading and notes to understand.  Cliffs notes AP study guide has proven quite useful in structuring my notes and understanding key concepts. It outlines the overall pictures of what is being studied so that i can keep that in mind while studying detail that may not amke alot of sense otherwise. The prectice questions at the end of each section are always helpful in reviewing information that i have learned. Last of all the way they explain the labs is very useful! Overall succeeding in this course takes alot of motivation and perseverance. One still needs a text book to fill in all the detailed information but this book is a great for organization of thought and notes and learning what to expect on the AP exam and how to handel the questions.	2005-10-12

The title could definitely use the word 'history' in it.  I certainly didn't expect a history lesson when I ordered the book. <br /> <br />While the author obviously has a grasp of his subject, I personally find the science as he describes it very hard to comprend through his writing style.  I think he should consider re-writing the book to allow laypeople to understand what the heck science he's writing about.  What is a spiral field?  How does and why does it turn?... in what directions?... give everyday examples... why do people think it turns? etc. etc.  I certainly intend to re-read the book a number of times to see if I can understand what the heck he's talking about.	2005-10-12

I've shared it with all I know who are fellow lovers of poetry, and the written word in general. I have even introduced some of my professors to Gamalinda's poetry as he is not well known (with only one published collection of poems). I have never met a person who feels differently than I do about his work and am deeply curious about those who seem to think so poorly of it. His words are carefully chosen, and his lines are perfectly broken. He is aware of form and style; movement and meaning. I am able to read this book again and again. A fellow student in a poetry class of mine said that \\"You Can Choose Your Afterlife,\\" is the closest thing she's ever seen to a perfect poem. This may not seem fantastic in and of itself, but this girl was hyper-critical of some of the most highly acclaimed \\"agreed upon\\" poetry ever written. Gamalinda encompasses so much of what contemporary poets are striving for, and he does so with ease and grace. For those who are unfamiliar with the craft and creation of poetry, this is no easy thing to accomplish. I only wish that some of the negative reviewers had spent less time hypothesizing about the results of Mr. Gamalinda's ethnicity and all that it implies, and more time focusing on this nearly perfect collection of poems.	2005-10-12

EXTREME EXPOSURE is the first book I've read by Pamela Clare. I have never been more pleased with a contemporary romance. Let's just say that if more contemporary romances out there were as well written as this one, I might never read any other Romance genre again. Pamela Clare delivers to readers a funny, fast-paced, suspensful and heart-wrenching read all in one. We get very well-developed characters, thrills, chills, lots of bedroom action and enough romance to fill up an entire lifetime.<br /><br />Kara McMillan is a dedicated investigative journalist, full-time single mom and a past heartbreak survivor. Through the well-meaning help of a good friend and coworker, she's back on the singles scene in Denver, Colorado, putting her dignity on the line once again in order to find a man. Not really wanting to be left dangling in the breeze like a worm on the hook, she's about ready to call it quits when in walks the sexiest man to ever walk the planet. That would be Senator Reece Sheridan, the consummate, the ultimate MAN. She's conducted phone interviews with him before, and he was instantly intrigued by her sexy voice. So it's no surprise when they hit it off. Thanks to her good friend abandoning her on the spot, she has to depend on the generous spirit of the senator to take her home. Poor Kara....I only wish it had been me! Readers are quickly wisked into their whirlwind relationship as Kara begins investigationg a local mining operation thanks to the tip of an anonymous source. What follows is the stuff made of political scandal legends: mystery, intrigue, murder and justice. No one can put a scandal of this magnitude to newspaper justice like Kara. She's literally a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />A gutsy journalist deserves nothing less than a hero like Reece Sheridan. I cannot say enough what a drool-worthy speciman of a man he is. What woman wouldn't want a smart, handsome, sexy dedicated lover like the senator? He falls for Kara and puts nothing less than one hundred and fifty percent of himself into their relationship. Plus, he's a politician in it literally for the good of the people! Can it get any better? Yes, it can!! He also happens to be a knight in shining armor, so read the book and see what I mean!<br /><br />Clare has actually taken the time to write a detailed story with characters that carry us through it at the speed of light. We don't just get a minor reference to the political intrigue in this one. It's more than a backdrop, it's an integral part of the book. I don't think Kara or Reece would have been such deep characters without it. Three cheers, no ten cheers for Pamela Clare's EXTREME EXPOSURE!

Because I know if Eckhart were female, that person would have never gotten such praise. We are trained to think of \\"God\\" as Male from toddler-hood. Yes, it leaves an impression as to who has spiritual \\"authority\\". That this  other person was saying Tolle is Sexist--no one seemed to bat an eyelash. \\"Clowns\\"? Hardly.

Having delved into a number of home-study language courses, I can say without hesitation that this is the best I have ever seen. The approach to learning Portuguese is extremely effective. The student is given grammar points and new vocabulary in small, easy-to-understand doses and given plenty of practice in using and internalizing them. The course also gives considerable attention to the pronunciation of Portuguese vowels, such as the difference between \\"open\\" and \\"closed\\" vowel sounds. The amount of vocabulary in the course is not great, but the student is given such a strong command of grammar and pronunciation that constructing sentences is very easy, and new vocabulary can be picked up later. There is also a Portuguese Level 2 available (for $275, but well worth it!), which deals more extensively with vocabulary and more advanced grammatical structures. It is available from Audio-Forum and 101language.com on tape and CD (but steer clear of the CD version-it is set up so there is only one track per lesson and you cannot backtrack or review! Stick with the tapes.) After only three months of studying Level 1 and a few units of Level 2, I am amazed at how much I can say in Portuguese. If you want to learn this beautiful and fun language, the FSI courses are the best investment you can make.	2005-10-12

The plot was great and this could have been a wonderful book, but the main female lead, Nicky, was TSTL (Too Stupid to Live).  Why is it that reporters, particularly female reporters, in novels lately are portrayed as soulless, self involved, arrogant creatures who will use anyone and anything to get to the top?  Even though Nicky is the target of a serial killer she uses one of the most inane lines rampant in literature and life; \\"I can take care of myself!\\"  No, you can't.  No one can take care of themselves all the time, in every situation and thinking that you can will get you killed.  It's kind of hard to believe that Nicky, a regular average woman, can go against a knife wielding serial killer and come out the winner.  Why isn't she smart enough to assume the worst and act accordingly?   This killer has her next on his list so why go running around alone ringing the dinner bell and putting everyone else in danger? <br />   She leaked information that she got from the police in a very underhanded way, completely compromised a police investigation, and used her relationship with the sheriff to snoop.  <br />     The sad truth is that because of Nicky's actions several people died brutally, including a police officer trying to protect her.  She knew this could happen but apparently other peoples lives don't matter to her. Yet, she never felt one bit of guilt, nor did anyone else mention it.  Apparently everything was acceptable if it furthered her career.   <br />	2005-10-12

Mary Childers seems to have written a completely different kind of book, in the hope that others will understand what it was like not just for her, but for any struggling welfare family.  <br /> <br />There's nothing whiny or pleading about Childers' account of her youth, yet I squirmed with discomfort reading it.  Too many children to feed and her mother produced another, with her teenaged daughter's boyfriend.  Childers as a teenager watching someone else's baby so she could earn enough money for a root canal. Did people really live that way, in America, and recently? Her voice is compelling. <br /> <br />The reason for only 4 stars is the rushed ending. Childers writes, as an adult, of forgiving her mother and believing that she had tried as hard as she could to raise her children well.   Bullbleep.  <br /> <br />That part was not convincing at all--rather, it sounded like the stuff Childers was forced to say to get people to believe she was two years older in order to get a job. My opinion is that Childers wanted us to believe in her forgiveness just as she wanted people to think she was qualified for jobs she shouldn't have to hold.  <br /> <br />And then, why was Mary so different from the rest of her family? In my experience, when a child escapes a bad family there is usually a \\"compassionate witness,\\" one adult who believes in the child and helps that child to want more. There was no such person in the book, and it is hard to believe there was none in her life.  Maybe there was more than one; in any case, no clear reason was given for why Mary Childers wanted to and was able to overcome her beginning.  <br /> <br />Just the same, it was a riveting book, one that mostly made me cringe, sometimes made me smile, and always made me think.	2005-10-12

This was the conundrum I came face to face with while reading Sujata Massey's latest Rei Shimura mystery novel, \\"The Typhoon Lover,\\" and discovered, rather to my surprise, that the answer was a resounding \\"yes.\\"    When US intelligence suspect that Takeo Kayama, head of the Kayama School of Ikebana and Rei Shimura's former lover, may have bought an antique Mesopotamian ewer that was stolen during the latest gulf war, they decide to recruit Rei in order to discover how Takeo had acquired the piece. As a friend and former lover, the feeling is that Rei should be able to get the information without setting off too many alarm bells. And while Rei is not at all sure if she's cut out for this kind of cloak and dagger stuff, or even if she could persuade Takeo in take her into his confidence (much less talk to her since they did have a rather messy breakup), the lure of being able to return to Japan (Rei was deported from Japan in \\"Samurai's Daughter), proves too much for her. And in no time at all, Rei finds herself back in her beloved Japan, and trying to reconnect with a newly engaged Takeo, who would much rather keep Rei at arm's length. And while Rei was prepared for the fact that it would take a lot of hard work in order to reestablish their friendship, what she was not prepared for, she discovers to her horror, was the resurgence of some of her old feelings for Takeo, or how her flashly blundering about would lead to tragedy...    There were many things I liked about \\"The Typhoon Lover\\" -- like the fact that it took place mostly in Japan, and that it was a very well written, suspenseful, absorbing and totally riveting novel. However certain things did niggle at me: for example, I really had to suspend my disbelief in order to buy the notion that the US secret service's best bet to figuring out if Takeo was involved in buying stolen antiques was to bring Rei into the investigation. Surely must have been a better plan out there somewhere? I like the character, Rei Shimura, but her method of operation has always been to stumble about, rather flashily, until she arrives at the truth. Subtlety and discretion have never really been her strong points. And this was the woman that US intelligence thought perfect for this particular job? I also found that I was not really enjoying this new direction that the author was taking Rei in -- esp in regards to her relationship with Hugh (her on-and-off again boyfriend), after having gone through so much with Hugh, I was disappointed that Rei felt stifled by her relationship with him, and how she handled things here. But in spite of my growing frustration with Rei, I found that I simply had to read on in order to discover what would happen next. And this, in my opinion, was the real testament to Sujata Massey's brilliant writing skills -- that she had me absolutely riveted in spite of myself. Also brilliantly done, was how the authored portrayed the tense atmosphere as everyone was hunkering down to deal with the typhoon -- I really felt the cold, wet danger of it all. And as always, I enjoyed the author's portrayals of the current trends in Japan; and in this instance, Rei's feelings of confusion at realising that she may no longer fit in with the youth culture.     In all, \\"The Typhoon Lover\\" was a very enjoyable read. In spite of my complaints, at the heart of things, this series has not changed. Rei is still the flawed but stalwart character, who still passionately throws herself into whatever task she's doing. She may stumble about with two left feet, angering people and setting off alarm bells everywhere, but she's always determined to do the right thing and see justice done. That's the Rei Shimura that's won fans everywhere and the Rei Shimura that will always be at the heart of this series, in spite of whatever direction the author takes her heroine in.	2005-10-12

Ronco has experience in the software industry so it is with personal knowledge and experience that he crafts the story of artificial intelligence and the future of the technology industry.  Ronco presents this novel as what could be a worst case scenario with software terrorism and a future where this could be an issue as serious as nuclear war.<br /><br />Dianne Morgan is the CEO for VantagePoint Software, the maker of Atlus, the most popular computer operating system in the world and one which is in nearly ninety percent of the world's computers.  This obviously brings to mind a company called Microsoft.  Morgan brought to trial by the United States government in an anti-trust lawsuit and her company is broken into smaller companies.  This is something that has happened several times in our nation's history.  Her revenge is to unleash a computer virus called Peacemaker.  Peacemaker has the capability to infect and shut down nearly every computer on the planet.  Her goal: nothing less than global domination.  The only man who can stop Peacemaker is Ray Brown, a software developer who helped make Atlus the most popular piece of software on the planet.<br /><br />The novel becomes something of a cat and mouse game as Ray stumbles across Peacemaker and learns of the scope of this virus which is so sophisticated that it is an artificial intelligence.  Dianne Morgan is preparing to unleash Peacemaker on the world and while she needs to stop Ray she also wants to convert Ray to her side since they share a past together.<br /><br />The concept behind \\"Peacemaker\\" with the ideas of software terrorism and the artificial intelligence and just the scope of the issue is fascinating and helps the reader press on through the book because I certainly wanted to know how things played out.  The problem is the writing and the characters.  The characters seem to be mainly one dimensional and Ray's inner struggles regarding his alcoholism seem somewhat childish.  The other characters are not any better and most are even more one dimensional.  Before each chapter there is a one or two quotes from a future newspaper or novel regarding some of the characters.  What this does is let the reader know a little bit how the events of this novel will play out and affect the world years down the road.  It kind of takes some of the tension out of the book.<br /><br />Ronco has a good deal of potential as an author because he has one very important gift that can't be taught: the ability to come up with a very interesting story idea.  I have no doubt that his skill as a writer will come as he continues to write.  \\"Peacemaker\\" was a very fast and easy read, but it is not without some serious flaws in the execution of the novel.

Tosches had the makings of a terrific thriller. But the central character and plot are unbelievable.   <br />  The book starts with Johnny DiPietro, nephew of an old Mafia don, fulfilling a contract for his uncle. He drives, his buddy does the shooting. To Johnny, the victim is not a person, but Johnny's \\"new transmission\\" for his car. He's a slimeball, and thus far rendered believable, ala Elmore Leonard. There is a reference that, as a youth, he had a thirst for knowledge, and that he had at one time read good books. Aside from this, Johnny gives no sense of authority, high intelligence, or competency. Then his uncle, who wants to take over the world's heroin market, decides to use Johnny as his representative in the biggest (and least plausible ) dope deal in the history of crime fiction. Suddenly Johnny, who's making twenty-five grand a year in a union job, is transformed into a wizard with the ability to: <br /> 1- Negotiate a billion dollar drug deal with a stereotyped crafty, unfathomable Chinese Triad boss <br /> 2- Has a tremendous facility with numbers <br /> 3- Is knowledgeable about international banking, finance, the Asian drug market, crops, weapons systems, customs brokerage, and much much much more ( he can do no wrong, make no false step ) <br /> 4- Is conversant with, and actively thinks about, Dante, Socrates ( whom he criticizes as arrogant for his admonition to \\"Know thyself\\", since knowing oneself is impossible), and Milton's Paradise Lost. <br />  There is no sense of irony to tell us this is all meant as parody. Rather, Toshces presents this in a serious tone, with a lot of \\"deep\\" perception from the previously thuggish Johnny, that alerts the reader to the fact that Johnny is really Tosches' representative more than his uncle's; it is the author's concerns put into Johnny's mind, and as such they become, especiallyin the penultimate chapter, more pretentious than they would have if we had been given a realistic character who was fully developed. Johnny loses all credibility, as does the preposterous plot.  <br />   Tosches is very talented. He has done abundant research. With the Chinese Triads he had a good subject that wasn't written to death. But all this was lost under the creaky, potboiler plot and the unbelievable Johnny.  <br />   Johnny tells us there is no good or evil, but tries to convince us he's a nice guy anyway. To rationalize shipping billions of dollars of heroin into New York, he says the drug addicts deserve it. \\"If the scum of humanity craved heroin, so be it. Let the self-oppressors go down together, down to the wasteland of gutted souls and assembly-line minds.\\" And he calls Socrates arrogant?	2005-10-12

All the information finally fit together.  I'd been doing acupucture for fertility for nearly a year when I read this, and I finally understood WHY.  So many women are getting swept up in the \\"trendiness\\" of doing acupuncture to help them get pregnant, and we are starting to lose touch with the WHY. You can't just lie there passively on the table with pins pricking into you and expect it to work.  In order for your body to really accept the treatment, you should know what it's doing for you! Why might you be producing low progesterone, why might you not be ovulating, how does diet change your body's receptivity to a pregnancy, and how can you treat these deficiencies.  These are all questions that were building inside me, and I had no one person to give me the answers--til this book.  It helped me understand my body better, what things were off balance, and what I could do about it. Most importantly, it helped make me a more savy consumer with both my acupuncturist and my reproductive endocrinologist.  I began asking better questions and feeling more in control during a scary and discouraging time. <br /> <br />The one challenge I could see with this book is not having an acupuncturist to talk things over with.  If you are on your own and trying to self-diagnose your infertility cause through this book, you are going to do a lot of second guessing and wondering.  But if you have an acupuncturist who you can talk to openly (I even gave a copy of this book to mine. . . he loved it!), confirm your theories with, and make a plan together, you will feel like you are treating your body from the inside out and getting closer to a pregnancy.	2005-10-12

Coetzee's tenth novel, the follow-up to his enigmatic work, \\"Elizabeth Costello\\" (2003).  And, as the subtle yet remarkably tight sentence above demonstrates, his prose-pointed as ever-retains the singularity that has propelled him to international fame, adding to, rather than detracting from, the high intellectuality and ethical attentiveness often attributed to his plots and subjects of inquiry.   <br /> <br />Paul Rayment, the subsequently \\"slow\\" man hit by an unrepentant teenage driver while riding his bike only a few miles from his home, awakes from the trauma to learn that the doctors will \\"save what we can\\", but that he will undoubtedly lose most of his leg.  A retired photographer in his later years, without immediate family or even close friends, Paul must come to terms with having not only his mobility seriously compromised, but more significantly his entire set of life circumstances altered.  And even so, he adamantly pushes this to its (seemingly) nonsensical apogee - he obstinately refuses the prosthesis that might allow him to retain some semblance of his previous life.   <br /> <br />Probing the underlying logic of his disaffection and current circumstances, Paul is forced to confront his place within the world, from which he has by choice remained largely distanced.  This comes across in painfully honest prose, as Coetzee writes: \\"The nurses are good, they are kind and cheery, but beneath their brisk efficiency he can detect - he is not wrong, he has seen it too often in the past - a final indifference to their fate.... It is as if these young people who have been assigned to care for them know they have nothing left to give to the tribe and therefore do not count.\\"  These are thoughts that can unsettle even the most self-reflective person, the most confident - an irreducibility that more often than not remains shrouded somewhere in the background, allowing us to function in the present.  What happens when we seriously entertain such notions?  Coetzee has the ability to lay bare this inglorious aspect of the human condition with an openness that most could feign match.   <br /> <br />Paul's convalescence develops into a protracted affair that spans the length of the narrative.  Falling in love with his caretaker - the married, Croatian immigrant nurse Marijana - attempting to play father and benefactor to her teenage son Drago, Paul's complicated attempt to insert himself into a meaningful narrative of self fails miserably and finds an uninvited yet insistent critic in the novelist Elizabeth Costello, protagonist of Coetzee's previous novel and foil for his ethical inquiries into the relationship between writing and life.  Though her advent remains largely unexplained to both Paul and the reader, Costello's presence further complicates Rayment's position and even implicates the reader's complacency in sympathizing completely with Paul's circumstances and actions.   <br /> <br />Such a philosophical uncertainty at the heart of Coetzee's latest novel does not function at the expense of the plot, as the two simply cannot be separated.  The clarity of Coetzee's writing and his insistence upon direct and unadorned sentences and sentiment brings forth Paul as thoroughly human, in all of his unabashed contradictions and complications.  We as readers only too willingly follow along, page by page, as Coetzee brings us to the fore in our sympathy for Paul, but not without first working through the complexity of our particular movements within a much larger dance, one that must, at some point, end.	2005-10-12

The scenery never really changed during the book which kinda made the book boring in a way, but since it was mostly conversation it also went at a decent pace. The characters in the book were quite pathetic ecept for the narrator(Jake). He seemed to have a decent head on his shoulders when he wasn't drunk. The character Brett Ashely was terrible! If a woman acted like she did now days she'd have no friends and would have to move from place to place after she was done making her rounds with all the men in town. She was a horrible drunk that couldn't make up her mind about who she wanted to be with or when she wanted to settle down. By the end of the book she was 34 dating a 17yr old spanish bull fighter and had been with every man in the book except Jake. However they did kiss a lot in the beginning and he'd always ask her to be with him and i never knew why they didn't ever settle down b/c they both claimed to \\"love\\" each other. If you love someone and are toying with the idea of settling down shouldn't you consider marrying them? This Brett chick had me going nuts through out the whole novel because one minute she'd be with one guy for a while, wind up breaking his heart and move on to the next cute guy she found. I just don't agree with that. Another thing that kinda bothered me about this book was the fact that they were always drinking. I've never heard of people that drink as much as they do, not even alcoholics. Over all I did like the book because it wasn't just in America's back yard, it took place in different countries. I never really grasped a moral or lesson out of this book. The ending was annoying in a way because it left you wondering what was next in the middle of action. I love to read those books as long as they have another one right after to explain it.  <br />-PRCHELSEAPENNY	2005-10-12

Kisa Sohma is spending more and more time at Shigure's house to see Tohru, much to another's dismay. On a chance encounter Tohru meets Hiro Sohma, a conceited young boy who delights in ordering her about. His personality is well suited for his animal sign, the ram or sheep. Hiro Sohma begins to hang about the Sohma house as well and is constantly nagging Tohru about letting people walk all over her...by walking all over her. A bit of this young tyrant's past is revealed with a decisive moment between him and Akito that leaves Kisa hospitalized.<br /><br />After a trip to the local pool Uo and Hana decide to buy Tohru a bathing suit to replace the middle school one she still wears. They recruit the Sohma boys to help them choose one. A bit of Uo's past is revealed surrounding Tohru's mother. Uo's past is gone into, her developing friendship with Tohru and her mother, Kiyoko, and her gang member days.<br /><br />The Prince Yuki fan club rears it's ugly head again. This time President Motoko is concerned about Yuki's student council presidency...because she doesn't want any women serving on the council with him. The opportunity to speak to him presents itself a few times, and she exploits these chances to the utmost.<br /><br />This is a down volume from the last amazing one, but it's still a great read.

Wealthy, beautiful, stylish and privileged, she spends most of her time trying to disguise the fact that she is one serious scholar who does not fit the mold of a 1950's woman.  Hers is a life of dicotomy, on one hand she is a slave to the fashions of the day spending copious amounts of time (and her father's  money) on being the best-dressed and most elegant young woman possible; while her internal dialogue reminds us that even the most outwardly privileged have their demons.  As other reviewers have stated the fact that this novel was written by a man speaks volumes to the author's skill in nailing a female voice.  Gloria's journey to eventual maturity is a fascinating one, and this novel provides compelling insight into a thankfully by-gone era for women.  I especially enjoyed Gloria's eventual \\"revenge\\" on her father's creepy colleague, a truly horrid character if there ever was one. 4.5 stars.	2005-10-12

Anyone who listens to contemporary Christian music has heard the song, \\"Shout to the Lord.\\" Darlene Zschech sat down at her out-of-tune piano one day and put the Psalms to music as she vowed to \\"shout to the Lord\\" in her darkest hour. <br /> <br />One of the most moving stories she shares is that of Amy Newhouse, to whom the book is dedicated. Despite taunts and jeers from classmates she maintained her commitment to Jesus and to abstinence. Though this apparently made no difference, the influence of her life became evident when she was diagnosed with cancer in 1999. You'll have to read the book to find out what happens and how God used her in a mighty way. <br /> <br />There are more than a dozen stories in this small book about how God used this song to bless, reclaim, and restore people in the midst of pain, sorrow, loss, and more. But the book is more than that. It is a call to worship, truly worship God. It is about lifting up our hearts, our minds, and our voices to celebrate that God is with us in the midst of every thing that happens in our lives. It is about celebrating the fact that everything that happens can glorify God as we lift it up to Him. <br /> <br />As the song says,  <br /> <br />\\"Shout to the Lord All the Earth, Let Us sing <br />Power and Majesty, Praise to the King <br />Mountains Bow Down and the Seas Will Roar <br />At the Sound of Your Name <br />I Sing for Joy at the Works of Your Hands <br />Forever I'll love You, Forever I'll Stand <br />Nothing Compares to the Promise I Have in You.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: This small book not only shares details of that story and what Darlene learned from it, but also reveals some of the stories of how the song has touched people's lives around the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

She kindly agreed to attempt vegan recipes for MY sake.   <br /> <br />Therefore, we went out to her local HFS and thumbed through several books there.  My friend was pleased by the overall simplicity of the recipes she read in HIAV, so she bought the whole book and we used the recipes as our shopping list. <br /> <br />HUGE mistake. <br /> <br />The banana-blueberries muffins had no taste!  The banana pancakes were heavy and gummy and bland.  I do not know if my friend will ever risk another recipe from this book.  *I* certainly wouldn't; if it were up to me I'd take the book right back to the store to get a refund! <br /> <br />Thank goodness two years ago we tried Bryanna Clark Grogan's Baked Donuts recipe, thereby proving - to my friend - that vegan baking *can* be completed successfully and deliciously.  <br /> <br />Don't make yourself crazy wondering what you did wrong; recipes in books should be tested and re-tested and written to be foolproof -- and these are not.  I've used better recipes culled from the internet!  The authors may be nice women, but they certainly aren't chefs...or even good cooks! <br /> <br />They detract from the vegan image and disappoint anyone attempting to sample the vegan experience by issuing this untrustworthy book. <br /> <br />Best best is to chuck it and instead go straight to another author.  There are so many reliable ones now that no one should have to suffer through this book.	2005-10-12

Though I certainly do not agree with everything Commander Rockwell wrote, many of his observations and conclusions, though dated by time, still appear to be valid even today.<br /><br />His concerns about the power and influence of organized and entrenched Zionism and the dangers implicit in this power and influence ring bitterly true after events such as 9/11 and the invasion of Afganistan and Iraq where American foreign policy has been increasingly hijacked by pro-Israel 'neocons'.  In addition, his warnings about the violence and degeneracy of African-American culture and behaviour can be verified by simply turning on your radio and listening to the savagery, sexuality and baseness of so-called 'rap' and 'hiphop' music as well as by examining the barbarity and sexual promiscuity still found in the inner cities of Detroit, Washington, Los Angeles and New York.<br /><br />The genius of Commander Rockwell, who gave his life for his cause and his people, is clearly evident in his warnings and prognostications for the America of the future.  Enlightened citizens should surely take them to heart.	2005-10-12

Some of the information is valid (vitamins to take, foods to eat or avoid). Other opinions are old world wive's tales i,e., menstruation is not natural. OK, I can ignore the stupid stuff (although there shouldn't be stupid stuff in a book for Black people who already suffer as medical guinea pigs). What I found and EXPERIENCED as very dangerous is one recipe in particular - on page 72 (of the revised and expanded 7th edition) under the heading \\"Anthelmentic Enemas (gets rid of worms).\\" It calls for 1-2 CUPS of salt mixed with lemon or lime juice (no amt given), with warm water (no amt given). I used 1 cup of salt with a 1/4 cup of lemon juice in a hot water bottle of warm water. I administered the enema and within 15 minutes my body went into shock. Severe pain in legs and feet, lower back and stomach with vomiting and bleeding from the rectum. I drove myself to the emergency room. I was immediately admitted. A colonoscoopy revealed that the salt and lemon juice mixture had caused perforations in my colon! Had the perforations penetrated the outer wall of my colon I could have died from peritonitis (they told me). Here I am in the hospital 3 days later and the bleeding is still an issue. I am on a bland diet awaiting a follow-up colonoscopy (in 30 days) to see if the damage has healed or left scarring. My \\"new\\" gasteroenterologist said, \\"Throw that @#%*@*! book away!\\"  I will give it back to the party who loaned it to me with red X's across the enema recipes whether they like it or not. This book has BAD INFORMATION. And in my opinion, if you only crash your car once a month, you still aren't considered a good driver on the other 29 days!	2005-10-12

I picked up David Sacks' book from Borders' Linguistics stack because of the title. I should have known better.  <br /> <br />I started the first chapter and didn't have the time or intention to finish it. The book is a collection of charts and stories about the history of alphabetic writing that are to be expected from the title -- in some cases conviniently summarized things in tables and maps -- but lacks, in my opinion, systematic thinking on the reasons behind the origin and prosperity of alphabetic writing that is found in other scholarly works (scholarly it is not).  <br /> <br />Even within the first 20 pages or so, I was disawayed more than a few times by dubious claims, utter misinformation, and distastefully Euro/English-centric. Here are some examples: <br /> <br />\\"The alphabet was not the earliest writing: Egypt, Mesopotamia, and probably China already had nonalphabetic systems. But the alphabet was the most efficient writing system ever found, before or since (p.1)\\" -- What about Hirogana for Japanese? Syllabaries can be much more efficient for languages that do not have a large inventory of syllables.  <br /> <br />\\"The 'spreadability' of an alphabet means that the future of our Roman letters looks very bright indeed. (p. 10)\\" -- He was speaking of languages that are written in multiple alphabets, such as Swahili, Serbo-Croatian, Urdu/Hindi, and Yiddish. And then came this proud comment on the prospect \\"our Roman letters\\". Immediately following the above quote, he gave examples of Azerbaijian and Tatarstan's decision to switch to Roman, as well as other \\"struggling nation\\"'s likewise decisions to \\"switch to Roman letters for native tongues, as a big to tie into global trade and communications and to better prepare their prople to learn English. Tragically, much that is venerable and spiritually sustaining while be lost. Yet that seems inevitable in the 21st century were areshaping. And it is sobering to reflect that our 26 letters wield such power.\\" <br /> <br />His view of the learnability of the alphabet is also uneducated, shall I say. The following superficial comment could have come from an old gradama who happened have NOT been a teacher for her lifetime.  <br /> <br />\\"An alphabet enjoys on huge advantage over any other writing system: It needs fewer symbols. No other sysmtem can get away with so few. This makes an alphabet easier to learn. Students need memorize only two dozen or so letters to begin building toward literacy, which typically takes about another five years of instruction\\".  <br /> <br />And -- he writes -- because of this simplicity, children can become literate before the working age. \\"This cricial fact has made the alphabet historically the vehicle of mass literacy. (p.5)\\" Well, \\"vehicle\\" is a very clevery way of framing it. At least he is not saying that where there is alphabet there is mass literacy. Mass literacy was nevery a goal before the inducstry revolution. Now Sacks joins the ranks of you-know-who's by implying that the Europeans and Western ideals were destined to take over the world because they had the alphabet and probably the mandate from God. (Guns, what guns?) <br /> <br />Sacks also compared \\"our 26 letters\\" -- as if alphabetic writing is patented at the USPO -- to Chinese. \\"Today Chinese schoolchildren normally take three years longer than Western children to learn to read and write, with most of that  <br />extra time devoted to mastering the symbols.\\"  <br /> <br />This is completely misinformation. Learning to read Chinese is not easy, but do a little research, you will find studies over studies and books over books on comparitive studies of literacy (including my own). I've nevery seen a credible study that substantiates the 3-year lag. By the way, Sacks almost never gives citations.  <br /> <br />I think that's enough. This explains my total disappointment with the book -- I sholdn't have any high expectation from the start, had I known who David Sacks is.	2005-10-12

Hearst's father George was a self-made man who made millions in the gold and silver mines of the West. He also had been a Senator from California and had founded the San Francisco Examiner. When George died, he left everything to his wife Phoebe and nothing to his only son William. William was in his late twenties when his father died, and had nothing to show for his age (he was a prep school and Harvard dropout), except for running up expenses when he worked on his father's paper. But he had big ideas and an interesting philosophy to go with them: \\"There is no shame being in debt. Debt, on the contrary, was the magic ingredient to build and buy whatever [one] wanted. A penny saved might be a penny earned, but a penny borrowed was worth even more.\\"<br /><br />With this philosophy driving him he began building his publishing empire, buying newspapers, new equipment, \\"stealing\\" writers and editors from his rivals. His mother was his early source of \\"borrowed\\" income - whatever he wanted she gave him (though she kept careful records).<br /><br />But the publishing business (which, in addition to scores of newspaper around the country, eventually would include ownership of many magazines, which proved even more lucrative) was just a stepping stone to other adventures: politics (he was a US congressman from NYC for a couple of terms and ran for governor and then President, unsuccessfully), the incredible mansions and art collections he spent millions on, and his mistress, the actress Marion Davies, whom he lived with openly for the last three decades of his life though he was still married to his wife Millicent.<br /><br />Hearst was a man of idea, though, and strong opinions, and his newspapers allowed him a platform from which to air them. He was a strong advocate for unions early on and against the trusts; he was against the US getting involved in WW I and hated Wilson; he hated communism and lashed out violently with his pen against Roosevelt's New Deal proposals (especially the NRA), which he viewed as too left-leaning; again when WW II seemed imminent, he believed the US should stay out in Europe (though he felt a strong threat from Japan).<br /><br />Nasaw is an excellent writer and recounts Hearst's life in a compelling and authoritative manner. Perhaps he spends a bit too much time on Hearst's life with Marion - it takes on a sordid quality, especially when combined with all the space devoted to the mansions, the parties in them, and the seemingly maniacal need to collect artifacts, regardless of price. But he makes it plain that Hearst was more than that, and that he influenced public opinion and was a world shaker greater than most newspaper editors even dare to dream. A fascinating book.

Sort of like Halloween without the candy.<br /><br />Here, the transfer of the Crown Colony to Red China is only a few years away. A top executive in the London HQ of the Secret Intelligence Service unilaterally reactivates Geoff Howells, a former MI6 assassin previously forced into retirement after he began enjoying his work just a little too much. Geoff's mission - to kill Simon Ng, the head of a powerful Hong Kong triad, who's understood to be threatening the Beijing mandarins with the blowing of bloody big hole in the containment dome of a nuclear reactor located six miles upwind of the colony unless Hong Kong's handover is delayed fifty years, an unacceptable scenario to the Brits, who just want to exit gracefully ASAP. To bring Simon out from behind his protective walls and bodyguards, Howells kidnaps Sophie, Ng's daughter by his beautiful English wife, Jill.<br /><br />The basic elements of HUNGRY GHOST promise a lean and mean thriller. While it proves to be gratifyingly mean, it's less of the former through the introduction of a superfluity of characters: Pat Dugan, a Senior Inspector in the Commercial Crime Unit of the Hong Kong Police Department as well as Jill's brother, Simon Ng's father and brother, two CIA operatives, one very cute female assassin working for the People's Republic, and a golden-hearted bar girl named Amy. While all these extra players add complexity and interest, I suggest the novel would have been even better had it come down to a contest between Jill and/or Sophie and Geoff without all the other distractions. Indeed, author Stephen Leather has created strong-willed heroines to excellent effect in two other of his potboilers, THE BOMBMAKER and THE STRETCH, both of which transcend this volume in suspense and clever plotting and got 5 stars from me.<br /><br />Mind you, HUNGRY GHOST's 462 paper-backed pages provided better than average entertainment on a 4-hour rail ride from Bridgeport, CT to Baltimore, and a 5-hour flight from Baltimore to Los Angeles, when I wasn't otherwise dozing.

Is she a spy - a traitor in disguise?  Could she just care for the ones in need, with sweet intentions we all see?  You decide...<br /><br />Hugh Broderick Brooks, the Earl of Rayfield (a premier spy hunter), has just finished winning his hand in a card game with his suspect Francis Treadwell. The prize just happens to be Treadwell's daughter, Charlotte.  Why would Treadwell discard his daughter so carelessly?  Are these Treadwells in this plot together, or is there something more going on here?  What is Hugh going to do with a helpless female in his midst?  What will become of poor sweet Charlotte?<br /><br />Ms. Laik writes with a regal pen. She creates an adventure with splendid settings for the characters to gracefully parade through.  Ms. Laik treads lightly with sexually innuendos.  Though the allusions are no less potent; they are softly threaded throughout the story. This lends to an ageless and timeless appeal for the entire romance audience to enjoy.  How completely refreshing!<br /><br />Hugh is a very honorable man that takes his high standing in the social realm of London's elite society very seriously.  He is a man out for truth and justice, even if it means Charlotte Treadwell's downfall.  If only Charlotte's sexual allure was not so strong toward Hugh. He is only human.<br /><br />Charlotte's kindness seems to be working against her.  What should be taken as selfless deeds are turning into doubts concerning her whereabouts and motives.  Charlotte is truly in the dark about what is going on in the backgrounds of her life.  She only knows that her attraction to Hugh is strong - magnetic.<br /><br />If you are looking for an historical with adventure and romance without profanity or vulgarities, then you will want to read The Lady in Question by author Judith Laik!<br /><br />Reviewed by © Janalee Ruschhaupt, 2005<br /><br />Courtesy of Love Romances [...]	2005-10-12

This short book (70 pages of text) is Holmes' essay on the theory, origins of, developmental trajectory of, and end results of both healthy and unhealthy narcissism.  It is remarkably free from jargon, so it is appropriate for the lay person, but also has enough references to guide the college student or early graduate student.  The writing is quite good, in contrast to most of the stuff I have read on narcissism.<br /><br />I also liked the linking of the psychoanalytic concepts in narcissism to examples from literature (Ovid, Oscar Wilde, for example), and, of course, the Greek story itself.<br /><br />This short book took about two hours to read carefully.	2005-10-12

Her mother was a housemaid and her father was a minister. Both of them considered her a curse for the wrongdoings in their lives. Elphaba has a sister, Nessarose who has no arms, and a younger brother. The second section is when Elphaba goes to college. Her roommate is a beautiful young woman named Galinda, who later becomes Glinda the Good Witch. After leaving the school Elphaba disappears for a long time only to reappear after the death of her sister. Her sister had magical shoes which could be used for good and evil. When her sister dies Glinda gives the shoes to Dorothy, a mysterious girl whose house was responsible for Nessarose's death. The Wicked Witch sets out to get her sisters shoes back. <br /> This book was an interesting book because it gave another side to the story of The Wizard of Oz. Most people know the story from Dorothy's side, just an innocent young girl trying to get home to her aunt, who is being chased by the Wicked Witch of the West. This book goes into detail about the life of the Wicked Witch of the West and gives insight into how she became the witch she was in the movie. Although she is still slightly evil in the novel, after reading it one can't help but sympathize for her. The ending to the novel and the ending in the movie weren't quite the same, but they both gave the same reasons for the events that happened.  <br />Gregory Maguire did an excellent job telling the Wicked Witch of the West's story as a true one. Political and social issues were all covered in depth to give the country of Oz a more realistic feel. There were different classes of people, such as the Munchkins, the Gillikin, and Vinkus. These different aspects of the setting made the whole story seem more realistic. In the front of the book there is even a map showing the different regions within Oz. Maguire brought a fairy tale to life throughsituations one might find in real life society.  <br />	2005-10-12

The trees are described in their summer and winter aspects.  It is a fine reference book not a book to be used in the field to identify trees.  You should have an idea which general family of tree you are looking at to narrow the search down as the trees are arranged according to family.  At the beginning of each tree description is a section listing those characteristics that are most helpful in identifying the tree.  There is also a section at the end comparing the tree to those with which it is most likely to be confused. A glossary of terms is given at the back of the book and dichotomous keys to the families are given at the front.  At the beginning of each family more detailed dichotomous keys are given to help the reader distinguish one member of the family from another.

This is the second novel I have read by this author and I have come to the conclusion that she has a problem with endings.  She starts out great and the stories are interesting and she is taking on tough issues but then she wimps out.  The first one of hers I read was My Sister's Keeper.  Like this one, I picked it up because the synopsis sounded intriguing and like this one I was disappointed because she doesn't handle the very issue she's writing about.  In The Pact even she admits (in an interview) she let Chris off and the ending wasn't right.  Then why write it?  Her endings are emotional cheats.

I don't usually read novels in this genre, but I heard the author speak at an event and was intrigued enough by his knowledge of the times to buy the book. I was pleasantly surprised to find out how enjoyable it was. The lead character Brendan Prescott is an ordinary man who gets caught up in extraordinary circumstances. As he tries to discover who he is, a ruthless enemy hunts him. He makes friends with interesting people, like the King's childhood companion and a lady-in-waiting who is more than she seems. He does a great job of bring historical people like Elizabeth Tudor and her sister Mary to life but I enjoyed his villains most. They are complex and corrupt, determined to gain power at any cost, and they make Brendan's secret more dangerous and believable.	2005-10-12

His chosen images are NOT historically accurate, and are frequently so bizarre that they cannot possibly help convey the meaning to any reader. This is NOT helpful, no matter how much the author appears to believe it is; and neither are the senseless \\"mnemonics\\" he has created to accompany those inaccurate pictures. <br /> <br />Furthermore, it also contains many outright errors -- incorrect definitions and misdrawn Kanji -- and even if it HAD all been accurate, it completely fails to provide any context for how Kanji are actually USED in Japanese writing. <br /> <br />The result is that, AT BEST, persistent and diligent readers MAY eventually learn to associate some general meaning with each Kanji character. They will NOT learn how to read Japanese from this book, though. In fact, they will actually have been HAMPERED from doing so -- because they will have to UN-learn much of the nonsense this book fed them. <br /> <br />Perhaps for the reader who never really intends to learn Japanese, or who merely wants a superficial, trivial overview of the basic CONCEPT of Kanji, this book might have some marginal value. For anyone who actually wants to learn how to READ Japanese though, this book is a complete waste of time and money.	2005-10-12

The first half of the book dealt with laying the background to the story.  Shy Crissy decides to take a month long cruise with her not shy friend, Jenny.  They are unaware that the family that owns that cruise line is in huge financial trouble and the owner is planning on having the ship blown up to collect the insurance money.  It doesn't matter to him that there would be people on board when this occurs. <br /> <br />A lot of time is devoted to hearing every man that Crissy encounters tell her how beautiful, intelligent and interesting she is.  It gets old constantly reading that.  We get it, she's pretty.  She meets a guy at a bar, they go home together, and after one night, she believes he's \\"the one.\\"  Do I need to say she never hears from him again?  That was when she decided she needed to change her life and booked the cruise. <br /> <br />Once on the trip, she meets a group of people that her and Jenny spend most of their meals with.  Jenny hops from one guy to another and she gets jealous of Crissy because a guy that passed on her is interested in Crissy.  They argue, Jenny moves out of their cabin.  Crissy begins a secret affair with the ship's doctor.  Very slowly, the story then starts to pick up. <br /> <br />I am a person that will finish a book unless it's so horrible that it's impossible to do so.  I did consider giving up on this one, but that's when the story picked up, so of course, I had to finish it to see how it would end.  I won't give anything away, but there weren't any surprises to keep you guessing. <br /> <br />I've enjoyed Judith Gould's books in the past and I will try her next one.  I have to hope that it will be better than this one. <br /> <br />If you want to read this one, wait the six months until it comes out in paperback or rent it from the library.  It's not worth the hardcover price.	2005-10-12

He wrote a successful novel based on that experience, but then declined into writing potboilers under a pen name.  Now he is rediscovering himself.  Some bottles of Joe's homemade wine, salvaged from Pog Hill, seem to have mysterious properties, and lead Jay into the impulse buying of a French chateau in Lansquenet, where he joins into the smalltown atmosphere and begins to write a new novel.<br /><br />The story alternates between memories of Pog Hill, the small town he lost (converted into upscale housing developments) and Lansquenet, the small town he has found and wants to keep.  All is not as it seems in Lansquenet, especially with his neighbor, and forces are at work to make the town into another tourist destination.  Jay finds himself caught up in events, and drinking Joe's wine (his \\"specials\\") seems to bring back Joe, and redirects Jay's life.<br /><br />There is something about the specials, and unexpected value in Joe's seed collection.  There is more than one way to revive a town that is in decline.  And the blackberry wine, well, that is the last bottle, and you have to read the novel to get there.	2005-10-12

It was a nice follow-up to Nemesis, had the Titan crew coming together, playing around with Romulans politics. Great stuff. Yet, this one takes a rather odd step away. Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible, but it's also nothing to brag about. It's a rather average read that doesn't leave an impression like the first book did.<br /><br />One problem, as described in other reviews, is the extensive list of characters. Who can keep up with all of them? It's not as if the last book came out a month or so ago so if you were to pick this one up, you may find yourself struggling to remember this or that unique character. What makes it so bad is that a lot of these characters are secondary or fill-ins. We haven't been given the chance to focus on the main group. I hardly can pin-point who the main characters are because everyone who appears is given equal importance. The crew is diverse, one of the most diverse in Starfleet history. We get it! It makes the book terribly hard to get through when you vaguely can recall or keep up with the two dozen or so characters that appear.<br /><br />Second, there is no \\"gay agenda\\" going on. There's a gay character, so be it. Yet, I do feel that these authors, who do tend to include non-heterosexual characters in their works, are putting a bit too much emphasis on the character of Keru. What's the big deal about him? He appeared in \\"Rogue Agent\\" and wasn't exactly a ground-breaking character. He appears in the \\"Worlds of DS9.\\" He appears in the Riker-Troi honeymoon story in \\"The Captain's Table\\" anthology. Yet, he's not terribly interesting. Yet, he's given the most attention perhaps out of any of the \\"new characters\\" and it gets annoying. We barely get to know anything more about Dr. Ree, nor do we get anymore on Melora Pazlar, who appeared in a DS9 episode.<br /><br />As for the plot, this is another nit-pick. Why go from the stand-point of something truly original to revisiting one of your own novels? The Neyel are a race created by these same authors in the Excelsior Lost Era novel \\"The Sundered.\\" It seems as if the authors simply wanted to do a follow-up to that novel and bring in the Titan crew. The entire \\"Red King\\" idea seems hard to understand simply because the authors never really focus in on it. It goes from being something intriguing to suddenly become another big-space threat that the crew must out-think. And they do, but even that seems to go too easily.<br /><br />The authors make Keru's coma a big plot, yet the resolution is quick and simplistic. They make a big deal about the \\"Red King\\" but that plot comes off as unoriginal by the end. You feel as if you've seen it before, probably in a dozen Star Trek episodes. Even the Tuvok-Akaar conflict, once revealed, seemed a bit \\"Oh. That's all?\\" I wouldn't go so far as to call the book campy, but perhaps terribly predictable and under-whelming. There are some good plots that simply aren't carried out well. They seemed to realize there was no real humanoid threat or bad guy, so instead, they turn Donatra, who's been the rather good-Romulan with a lot on her shoulders, into the bad guy. Why destroy a good character like that? Why revisit \\"The Sundered\\" in a new series' second book? It seems a bit wasteful of space and money to find that the authors decide to hype up their past work more so than continue to build up the new series.<br /><br />That being said, the book is okay. It's sort of a quick read, but feels slow due to all of the characters packed in and the hand-full of plots being tossed at you. Hopefully, when a new author's take on the series and characters coming up in \\"Orion's Hounds,\\" Titan will be a tad bit more original and interesting than this installment.

Qwilleran has managed to become the heir of the community's wealthiest resident and must stay in Pickaxe for five years in order to inherit.  As we all know now, he lasted a lot more than five years, and may still be north of everywhere enjoying the foibles and gossip that play such an important part of the world's coziest cozies.<br /><br />Qwill has just moved into the Klingenshoen mansion with his two Siamese cats - Yum Yum the delectable and arch-detective Koko.  Koko, through various manipulations of his owner's behavior, manages to arouse Qwill's curiosity about the disappearance of a housemaid a few years previously.  In the process of investigating, the newspaperman introduces us to many of Pickaxes residents for the very first time.  When he isn't being his by trucks, that is.  It is interesting in retrospect to meet these characters again, who often started out one way and then became something else as Braun added layer after layer to her confection of characters and mysteries (and cats).<br /><br />I can only read so many of these in rapid succession before I have to stop.  Lilian Braun has a tendency to let her characters run in a groove with very little development over a number of volumes.  She makes up for this by using Qwilleran to create witty dialogue, but there are only so many Pickaxe witticisms that one can read before feeling a desire for something with a bit more meat to it.  This volume is a change of pace (if you've been reading in sequence).  There's a bit less sarcasm and a bit more story and that makes this one of the best of her early books.<br /><br />Don't look for a complicated mystery here.  Braun's villains tend to be obvious, and more often than not the means are just as visible.  You read these tales for lightweight enjoyment and the zany characters that chitchat their way through the pages.  And, of course, you read them because you can't resist Qwill's owners, the Siamese masterminds.hat their way through the pages.

He shows that human spirit and love of family, however beaten in his grotesque loss, rises above all else.  By the end of the journey, it is clear that peddaling was the least of Hancock's effort and merely wetting his feet in the Atlantic was the least of his triumphs.  The only thing more remarkable than the ride is the man.	2005-10-12

What a tragedy that icredibly beautiful writing like this is now compromised by sensitivities that Wolfe did not perceive.  A flaw that should be forgiven and yet is so difficult to do when confronted with the ugly racism of some passages.  However, if one can forgive, Wolfe is without doubt the greatest American writer.	2005-10-12

Not knowing these details of her personal story, I was inspired by her strong spirit and work on behalf of oppressed women around the world and found her extraordinary. I had no idea, sitting across from this accomplished, engaging woman, that her life also held such painful secrets. Her book is a gift to its readers and a much-needed voice for Iraqi women.	2005-10-12

I cannot think of another book that reads so much like an operatic aria. It is not so much a meditation on love as on all-consuming attraction, obsession, and eroticism. The story takes you into the mind of Giorgio, who is torn between two women who could hardly be more opposite. Clara is beautiful, healthy...and married. Fosca is sickly, desperate...and alluring. The two best things I can say about reading this book are:<br /><br />1) It challenges each of us to get in touch with the light and dark sides of human sexuality.<br /><br />2) The translation is absolutely outstanding. For readers who appreciate masterful translation work, or for those who study literature in translation, this is a must-read!	2005-10-12

This Frankenstein series is frustrating 'cuz I have to wait almost a year for it to end.  I felt like that when the first Lord Of The Rings movie came out and I knew the other two were already finished, but I had to wait two years for that trilogy to end.  These books of Koontz are like that.<br /><br />My other favorite Koontz book, out of the dozens he has written, is ONE DOOR AWAY FROM HEAVEN.<br /><br />Read the Frankenstein books.  You won't be disappointed.	2005-10-12

It's worse than his previous worst novel, Ancient Evenings, which single-handedly turned me off for years on all things Egyptian.<br /><br />No, I'm not some outraged evangelical railing at someone making use of \\"My Lord `n Savior,\\" I think Jesus is fair game and a fine topic for literature and speculation. But I'm not going to do as so many others seem willing to and automatically bestow praise on a book merely because it takes the sacred Jesus and casts him into the harsh light of modern judgment. In The Gospel According To The Son, Norman Mailer, proponent of the \\"non-fiction novel\\" (figure that one out) manages to make a good story dull and argumentative, drains all color and life from the plot, and delivers something that is SO dead on arrival it's unrecognizable as the tale of Jesus: a biography already filled with drama, betrayal, false arrest, torture, execution, and all the raw material of a gripping story. I've got to hand it to Mailer, not everyone could take a story ready-made for adaptation, all-but handed to him on a silver platter like the head of Saint John the Baptist, and then smash it down to third-rate nonsense. Here even the Devil was boring and it takes A LOT to ruin the best villain ever created. Mailer seemed to want to absent all vestiges of Christ from this little re-telling of the life of the historical man, Jesus of Nazareth, and I can actually respect that, but in rendering this material so skeptically humanistic as to be bland beyond tolerance puzzles me. I can't say I laughed out loud at the truly bad jokes slipped in here and there amid the equally execrable prose, but the line about \\"Peter was like a rock...he could be broken by a bigger rock...\\" elicited a genuine chuckle that something so lame made it past an editor.<br /><br />Right after he released this work back in the late `90's, I heard the author on NPR saying, in essence, \\"The Gospels are badly composed. There are many writers who could have written them better, and I am foremost among that number.\\" Mailer's ego knows no bounds and his trash talking was a little endearing. I just wish he was able to back it all up with a better book than this.<br /><br />The bottom line is this book blows. Skip it in favor of The Last Temptation of Christ, or read a good translation of the four Gospels.d.
