Keroro and his extraterrestrial compatriots, in a failed attempt to conquer Pokopen (the Earth), find themselves stranded in the company of two Pokopenian siblings, Fuyuki and Natsumi Hinata, and their friends and family. Hilarity ensues. There you go. That's the series - beyond that there is no real coherent plot. But that's not particularly important, because the fact is a complex storyline isn't required for madcap comedy of this order.  <br /> <br />The best comparison you can draw to Sgt. Frog is probably to Pinky & the Brain: overloaded with pop culture (Japanese anyway) allusions and socio-political send-ups, our protagonist conjures up preposterous scheme after preposterous scheme, to no avail. Another easy comparison would be with Invader Zim. The biggest difference between Sgt. Frog and these others, however, is the ensemble size: while P&B revolved around the clashing personalities of the title characters, and Invader Zim a team of four or so, Sgt. Frog is propelled by a stable cast of about a dozen unique, distinctly off-the-wall personalities.  <br /> <br />There's Natsumi Hinata, for instance, the Pokopenian teen whose authoritative hot-headedness remains the biggest obstacle on the path to invasion - apart from Sgt. Keroro himself, equal parts inept interstellar conqueror and freeloading plastic Gundam model fanatic. Then there's Natsumi's younger brother Fuyuki, a quiet, introverted kid with a keen interest in the occultm or Momoka Nishizawa, the insecure heiress to a worldwide fortune with a keen interest in Fuyuki. Not to mention Private Tamama, one of the Sgt.'s fellow-invaders, whose adorable exterior belies a violent split personality; the ditzy Lady Angol Moa, sent to Earth by her father the universal Lord of Terror to destroy it, but diverted by Keroro's misadventures; and many more.  <br /> <br />The various plots, goofy and overblown as they are, make fulluse of the characters' interpersonal chemistry. For instance: when the School Sports Festival rolls around, athletic Natsumi petitions mom Aki to join her in the child-parent activities. But Aki is unable to attend due to her demanding career as a manga editor, which causes her to be gone most of the time anyway. Natsumi is forlorn by yet another absence, and while Keroro schemes to stand in for Mom Hinata in an attempt to put Natsumi in his debt, Corporal Giroro, whose hard-boiled shell hides a monstrous affection for the girl, has other plans. Meanwhile, Fuyuki suffers from a lack of self-confidence living in his sister's athletic shadow, and wealthy Momoka's attempts to aid his cause at the Festival, like having her bodyguards tranquilize the other racers, are sweet but probably misguided. That's just a sampling, from one of the tamer chapters at that - the insanity quotient is generally far more in excess.  <br /> <br />Many of the installments have sensitive undercurrents: unrequited love, the clash between friendship and duty, jealousy, emotional insecurity, family dynamics, and so on. But there's something of overanalyzing in that evaluation, because any pyschological underpinnings involved are offset by copious coatings of over-the-top illustration, harebrained scenarios, laugh-out-loud hilarious gags, and unforgettably zany characters. Be forewarned: in spite of Keroro and Company's admitted adorability it's not for kiddies - there's enough sexual suggestion here to border on ecchi at times. But it's all in fun, and if you have a well developed sense of the absurd, as I like to put it, Sgt. Frog is as good n' silly as it gets.	2005-10-09

In his latest effort, the accomplished Ian Rankin takes on a host of contemporary issues: illegal immigration, racism, bureaucratic corruption, the slave trade, and more.  Strangely, despite the title, the prostitution plays only a background role in this complex and intelligent whodunit.  Back is curmudgeon Detective Inspector John Rebus, prowling the pubs of Edinburgh and environs while unraveling the mysteries of the murder of an unidentified immigrant in a run down housing project.  Rebus-partner Siobhan Clarke as a favor is investigating a runaway - the sister of a rape victim whose case Siobhan had previously dispatched.  Meanwhile, the skeletal remains of a woman and child are dug up in the basement of a \\"Fleshmarket Alley\\" watering hole.  Predictably, these seemingly disparate threads intertwine, while Rankin, in no hurry to satisfy the reader's curiosity, tediously layers plot upon subplot until all the dots finally connect.  For a less talented author, the slow pace and convoluted collection of races, places, and faces could prove frustrating, but Rankin's Rebus is a strong enough character to carry the load of an overly burdened plot, and interesting supporting players, richly drawn settings, and witty and gritty Scottish dialogue hasten the pace.  The obvious sexual tension between Rebus and Clarke provides some amusing distraction as Rankin dissects with the subtlety of a chain saw some very serious social issues.  In short, a complicated tale skillfully told, confirming Rankin's entitlement to the awards he's won.  A highly recommended read.	2005-10-09

Several new races and a new character class all look promising to try, and the world setting is rich and creative.  The world seems somewhat modeled on modern day earth, except cast in a fantasy setting. <br /> <br />Make no mistake, you'll have to revamp the way you do things for this game.  From the addition to action points (which represent the 'edge' that PC's have over the rabble) to a much more flexible alignment system (this world can have Neutral Good Red Dragons, and Lawful Evil Clerics serving a Chaotic Good god), there are a host of changes to the world. <br /> <br />In short, this campaign setting caters to the player who loves a game filled with intrigue, but can also be used to fuel a high-action, combat-heavy campaign.  The flexibility is what makes it great.  I plan on further purchases of support books for Eberron.	2005-10-09

He was a military genius, plantation owner, Indian fighter, a racist toward non-whites, controversial loser of the 1824 and easy winner of the 1828 & 1832 Presidential elections, orphan, scarred by the British and married to a married woman, his true love. Mr. Brands tells his story of a man of contradictions in 600+ pages.    Mr. Brands writes a dense, just the facts approach in his biography of this populist President from the West who campaigned against the elitist Northeast. The true climax of his Presidency was his delaying the onset of the Civil War with his staring down his own Vice-President and the South with a genuine military show of force during the secession crisis.    Mr. Brands has written the best one volume biography of the seventh President, surpasssing Robert Remini's own 400+ page condensation (\\"The Life of Andrew Jackson\\"--1988) of his classic trilogy on Andrew Jackson. However, given that Jackson was at the center of American history for over 60 years, the reader is referred to Mr. Remini's three volume definitive biography of 1,600 pages (1977, 1981, 1984) for a fuller, richer picture of this fascinating President. In deciding which to read, it depends on how much time and how much interest the reader has in Andrew Jackson.	2005-10-09

And before I go any further, I must admit to being a close friend of Felix's and have played a minor part in the life he writes about here. Which, I believe, gives me a unique perspective on the events and experiences in his story, because I've lived a similar life path. <br />I've found the book to be an honest,straightforward treatment of what it was like to be a performer in what was for quite a while, the most popular form of musical entertainment in this country, and probably the world, Dance Bands. But Felix also gives us the story of how musicians and singers were forced to adapt to the changing tastes of the public as the big band era was supplanted by Rock and Roll and the growing popularity of TV, and the phenomenon of legal gambling in the Casinos of Las Vegas and Reno. ..  and the story doesn't stop there.   <br />He manages to weave into his tale, some of the problems he faced. The moral dilemmas of sex and drugs, for instance, and the ongoing quest for self improvement in his musical abilities as well as how to achieve those things we all want from life, ..  security, family and Love.  <br />In successfully writing his story, he's shown us that he's successfully lived his life.  ..  and for that more than anything, I'm proud of him. <br />	2005-10-09

Someone was killing the sturgeon to \\"extract\\" the eggs to make caviar and is unconcerned about collateral damage to other fish.  However, Marquez does not have the manpower to stop the poachers as his unit has shrunk down to three while the criminals have gotten smarter, bigger, and more energetic, and the FBI steps in and out looking for sound byte poser cases only.<br /><br />Still he tries using informants to help him catch the crooks such as former sturgeon poacher Abe Raburn who Marquez pressures into testifying against former KGB agent Nikolai Ludovna, who came to the states allegedly as a realtor, but is the caviar poaching kingpin.  Abe proves uninformative perhaps out of fear of retaliation.  Russian-born field guide Anna Burdovsky agrees to help, but she vanishes without a trace following a meeting with specialty food storeowner Don August, who Marquez believes sells illegal caviar.  With potential problems at home, Marquez concentrates on expediting Anna from danger though he fears he is too late.<br /><br />The key to this fine fish and wildlife police procedural is the different personalities that make up the sturgeon poaching crowd as readers will understand the economic motivations of poachers, sellers, storeowners, users, law enforcement officials, and informants.  The story line is somewhat typical of the undermanned and under-equipped cops struggling to defeat superior forces while knowing a victory today just means a new criminal takes over the territory.  DEAD GAME is a fabulous tale that entertains the audience while also educating readers with how complex the environmental-economic issues are.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-10-09

Her father decides to have the house remodelled and engages the services of genius architect Erik D'Anton, who has very strict conditions for his participation, one of which is that he will only visit at night. Watching from the window as he arrives, Marisa first notices the black Lamborghini, and then the cape that the visitor wears. Once he's inside and she is introduced, she realises why he is so reclusive. His face is ruined, destroyed by an accident when he was seven. He wears a mask to cover up the fact that he has no nose and his skin is puckered and discoloured. <br /> <br />Marisa is drawn to this enigmatic, disfigured stranger who speaks only in a whisper, and demands that her father invite him to dinner. Erik, who never accepts social invitations, agrees, because he is equally drawn to Marisa. That dinner-party begins an at first covert, and later open, relationship between the two. <br /> <br />This book reads like a thirteen-year-old's attempt at novel-writing. We have the poor, reclusive hero with the tragic past, the man no-one can reach. We have the beautiful, pure young maiden who is the only one to see past the scars and into his soul. We have Erik falling deeply in love with Marisa, pining for her, driven desperate by his love for her. We even have Marisa ending up seriously ill in hospital as a result of pining for Erik - and, naturally, her illness brings him back rushing to her side. And, after her father dies tragically, of course Erik puts his own needs aside and is there for her, even braving the stares of all and sundry as he ventures out - horrors! - in daylight. And, of course, he then marries her. <br /> <br />Oh, the melodrama! Oh, the self-indulgence! Oh, the Mary Sue effect! (If you don't know what a Mary Sue story is, Google it. It will sound surprisingly like this book).  <br /> <br />It's all so improbable. I mean, really! A 31-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl? Doesn't that strike anyone as ever so slightly... sick? Almost paedophilic, even. Especially as she was 15 when they first met. Whether she was 16 or 17 when they first had sex I don't recall, but either way had I been her father or her housekeeper I'd have called the police. But apart from that, what on earth would this intelligent, professional *adult* see in this spoilt, over-indulged child? That baffled me until, as the book dragged on, I realised that Erik is little more than a child himself. He hides from the world, stuck in his own little universe of self-pity. It's no wonder that he has his `assistant', Raskin, to look after him; he's not safe to be let out alone. <br /> <br />In fact, even ten, fifteen years later, when Erik and Marisa have been married for well over a decade, it's quite clear that neither of them could manage without Raskin and Kitty. Those two are the nursemaids looking after two mentally stunted thirteen-year-olds in adult bodies. Oh, poor me! Nobody loves me! Everybody hates me! I hate myself!  <br /> <br />Certain parts of the book had me rolling my eyes even more than others. When Marisa phones Erik, early on, to ask why he's avoiding her and asks why he hates her, I couldn't believe that he wasn't repulsed by her childish behaviour. But, no, he beats himself up for making her unhappy and actually invites her to spend time with him. And when she turns up in her *nightgown* night after night he never even comments, let alone suggests that she might consider dressing more appropriately.  <br /> <br />Then there's the whole question of Erik's face. Hasn't he ever heard of plastic surgery? Prosthetics? Sure, he had 22 skin grafts when he was a kid. But that was more than 20 years ago by the time the book starts. Isn't he aware of the advances in medical science? Does he really want to hide from the world that badly? Or is it that Vale Allen will stop at nothing to produce this pale travesty of Phantom of the Opera? <br /> <br />Oh, and then there's Marisa's problems with contraception. Hasn't Erik ever heard of condoms? <br /> <br />I agree with at least one other reviewer that it's astonishing this teenage diary fodder ever saw the light of day. What a waste of paper! <br /> <br />- wmr-uk <br />	2005-10-09

He plays with words in interesting ways, expanding the child reader's vocabulary without them even realizing that they are being taught.  But most important in the books, is the message of perseverance through diversity, the love of family, and the importance of true friendship.  In a world that portrays the mythical exsistance of an easy world, the author helps to balance that perspective by providing a different view.

I read this book a number of years ago and I keep coming back to it because of its terrific message.<br /><br />The book is layed out on a day-to-day format with short chapters that helped me to overcome difficulties and strengthen what I need to work on.  Perfect for reading first thing in the morning.<br /><br />After the first time I read this book, many of my friends asked me what I had done with myself because I had changed so much.  Very positive and very empowering.<br /><br />Look for the 6-tape audio cassette program too.  It's fantastic.  Great for the car.	2005-10-09

Can you picture this:  me coming up with an original post.  I know, I know, when you post a couple of dozen times a day, you have to recycle a few bow wows, what can I say? <br /> <br />And like I said before, the problem is that if I actually knew anyone who'd been in Vietnam I'd know the PXs sold those little handheld 8mm cameras to all the GIs, and if I actually looked at any of the websites those swift boat vets put up, I'd see plenty of home movies they took !!!!   And if I read anything but wingnut chatroom gossip I'd know that every single person who's seen Kerry's home movies says not only are they not \\"exagerrated exploits,\\" but he barely appears in them - and of course he was so intent on using them to \\"advance his political career\\", he waited a whole 35 years and 8 campaigns before using even that whopping 30 seconds, with nary an \\"exploit\\" in sight.   Whoa, my bad.    But hey ..... better than having to come up with a NEW idea !!!!   Maybe even read the book I'm supposed to be reviewing..... NOOOOOOOOO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Of course if I had read the book I'd know that not even a lying little slug like John O'Neill claims Kerry ever said he spoke to Nixon or any other President when he was in Cambodia.

Rachel Andrew's new book for Dreamweaver 8 book is not a good book. In an effort to be first on the market with a book for Dreamweaver 8 it is a total let down. If you don't have experience with Dreamweaver, forget it. It you own a Macintosh, forget it. Ms. Andrew has her strong points, she is an expert when it come to the mechanics of web design, but her ability to communicate that knowledge is a total loss. One of the big points is that she leaves out important insturctions and if she does include them they are impossible to understand. She has you do certain procedures, and then  she backtracks and adds to the procedure after the fact.  The book is written with Windows in mind and Mac user are left our, especially for Server Side Inclues, a tool used to merge style sheets. I tried to complete the exercises but, in the end, certain ones did not work and that were relevant  to the over all success to the  project. I finally gave up in the middle of the book, angry and frustrated because it was such waste of my time. I plan on returning it asap.

But I am a serious musician and this is the first fiction book I have read (people constantly give me books about \\"musicians\\" and I can never get past the first few innacurate,idealized pages), to portray the life of a classical musician accurately. (Try Hilary and Jackie for a non-fiction account, although now that's a very depressing story, Body and Soul is not.) For those who aren't musicians it may be hard to understand, that yes, people do \\"sponsor\\" and mentor young musicians with talent. No amount of money can instill this gift, it's a democratic talent. When musicians have this gift, and not just the ability, you can feel it radiating off of them, and it's intoxicating. I've been loaned gorgeous instruments I could never afford, been given ridiculously low prices for repair; once I had my instrument stolen and bought a cheap one to replace it,which I took to the repair shop.  It was returned to me in an expensive case, completely outfitted and repaired--like Cinderella and the pumpkin. (And I'm nowhere near as talented as Conroy's hero.)So, the story rings true although it's not a common story. The hero's talent is massive, and there is only a handful of musicians it could pertain to in the entire world, but it's accurate as well as beautifully told and skillfully written. I was sad to come to the last pages, so I'm returning to this wonderful book.	2005-10-09

I find it truly \\"incredible\\" that this author spends 357 written pages attacking the dispensationalism and fundamentalism beliefs and never \\"once\\" answers the very title of the book! Will Catholics be left behind? I will state for the record that I am neither a dispensationalist or fundamentalist but consider myself a non-denominational born-again Christian and an ex-catholic having practiced catholism for 26 years before \\"finally\\" finding the truth in the Word of God the King James Bible 21 + years ago! I have known many catholics over the years who have \\"never\\" opened one page of the Bible in their entire lives and have \\"blindly\\" followed the catholic doctrine preached from the pulpit without ever trying to prove what was being taught! (A common practice in catholism to keep people \\"dummied down\\" in matters of Scripture). This man Olson attacks LaHaye, Lindsey and others for their beliefs but then spends 357 pages doing exactly what he claims LaHaye, Lindsey, et all; have \\"no\\" right whatsoever to do! Talk about the \\"pot calling the kettle black\\"! He makes the statement on page 274 that \\"Scripture is not the church's only rule of faith\\"! An incredible statement when God, Himself tells us in 2Tim3 and many other scriptures that \\"His Word is sufficient for all things\\"! False doctrines emerge from councils and individuals when they \\"fail\\" to understand God's wording of \\"ALL THINGS\\"! He never once touches on John 3:3 in the book where Jesus Himself tells us that \\"No one will enter the Kingdom of Heaven unless he be Born-Again\\"! It does'nt matter if it be by the \\"Rapture\\" which incidentally is incredibly \\"clear\\" in 1Thes4:13-18 or by physical death! Folks, \\"CATHOLICS\\" or anyone else for that matter \\"Will Be Left Behind\\" if they are not \\"BORN-AGAIN\\"! Jesus said this, not I! On page 292 Olson states that the dispensationalist first creates the theological system, then builds doctrines supporting the system, then searches texts substantiating the doctrines. This is \\"exactly\\" how the Catholicism, Mormonism, Jehovah Witnessing, etc., doctrines were produced! On page 320, Olson accuses LaHaye of \\"speculating, often irresponsibly about end-times wrath from God\\". Well \\"Catholic Folk\\" take a \\"GOOD\\" read of the Bible from page 1 to the last page in Revelation and you will find many, many passages of scripture where God does exactly that! Dealing with man's sin to the point that whole civizations were destroyed by God because of man's rejection of God and His Word! Try reading Jeremiah chapter 44 if you want a sampling! Hiding your head in the sand does not make the Bible go away or make God change the wording! God has \\"not\\" given man the authority to change or twist His Word around to their liking. Scriptures, 1Cor4:6 and Rev 22:18-19 are just two of many that warn us against this practice. In summation I give all catholics (and others) a warning: Any of you who have \\"NOT\\" accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour and turned your heart and life fully over to Him (100%) will \\"BE LEFT BEHIND\\". Do as I did. Prove the catholic doctrine the lie and deception it is through the writing of this type of book by studying the scriptures and finding out for yourself that the major points of catholicism are \\"not\\" based on the Word of God but on man-made doctrine!	2005-10-09

Still suffering the emotional and physical after effects from the events in the previous entry, The Waking Nightmare, Dr. Mark Sloan takes a morning walk on the beach outside of his Malibu home...and finds a dead body.  The mystery takes an immediate turn to the personal when a strange clue links the murder to the very first homicide case Sloan investigated, back in 1962.  Sloan himself narrates the 1962 segment of the story, which is a fine little mystery, and the reader comes away knowing more about what makes the crime solving doctor tick than before.  Lee Goldberg (who wrote and produced several seasons of the Diagnosis Murder television series) has added an emotional layer to this mystery that makes it the best in the series to date.  Highly recommended.	2005-10-09
US	26067584	R20X6IW3LIYBRD	0674006712	431315804	Empire	Books	3	54	69	N	N	Exercise In Neo-Marxist Scholasticism Short on Relevance	\\"Empire\\", which is now going on five years, attempts in its atmospheric prose to elucidate a totalizing world view of the future of the global economy.  What emerges is an optimistic, incurably Hegelian proposition that the current globalization of economics and society, despite its oppressive characteristics, are a necessary (and inevitable) stage of modern capitalist development which must exist in order to bring about the mobilization of the \\"multitude.\\"  Hardt and Negri's boundless faith in the eventual triumph of the \\"multitude\\" (i.e. proletariat) is definitively neo-Marxist and utopian.  Hardt and Negri further view the struggle as cutting across culture, class, race, and nationality, and that it must be seen as as multi-disciplinary liberation.<br /><br />Given today's bleak political environment dominated by a conservative, evangelical and thoroughly warlike United States, and a progressive dialogue principally limited to finding the faults of the power structure rather than offering any coherent alternative structures of political economy, I grasped \\"Empire's\\" cheery exposition of globalism as a necessary, if evil, transition to a utopian state like a drowning man to a raft.<br /><br />The problem - or a problem - with \\"Empire\\" is that it is like the auntie's Christmas fruitcake, likely to sit on one's shelf, only partly eaten, glowering sullenly until finally stashed away.  If I still taught political science, I would torture my students with this book, much as I was tortured with Althusser and Foucault, the bread and butter of 1960s academic Marxists.  Marxism remains a very valuable tool of historical criticism, as evidenced by such present-day historians as Eric Hobsbawm and Howard Zinn.  As a predictive tool of historical development, and as a societal endpoint, it requires tremendous and unqualified leaps of faith and adaptations which are hard to relate to reality.  When pressed to explain what the \\"liberated multitude\\" would look like, it is anyone's guess.  If this is the anti-globalist Bible, as one reviewer so expressively states, there better be a thick codex to go with it.<br /><br />There are plenty of good observations in \\"Empire\\" of the development of globalism and the erosion of nation-state dichotomies, but this is not particularly revolutionary.  In fact, what is surprising is Hardt and Negri's faithfulness to conventional Marxist conversations regarding the future of the \\"proletariat\\" and the \\"working class.\\"  Likewise, they fall into the trap of characterizing the national liberation struggles of the 1960s and 1970s as some sort of organic global challenge to capitalist economies, when in fact, wars such as Algeria, Angola and Vietnam were anti-colonial and distinctly nationalist.  Given the chance, political autonomy ranked far higher to these emerging states than faithfulness to socialist equity.  Indeed, unless one has lived as an academic hermit or (maybe this is a cheap shot at Negri) in a prison cell, capitalist corporatism is as triumphant as it has ever been.<br /><br />\\"Empire's\\" analytical flaws are not hard to uncover.  I had to wince at points where Negri points to the \\"Los Angeles uprising\\" (the spasm of a riot following the acquittal of Rodney King's police assaulters) as a historical event on a par with the liberation of South Africa, or opportunistically observing that rap music is the emerging voice of the liberated \\"multitude\\" (obviously Negri has not seen Spike Lee's \\"Bamboozled.\\").  Unlike the late Edward Said who was unparalleled at interweaving culture and political economy with uncanny precision (\\"Orientalism\\", \\"The Culture of Imperialism\\"), Hardt and Negri mostly engage in trivialities.<br /><br />The opacity of most of the prose in \\"Empire\\" is, unfortunately, endemic to European neo-Marxist theory after the 1970s.  What appears on first reading as precise diction is actually quite imprecise, yielding any number of interpretations which can be shaped to fit evidentiary dataor events (to the extent such data exists).  Paragraphs typically start with a declarative statement introducing a \\"paradigm\\" but then we are told that the reality is \\"less clear\\", subject to \\"disarticulation\\" or complex \\"matrices.\\"  From page 319:<br /><br />\\"In Empire, as indeed was also the case in modern and ancient regimes, the constitution itself is a site of struggle, but today the nature of that site and that struggle is by no means clear.  The general outlines of today's imperial constitution can be conceived in the form of a rhizomatic and universal communication network in which relations are established to and from all its points or nodes. Such a network seems paradoxically to be at once completely open and completely closed to struggle and intervention.\\"  Say what?  I thought asparagus was a rhizome.  As good Marxist scholastics, Negri and Hardt are consummate name droppers, which frequent references propel the footnotes and the narrative, while reducing to tears the average reader whose Foucault is still in the boxes of books left over from grad school.  The frequent references to authors such as Delenze and Habermas are of little value to readers who do not have their shelves crammed full of such works, let alone actually read them.  Each such reference, of course, is a meaningful shorthand for a cascade of complex ideas which becomes immediately lost to the uninitiated.<br /><br />In the final analysis, though, \\"Empire\\", while an entertaining utopian epic, is topically irrelevant.  Since the end of the Cold War, the upward struggles of the \\"multitude\\" have been overshadowed by the epic battle for resource domination (oil) in the Middle East and Southwest Asia.  After 2001, this struggle in turn has been exacerbated by the medievalist  religious conflict between Wahabist Islam and Puritan America.  In no way did (or could) Hardt and Negri foresee the grim, gray \\"forever war\\" now undertaken by the United States, perverting the wartime command economy created over a half-century ago by Roosevelt into a mechanism to channel untold revenue to a select circle of military-industrial corporations.  This, not Negri's, is the real story of Empire.identiary data or events (to the extent such data exists).

Since the end of the Cold War, the upward struggles of the \\"multitude\\" have been overshadowed by the epic battle for resource domination (oil) in the Middle East and Southwest Asia.  After 2001, this struggle in turn has been exacerbated by the medievalist  religious conflict between Wahabist Islam and Puritan America.  In no way did (or could) Hardt and Negri foresee the grim, gray \\"forever war\\" now undertaken by the United States, perverting the wartime command economy created over a half-century ago by Roosevelt into a mechanism to channel untold revenue to a select circle of military-industrial corporations.  This, not Negri's, is the real story of Empire.	2005-10-09

The land of Elsewhere drew me in and wouldn't let go. <br />This book has a very unique idea which sounds gimmicky, but definitely isn't.  Somehow, the fantasy seems realistic. <br />However, the writing (though engaging) does not challenge you or keep you guessing.  It is fairly simple.  This might be better than challenging writing, because the idea is so complex that complex writing might be overwhelming.  But the simple writing gets worse towards the end and there are no cliffhangers.  It takes no chances. <br />Also, you can't really identify with the main character very much.  Liz reflects what many of us would do in her situation, but she is not likable and you can't feel very sorry for her.   <br />Even though the writing is a little flawed and characters needed to be worked on, this book is able to rise above that.  Elsewhere is definitely recommended for those who are tired of the pathetic teen novels.	2005-10-09

Sequel to THE HUNDREDTH MAN, featuring the unusual duo detectives Carson Ryder and Harry Nautilus in the Mobile, AL, PD . Due to the unusual moniker the two have been given - the psychopathological and sociopathological investigative team (PSIT) - they catch the weird case of a dead naked female in a seedy hotel - surrounded by candles and buried under flowers.  More bodies turn up - accompanied by with an oil painting.  Carson is contacted by a retired PD regarding the murders with the paintings, connecting it to an unsolved serial killer case.  This brings to light a whole new world of murder memorabilia - and once again involves Carson's brother.  I haven't read the first in the series - although I have it - and I didn't need it to thoroughly enjoy this novel - but I would have understood more of the undercurrents if I had.

This is the author's journey researching an inane army experiment, and what manifestations may remain.   This book is no more an investigative proof than Ronson's last novel was an argument for joining extremists.  This book is Errol Morris, not Art Bell. <br /> <br />   Wholly enjoyable and entertaining, it's hard to remember at times this is non-fiction, as some of the interviews seem insane.  The presentation base comes from declassified goverment documents.  However, they are not included, nor are there any footnotes, because Ronson is not trying to convince the reader of anything.  He is writing about his interviews and conversations investigating the chronology of the \\"First Earth Battalion\\" manual.  I believe Ronson started this project intending it to be much funnier (he is a comedian after all), but some of the subject matter and personas he found, though entertaining, aren't laughable: staring at a goat trying to kill sounds funny, but imagine the views of a person who wishes they had the ability to kill people with their mind.  So it is a perspective on the legacy of a few persons relieved of common sense, that were given a little power and a budget. <br /> <br />You might enjoy this book if you: <br /> <br />  - Find Jon Stewart (The Daily Show) funny. <br />  - Like character documentaries, like those by Errol Morris. <br />  - Enjoy psychology. <br />  - Want a light introduction to a bizzare goverment-funded experiment. <br /> <br />You probably won't enjoy this book if you: <br /> <br />  - Are looking for hard documentation on goverment conspiracy <br />  - Believe our goverment would never do bad things to people <br />  - Are uncomfortable with light critisism of George W.

I first stumbled across this book through my daughter; we're both manga fans, and she reads the artist's online journal. The premise is certainly fascinating. My brother is gay, and I was curious how \\"Steady Beat\\" would handle the coming out experience. Everybody reacts a little differently, and some simply don't react at all. How would Rivkah portray this experience not only through the gay character, but the straight ones as well? <br /> <br />\\"Steady Beat\\" is stunning in its simplicity. There is a modern edge to the art I find extremely appealing, and I like that it isn't as cluttered as lot of other titles I've read. The characters are expressive but not overly so. The protagonist's internal monologue is punctuated with facial expressions that are original but still recognizable. And I LOVE all the hidden motifs like the \\"elephant in the room\\" reference for uncomfortable moments and the Texan (and American) cultural context of the story. <br /> <br />However, what really jumped out to me about \\"Steady Beat\\" were the characters. They feel like real people--I found I could easily relate to the main character's thoughts and reactions to the situation--I remember a lot of the same confusion when my brother came out to me fifteen years ago, and found myself chuckling in recognition of her naivete. It's only a big deal when it's still a secret! So just ask her already! <br /> <br />While Leah is in sharp contrast to her \\"perfect\\" older sister, Sarai, both obviously have similar doubts and ambitions. I especially enjoyed the love-hate relationship between the two sisters. It's obviously they love each other, but like all siblings, it's a love hidden by default. <br /> <br />Of particular interest to me is the mother: she's a State Senator, and it's obvious this fact will be playing a pretty important role later in the series. But the creator for \\"Steady Beat\\" only lightly touches on this fact, hinting at a much deeper plot further down the line. Volume 1 feels more like an introductory story--establishing characters, setting, and theme--and setting up readers for a more fast-paced story. <br /> <br />My only complaint with the book as that it is at times difficult to follow where someone is talking or thinking to themselves. In chapter four, dialog balloons are missing. However, this didn't detract from my overall enjoyment and of \\"Steady Beat\\". It's beautifully drawn, reads smooth and quick, and I felt drawn into a world I really want to see more of. It's a delicious tease that leaves me eagerly awaiting future volumes!	2005-10-09

Rejected by the `beautiful' people? Made to feel inadequate?<br /><br />In the opening chapter of The Martyr's Song, we meet Marci, a girl who knows first-hand what it means to feel rejected. With lowered eyes, she forces herself forward, through the crowd and toward the school building and her locker. The new skirt she had saved up for months to buy no longer gave her the courage she had hoped for. Instead she is met with taunting comments.<br /><br />\\"Nice skirt.\\"<br /><br />\\"You wearing that dress tonight?\\"<br /><br />Nothing they could say could embarrass her any further. Of the entire eleventh grade, she was the only one not invited to tonight's party.<br /><br />\\"Please, she isn't even going. And if she showed up in that, we'd have to lock her in the bathroom to keep the boys from throwing up.\\"<br /><br />They skip away, leaving behind painful wounds and an empty school.<br /><br />As she stands in the vacant school hallway, a woman approaches. \\"Come to my flower shop tomorrow, and I will make you beautiful,\\" the woman promises.<br /><br />Marci is stung by the woman's words, angered that even this stranger has the nerve to call her `ugly'. The next day Marci does go to the flower shop, not to let the woman `make her beautiful' but to tell the woman exactly what she thinks of her, and her offer.<br /><br />But when Marci arrives at the shop, she discovers that the woman, Eve, wasn't talking about physical beauty, or even inner beauty.<br /><br />Eve tells Marci that true beauty will come to her only when she embraces a long-forgotten story. Eve then tells Marci the story of Father Michael and thirteen-year-old Nadia, a child considered ugly with her coarse looks, blotchy freckles, and left leg two inches shorter than her right.<br /><br />And so begins Dekker's story within a story, a retelling of a tale contained in the opening pages of Ted Dekker's When Heaven Weeps, the second title of his earlier Martyr's Song series.<br /><br />The story is set in war torn Bosnia, in the 1940s. A group of soldiers, lead by Commander Karadzic, comes across a small village, untouched by the combat that surrounds it. Karadzic is intent on restoring Serbia, purging anyone he doesn't consider a good Serb, especially Franciscans who approved the murder of hundreds of thousands of Serbs by Yugoslavia's Ustashe army.<br /><br />Unable to understand why this church remains standing when all the others within a hundred kilometres have been burned to the ground, Karadzic becomes convinced it is a Franciscan church, protected by the Ustashe. When he finds Father Michael and the remaining villagers in the church courtyard celebrating Nadia's birthday, he decides to put the villagers' faith to the test, with deadly results.<br /><br />As Karadzic's inhuman game unfolds, readers glimpse life beyond the present through the eyes of Father Michael. The skin of this world peels away to reveal the world that awaits; a world full of laughter and a song that caresses the soul. A world where Nadia is beautiful.<br /><br />By the time Eve finishes the story, Marci knows a secret that will change her life forever. She learns that in the eyes of heaven we are all beautiful, even her.<br /><br />The Martyr's Song, poignant in its first telling within When Heaven Weeps, is even more so in this novella which includes a CD of a song performed by Todd Agnew and co-written by Agnew and Dekker exclusively for this book. A list of discussion questions at the back of the book draws readers deeper into the book's theme. Dekker invites us to search our souls and discover if we are in true anticipation of heaven, or simply enamored with our temporal life on earth.<br /><br />This book struck my heart in a powerful way. Like Marci, I struggled with feelings of insignificance, and fought to fit in when considered the `outsider'. Unlike Marci, I didn't have an Eve in my life to teach me what every child in this situation needs to learn.<br /><br/>I believe this book is a must read for any teenager who struggles with issues of self-worth, or who faces peer pressure to conform to today's standards. Once more Dekker reaches out through story to expand our imagination and teach a timeless message. Once more I have been changed as a result.<br /><br />Featured by World Vision during its 30 Hour Famine campaign, THE MARTYR'S SONG is set to reach the youth of today with a powerful message to love all that cross our path.on needs to learn. <br /> <br />I believe this book is a must read for any teenager who struggles with issues of self-worth, or who faces peer pressure to conform to today's standards.

US	12119288	R378UN6KAAUIUE	1589822684	318775142	Lincoln in the Basement	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Evocative and Intriguing Civil War Novel	Lincoln in the Basement <br />By Jerry Cowling <br /> <br />This intriguing \\"what-if\\" historical novel hinges on the notion that a double - controlled by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton -- stood in for President Abraham Lincoln in the last years of the Civil War.  That premise, of course, raises a host of other ideas to be explored: Could someone really kidnap the President and his wife and hold them prisoner - and keep it a secret?   Could the government continue to function under such a pretense?  What difference would it make in the way the war was fought and how it came out?  And how would such a scheme affect those who are caught up in it - particularly the Lincoln family and those closest to the charade?      <br /> <br />Author Jerry Cowling follows the spreading tentacles of Stanton's plot and its impact on characters both famous and obscure.  Lincoln is the hero here - steady, wise and compassionate, even in the face of such an outrageous subterfuge against the country and his presidency.  Stanton is the arch-villain, of course -- arrogant, obsessed with power and indifferent to the suffering of those caught up in his web of deceit.  Yet there is some compassion even for Stanton, a man struggling with the death of a child and his wife's depression.  Other historical figures have roles as well, and Cowling takes the opportunity to offer some insight on their characters: Mary Todd Lincoln and her son Tad, members of the Lincoln Cabinet, John Wilkes Booth, Mary Surratt, the formidable Civil War nurse Dorothea Dix, and an odd, unnamed man who can only be Walt Whitman.   <br /> <br />As he weaves the threads of these lives together against the backdrop of the war, Cowling evokes the Washington of the Civil War era.  He gives us a sense of the wartime tension in the capital, and of what a different place it was then - often dirty, lawless and unhealthy, and yet a city where the President of the United States could stroll down Pennsylvania Avenue for a consultationat the War Department. <br /> <br />We all know how it ends, of course, as Lincoln, finally restored to office, goes off to meet his destiny at Ford's Theater.  The fate of the novel's other characters is no less gloomy, for the most part.  But with the end of the war also comes a sense of hope, and with our advantage of historical hindsight, we know that it really will - eventually -- turn out all right in the end.  Cowling's novel gives us a starting point to muse on the workings of political power - and what might have happened if history had worked out differently.	2005-10-09

I say \\"obvious\\" because while the writing can at times be raw and *seemingly* honest, frank and revealing, it's also often cliche-ridden and downright grimace-inducing.  Take for example, her 2-year relationship with John Enos.  Enos was \\"the kind of guy my mother should have warned me about...an appetite for destruction...proceed at your own risk...bull in a china shop, a walk on the wild side...drank Jack and Cokes like water...life in the fast late...had seen it all\\" I mean, C'MON!  That's all in two paragraphs of sloppy writing.  Most of the book is better than THAT, but it's not literature by any means. <br /> <br />Second, it's clear the lady is stunningly beautiful and undeniably has drive.  The book is positively filled with color and b&w photos of Traci and since we're not going to learn too much we don't already know from the text, this is one way of making up for it.  As regards ambition, clearly the most obvious thing to emerge from her porn/drugs/alcohol/abuse anguish and subsequent therapy was a powerful desire to prove herself as an actress, model, singer and a worthy person, and to her credit, over the years she has built up an enviable career.  It could not have been easy. <br /> <br />What is missing from the book however, despite the years of therapy she describes, is a connection between the porn star past and her present.  Lords writes often that some in Hollywood wanted nothing to do with her professionally after her bust, but she misses the point that some DID, using her notoriety to help sell movies or lingerie or clothes.  To this day, having decided to use her \\"Traci Lords\\" name personally and professionally, she isbenefitting and capitalizing on the sizzle that goes with it.  Nothing wrong with that - this is show business, and she's not the only one selling associations with sex - but it's the fact.  As Traci she has gotten a good deal further than she could have as Nora. <br /> <br />Additionally, while no doubt the whole porn time took place in a drug-feuled haze and much of interest might have been lost down the memory-hole, there are plenty of loose ends that ought to have been wrapped up, but aren't.  Aside from death threats from some (who?) in the porn industry in the wake of the bust, was she or anyone else actually charged with anything?  Anyone sentenced at all?  Did her mother's appearance at all these trials make any difference to anyone?   How about some kind of look back? <br /> <br />The book is definitely not a tell-all about the porn industry - read Jerry Butler's book for that.  It is the here's-my-life-so-far story of a messed up girl from a messed up family from Steubenville (also home of Dean Martin, who likewise did reasonably well in Hollywood), trying hard to show us that she's gonna make it after all.	2005-10-09

I puzzled over the dustjacket cover before I read it, and now I think it is grand.  <br /> <br />The book was menacing and funny at the same time. It was a deer fly buzzing round my head that I kept swatting at and missing and still it would not let me be, teasing me with menace, whispering cunning little aside jokes that make me laugh in spite of myself.  <br /> <br />The last chapter brought it all together for me, but this is not one I would recommend to my wife. She wants to know exactly what happened, and she would not think the plot moved quickly enough nor that the ending was clear enough.  <br /> <br />And for you? Heck, I can't tell. As I say, the writing is excellent and the bookstore setting may appeal to you. Humor and metaphor glow softly in this foggy darkness like fireflies.  The author worked for a while at Borders and he takes some stabs at Book Business Bureaucracy, but that isn't exactly what the book is about. And it is so ambiguous that, if you choose to read it, you will simply have to decide for yourself. <br /> <br />I enjoyed it immensely. <br /> <br />I'm now sending for his THE DARKEST PART OF THE WOODS which is extensively blurbed on the back of the dustjacket of THE OVERNIGHT.	2005-10-09

Ironically, given his fundamental religious upbringing, the closest parallel I found were the televised admissions of guilt broadcast by certain evangelist preachers who have been caught in sexual or financial improprieties. We are expected to be forgiving simply because they are being so blatantly candid, even if they show no sign of self-awareness or growth. And, despite the author's claims towards the end of the book to have embraced sobriety and a revised form of faith, one can still see the same old insecurities peeking between the narrative line. I quite simply found Rich Merritt to be an incredibly self-absorbed person. He wites at the end of this book that, although he set out to write about himself he found his book was actually about lots of other people. Wrong! This book is entirely about Mr. Merritt and his ego which needs constant validation. The people that flit in and out of his story are never given the depth they require and so they read like so many cardboard figures. As an example, I would point to his long-suffering partner Brandon who becomes a hopeless enabler trapped in a addictive relationship. The only glimpses the author gives us into their relationship revolve around Brandon's struggles to come to terms with all the deceptions visited on him by the author. Pages are devoted to how Mr. Merritt lies to Brandon about his porn past, his numerous infidelities, his drinking and drug habits, etc. And this destructive behaviour is excused in the author's mind because Brandon doesn't make him feel attractive or special enough. I would have to ask, who could?! Then, after the author commits the ultimate in selfish acts by trying to commit suicide a few weeks after standing up at Brandon's 40th birthday party and declaring his desire to grow old with him, Brandon finally wakes up and realizes he needs to get away from this destrucive person. The author, however, reacts as if Brandon has abandoned him and their relationship and hurt him deeply in the process. There is a complete lack of self-awareness for his actions that is repeated throughout the book. He seems to have so little insight into people that he cannot really write about them in a meaningful way. As a result, they do not engage the reader and so when the author suddenly discusses their importance in his life we are left uncertain as to the reason why they have achieved this role. He rhymes off names as if he wants to impress his audience with the number of people with whom he is acquainted. And he all to often defines the men as being \\"handsome\\" or \\"sexy\\" first and \\"good\\" or \\"decent\\" second. Indeed, it seems that the fact that a man is hot is enough for the author to view him as valuable. I would cite the passage where the author is out with his friends by the ocean and is engaged in conversation by \\"the hottest man on the beach\\". He describes how they have had a meaningful conversation and how this person is a veritable angel for him. One has to wonder if he would feel this strongly if the man had been middle-aged and overweight. Indeed, would the author have even bothered to talk to such a person? Mr. Merritt is far to preoccupied with the physical and his text is peppered with comments such as \\"I was looking the hottest I ever had\\" or \\"I had a great bod and the guys were hot for it\\" or \\"the director told me I would do really great in porn\\". Who cares? He takes such delight in describing in lurid detail his descent into sex and drugs that he leaves little room to write about his recovery. Indeed, whatever recovery there is doesn't seem to concern him as much. He merely tells us he has gone through a lot of therapy and neglects to describe his path to self-awareness and growth. One has to wonder if the reason he doesn't write about it is because it hasn't entirely happened. At the end of the book he writes about his newest boyfriend and, once again, the first things he mentions are that this man is \\"handsome\\" and that he was \\"mad about the me (the author)\\". The problem for me was that I read through this lengthly, depressing tome expecting that somehow the author would turn his life around and learn from his self-destructive behaviour to become a better person. Instead, I sense that this is person who has not really grown from his life experiences. Writing about your life is a great way to reflect on it and reach some solid conclusions. But all we get here is some Dr. Phil inspired pop-psychology that reaches the mind-numbing conclusion that it is important to be there for our friends. Sad to say, based on this book, Mr. Merritt expects his friends to be there entirely for him, even when his narrative shows us that he frequently chooses not to return the favour.	2005-10-09

His theology was not contained in a massive, multi-volume systematic treatment, but rather in the practical and spiritual applications he drew out of his philosophical and theological meditations.  This collection of essays shows both the practical and spiritual aspects of what Niebuhr was about - they deal with ethics, politics, justice, the interplay of science and religion, and above all, God's grace and mercy that extends to the entire world.<br /><br />The first book of Niebuhr's that I read was 'Leaves from the Notebook of a Tamed Cynic', in which Niebuhr reflects on life, society, and his time as a pastor at a church.  That set the stage for a lifelong love of Niebuhr's way of thinking (if not always his particular conclusions), a love that is obviously shared by the theologian Robert McAfee Brown, the editor of this collection.  These essays are somewhat different in tone from the first book I read, but there is a consistency of spirit.  According to Brown, 'Niebuhr's resources in this sort of writing were always two: (1) the particular heritage of the Christian faith that he had appropriated, drawing especially on the Hebrew prophets, Jesus, Paul, the Reformation and Kierkegaard, and (2) a viewpoint in scrutinising the world around him not only in the light of this faith, but also with the tools of social science, political philosophy, and history that he acquired during his adult life.'<br /><br />Niebuhr's influences drew him into a prophetic ministry.  Prophetic ministry is not one in which the minister predicts the end of the world, but rather one in which the minister dares to speak the truth (and tells the consequences of such actions in no uncertain terms).  Thus, Niebuhr called upon the Christian community to be engaged in the world.  One wants to be careful to not read into Niebuhr that he is going to automatically be a proponent of any kind of social or military action - Niebuhr resisted the isolationism of the American Christian community prior to the second world war, but might not be a particular advocate of Cold War and post-Cold War military engagements such as we have now.  After all, in the same essay in which Niebuhr argues against a general pacifist view, he also states, 'A simple Christian moralism is senseless and confusing.  It is senseless when, as in the World War, is seeks uncritically to identify the cuase of Christ with the cause of democracy without a religious reservation.'<br /><br />Niebuhr's work is very good at identifying the tensions in which Christians must live - the tension between following prophetic calls and being good stewards, between love and judgement, between righteousness and mercy.  He identifies dangers in the prevalence of the secular culture, including its influence in the church itself.  The paradox of the search for meaning and the ubiquitous nature of mystery is one that guides an early essay in this collection, also paradoxically named, 'Pessimistic Optimism'.<br /><br />Niebuhr also looks at the Jewish-Christian relationship over time, and draws conclusions helpful for the bettering of relations for the future.  He is distrustful of supersessionist views by Christians toward the Jewish people and culture.<br /><br />This is an important collection of Niebuhr's thoughtebuhr resisted the isolationism of the American Christian community prior to the second world war, but might not be a particular advocate of Cold War and post-Cold War military engagements such as we have now.

The accumulation of a lifetime of anguish comes on, amazingly over a short period of six years. At 82, Kurt Vonnegut has successfully organized his experiences, beliefs, convictions, and perhaps dissapoinments, hurling them in literary bombs that evoke deep emotions...and where America is heading. <br /> <br />Contoversial points of view are well depicted in his previous books (beginning in 1999), particularly \\"God Bless You Dr. Kevorkian (which may become the cornerstone of euthanesia in a decade), and \\"Slauterhouse Five\\". In his recent book, \\"A Man Without a Country\\", reflections, criticism, pessimism, and deep humor are incorporated in describing our culture.  <br /> <br />The mechanization of the human being without a conscience (without a soul) resonates throughout the book as the bases of his argument. The writng is bold and cleverly interwoven with the thought process, which one may agree or not, depending on personal views. While his premise on \\"lack of concience\\" is on target, the reasonong of who these people are, remains in the eye of the beholder. <br /> <br />An exciting book with vacillating cultural references.	2005-10-09

Why am I biased? Well, I graduated in Education 30 years ago with a Philosophy and Euro Lang major [I've gone on to Jurisprudence, Electronic Engineering and Science studies as well, just for 'balance'...] This book hasn't changed my life at all, but it DOES give me hope for the future. <br /> <br />About 35 years ago, as a new undergraduate who'd wasted a good part of his youth reading philosophy books, I formulated a particular thesis about people's RIGHTS to their opinions...and had a lot of unsatisfying discussions with people I loved and whose support I wanted and needed. It wasn't much fun feeling, even \\"knowing\\" I was *correct* and yet alienating those people who were closest to me. <br /> <br />I was overjoyed to read Chapter 1 of Whyte's book, which stated my thesis so much better than a glib 20-year-old could have done, all those years ago. Try to remember, too, that many of my closest friends were influenced by 'New Age' and 'Hippie' thinking, back then...[Some of them still are...they don't recognize any of the well-established laws and limitations of nature to this day...just for example, in several cases \\"LSD logic\\", magazine horoscopes, certain dubious 'eastern-style' religions or even belief in visiting extra-terrestrial aliens are major features of their lives...]  <br /> <br />The people to whom I referred mostly belong to the generation of \\"baby boomers\\" that are now retiring from the work-force in droves and becoming the supposedly older, wiser folks, the parents and grand-parents of the present youth of the planet, but must include, as well, the generation or two before that. I'm now a grand-dad of four, myself...we're talking about at least five human generations here, more than a century of human existence, people! <br /> <br />Whyte's work is not a text-book on Logic. It's just a short, but well over-due book about fallacies that can help people to start thinking correctly once again [if they've just forgotten how] or to begin to analyze therubbish, the 'infotainment' and the commercial and political hype that we all face every day.  <br /> <br />PS: One could do worse than reading Carl Sagan's \\"The Demon-Haunted World--Science as a Candle in the Dark\\". I believe his 'Baloney-detector' covers virtually the same ground as Whyte's book, but in shorter fashion, with concomitant extra benefits.	2005-10-09

There are only a few cap makers among the younger generation of weavers and most senior basketmakers are no longer weaving caps. Many weavers never become sufficiently accomplished to weave caps. The theme of this exhibition, the woven cap, is the result of the need to examine the most challenging of twined baskets and to accentuate their significance. Woven basket caps are the pinnacle of closed-work twined basketmaking. The love of caps and the exchange of ideas between art historian Ron Johnson, basketmaker Susan \\"Tweet\\" Burdick, and basket expert Coleen Kelley Marks inspired this exhibition. Tweet commented to the author last summer at a Karuk Flower Dance that there are so few weavers of basket caps that in the future there may not be enough for the ceremonial dances. Coleen Kelley Marks and Ron Johnson chose the theme of woven caps and limited the exhibition to known weavers. Each weaver's accomplishments are emphasized through introductions and interviews in which their caps and the processes of weaving and gathering are discussed.	2005-10-09

Readers who like a little subversion with their science fiction, however, will find much to recommend this book. In her first novel, Mitchell has taken the most tawdry tropes of space opera -- women of Earth abducted to serve strange alien masters! beautiful hypersexual slave girls! robots with souls! -- and transformed them into a story whose value is far more than simple erotica.   <br />  <br />The cover tells you everything and nothing: a world whose sky might always be that sunset moment when the clouds have just caught fire, the streets and spires of an unfamiliar city, and the woman who runs. This is Elizabeth, and the city is Iyakk. The world is Vandhaqa, and Elizabeth is Taiyiha, human, female, enslaved to the enigmatic Adhal and their obedient automata, the Usahar. Like the other Taiyiha, she knows by heart both the epics of the Adhal and the Taiyiha's own laments; like them, she prays for the night when she will see Earth's moon rise and know that she is home; like them, she lives in shame and desire of what she has become. But unlike them, she has fallen in love: with a man who is no man, the Usahar XL176092, and their love will become the stuff of epic.  <br />  <br />Far from a simplistic love-conquers-all fairytale, Mitchell has created a skillful exploration of myth, truth, and fantasy. The Usahar opens on the premise that the reader already knows this tale -- or at least the one moment that has been alchemized into myth and common knowledge, Elizabeth's legendary run through the streets of shining Iyakk. Pay close attention to the narrative voice. By the novel's close, the oral tradition that has assimilated Elizabeth and XL176092 may be as crucial to the story as Elizabeth and XL176092 themselves. Life on Vandhaqa, meanwhile, is deconstructed from its initial appearance as a bondage fantasy into something much subtler and harder-edged. Sex on Vandhaqa may be free from the normal concerns of pregnancy and infection, but that does not mean it carries no consequences. \\"If I were destroyed,\\" Elizabeth thinks at one point, \\"it would be so much easier. If they would just make me nothing but sex . . . this wouldn't matter.\\" Mitchell's genius is that she knows: it still matters. <br /> <br />Karen Anne Mitchell's work may evoke such disparate classics as Tanith Lee's The Silver Metal Lover (Silver and XL176092 would have a lot to talk about) and the short fiction of Cordwainer Smith (see in particular \\"The Ballad of Lost C'mell\\" and \\"The Dead Lady of Clown Town\\"), but she has created a world entirely her own in Vandhaqa. It's not a place I'd like to live. I'm not even sure it's a place I'd like to visit. But I would certainly like to read more of its story: and The Usahar seems an ideal place to start.	2005-10-09

Her father died fighting in the French Resistance. Her mother and stepfather, both Russian exiles living in France, fled to New York in the early 1940's, and used their extraordinary energy and creativity to successfully re-invent themselves. Francine grew up surrounded by glamour and celebrity that those of us who grew up in the drab midwestern heartland can only dream about--or read about in Vogue, where Liberman's smart art direction gave ordinary Americans a peek into the lives of  people more rich, beautiful and famous than they could ever hope to be.<br /><br />Paradoxically, despite being taste-makers, the Libermans never overcame their sense of being outsiders in American society. Gray shows us the desolation beneath their extraordinary personal facades and the toll it took on her as a child and young adult. She writes about the physical dislocation her parents endured during the Russian Revolution and World War II and  their perpetual mourning for a vanished past. Gray writes about Freud's essay Mourning and Melancholia in terms of her grief about her father's death. Her mother and stepfather were going through their own unresolved mourning that psychologically crippled them. Gray evokes a now-vanished era in mid-20th century New York. Her portrait of her parents is an eloquent remembrance of their complex lives.	2005-10-09

Clarke handled his work on Mikhail Tal quite well, and despite the fact that Tal and Petrosian had vastly different styles, he manages to write on both with the same quite high quality.  <br />The book progresses through his career in just the right, methodical way for a subject who was known for his dedicated climb to the top, and resolute retention of the world title. The anotation is excellent, and although I can see how the notation may be slightly dense for those a little unfamiliar with works on chess, I think this book easily merits 4 stars. I would have preferred a little less focus on the very early years, but otherwise the high quality publishing would have earned it a fifth star as well.	2005-10-09

A Must read!	I just fininshed this book today and I am going to reread it again all over again just to feel myself immersed in the world of Memnon once more!   I read fiction and fantasy as a young black youth and it has always been a love of mine.  At one point I stopped reading fantasy books because I guessed at the time that I outgrew them.  Later in life I began rethinking history, the bible and everything fed to my mind from a child onward about myself, my (multidimensional) culture and where I fit into the grand scheme of world developement.  Because of this, I now realize that I lost interest in fantasy works, even on TV, because there were NO black men or women or children in leading roles period.  I also realize that not too many African Americans on a whole are inclined to read fantasy or fiction and what is read is usually what is pushed in the main market:  Books about cheating, the oversexed female, thugs to millionaires and so on, but nothing to really spark the imagination. <br /> <br />   As I began to study trance, stories and how they can unconsciously structure the personality of the reader or listener, making information easier to process and integrate, I searched all over the net for black fiction writers of fantasy bnecause I have just about had my fill of non-fiction books on just information.  I began to feel, thanks to observing my wife and how much she reads and has more spark to her, that I was sacrificing my true portal to the spirit within, my imagination.  My wife is a bookaholic when it comes to fiction and I am greasing the old gears to fire up that inner vision again.  But the books I have read or try to just don't do it.  THIS book does!  It could be because of the many authors and writings from other cultures as well as my own dealing with esoteric and spritual knowledge, but the ACTION and image-creating language in this book has awakened that inner vision!! <br /> <br />  It is my goal now to acquire all books in the series because I KNOWthe power of stories and Myths and how they can build and hold together the minds of a family/culture in spirit, in the dream worlds.  I am hooked on this book because as a black man, this charachter spoke directly to me for a change!  I wasn't just a spectator, I was Memnon!  Very empowering!  I may even begin to write myself, why not?  If you are black especially, but of any culture GET THIS BOOK!  Memnon is African yet he experiences many different cultures and evils, evil has no color preference so this book is not about Black over White, but for the black male searching for a hero to identify with this is it!	2005-10-09

I tired of looking up those words in the dictionary and just focused on the parts I could understand. <br />Mr. Harris is much smarter than me. He wrote the book as an intellectual writing for intellectuals. Most of the \\"masses\\" are the problem with religion, not being willing to study their own religions and others seriously and find the obvious faults and lies. <br />Hr. Harris did a fine job of telling the truth. Yet the people that need to know the stupidity of blind faith will never read End of Faith except for religious icons to tell their flock not to read the book. <br />But, having said that, Mr. Harris's book is the best written to combat faith whether people like myself can understand all of it.

While I believe there is an important rationale for a book like this (to evaluate colleges based on their left-wing bias or lack thereof), this edition was somewhat short of the mark. <br /> <br />First, it doesn't rate many colleges, only 110.  Second, it provides information more in narrative than in factual ratings which make it seem more biased than it may actually be.  Lastly, it's focus is the Humanities and Political Atmosphere but there is much more to college life that ought to be explored. <br /> <br />For Instance: <br /> <br />I really regretted that it did not have a better breakdown of dorm life.  Some \\"elite\\" schools not only require students to live in the dorms but then mandate that all dorms be co-ed (in some cases the ROOMS are co-ed).  It would be nice to rule out that kind of foolishness before wasting time on such a school. <br /> <br />Also, academic rigor can actually be measured by looking at grade inflation.  This book did not do that in any way that allows you to measure one school against another. <br /> <br />One thing I did like was a discussion of the crime situation at each campus.  Very good info for parents to consider. <br /> <br />The beauty of this kind of a guide is that they usually improve with later editions.  Let's hope so.	2005-10-09

The text is offered with the conviction that \\"understanding the religious beliefs, ethics and ritual practices of unfamiliar religions is imperative to preventing future acts of violence.\\"  I sense my socio-cultural paradigm has shifted since reading this book.  And I hope that my personal baby-steps toward a more careful handling of the involved issues can serve to further future prevention of violence in some way.<br /><br />While it is true that this book was written by a woman who is principally an academic, it's also true the research that went into it involved a great deal of field work and contact with law enforcement, victims and true believers themselves.<br /><br />Groups covered include various millenial religions, domestic terrorism groups (many of which mix component forms of Christian/pagan religious expression with extreme racial theories), international terrorist groups with an emphasis on violent Islamic groups, various Satanist groups, Vampirism, and syncretic belief systems such as Santeria and Voodoo.  Dr. Perlmutter then addresses various intelligence strategies for maximizing the public benefit of an informed investigative approach.  The book is also a wealth of resources for gaining additional information.  This dynamic field of study is difficult to set in print as though it were some sort of unchanging holy text, and the author acknowledges ongoing development.<br /><br />The book is not alarmist, but does raise concerns.  Crimes incidental to the practice of ritual violence covered in the book range from mild trespassing and littering issues through threats and assaults to violent crimes against persons including homicide.  The cases are well-documented and photographs and illustrations are plentiful.  This is not a coffee-table book; the photographs and symbols (germane to the topic, always) can be unpleasant.  While there are those who find any expression of intolerance to be small-minded, social intolerance of crime - especially violent crime - is both sensible and lawful.  One man's xenophobia is another man's kidnapping and cannibalism.<br /><br />While the author's initial area of academic expertise was art symbolism and religious art, she has become an expert in the related field of physical evidence of ritual violence.  For many practitioners of violent religious expression I suppose, their holy places are superior to the best available sacred art.  Her book has grown out of her law enforcement consulting experiences, not the other way around.

Grene states in her introduction to the 1959 edition that she probably needs a chapter on Tillich as well; her conclusion in the text about the incompatibilities of existentialism and Christianity need to be modified in light of his work.<br /><br />'Existentialism is the philosophy which declares as its first principle that existence is prior to essence.'  Kierkegaard and Heidegger both construct a metaphysics along these lines; for many of the existentialist, it leads to a bleak knowledge of the world devoid of values, that some find differents ways to escape - Kierkegaard and Marcel go back to concepts of God, whereas others like Sartre carry the despair itself as a primary motif.<br /><br />Grene looks at the political, social, metaphysical, epistemological and ethical implications of existentialism, as well as the main areas of overlap between the major thinkers.  This is an introductory text, so Grene does not explore the areas of difficulty as much as could be done, but for an introduction, such considerations can be left for later research.  This book does assume some familiarity with philosophy generally - Grene uses terminology without providing a glossary that the reader unfamiliar with philosophy might find difficult.<br /><br />As the twenty-first century dawns, existentialism has fallen somewhat out of favour, but it has yet to be replaced by any particular school of thought.  Philosophy in the present and future will have to take into account the ideas and developments of the existentialists regardless of whether or not they agree.  This is a good text for those beginning to explore existentialism, even after fifty years since it was written.d future will have to take into account the ideas and developments of the existentialists regardless of whether or not they agree.

Therefore, instead of criticizing, I would rather focus this review on the strengths, of which there are many, of this book. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Kaplan stresses that foreign policy should be based on a realistic appraisal of human nature. He points out that before the first president was sworn in, the rules of impeachment were established. He points to the work of James Madison who felt that men are so far beyond redemption that the only solution is to set ambition against ambition, and interest against interest. <br /> <br />Kaplan points out that the evils of the twentieth century arose from populist movements that were exploited and amplified by technologies. His example are the Nazis and Bolsheviks who, once in power, used industrial technologies to maintain power and commit crimes.  He warns that today populist movements permeate the world. These movements can disrupt social order as well as change political and economic structures. Currently these populist movements are fueled with religious zealotry and computer age technology.  These movements are inflamed by the injustices that capitalism naturally produces.  <br /> <br />Kaplan challenges Western policymakes who assert that ethnic and religious unrest is caused by political oppression by pointing out that it is political freedom that often unleashes violence. Peacemaking requires centralization of power. The historic truth is that democratizations is a long process before infrsstructures stabilize. To those who assert that democratic processes in Arabian Middle-East will faciliate peace with Israel, Kaplan would say 'think again' since liberalization may unleash fanantic anti-Israeli forces. Insistence on democratic elections in areas of the world without the dialogue of the Enlightenment is asking for trouble. He reminds us that national boundaries, for example Iraq, were drawn by European colonialists and these boundaries have yet to disintegrate under the forces of ethinic, religious, and geographic forces. As the developing world becomes more urban, he warns us that battlefields of the future will be urban. Terrorists and cybercriminals will use a vast range of atrocities as their methods of combat. Kaplan points out that Saddam Hussein was willing to fight us with conventional weapons against our conventional weapons. Those that replace him will not be so foolish. When cultures fail to compete technologically, Syria and Saudi Arabia come to mind, their naturally agressive young males become tribal in thier violence. More iceberts ahead!  <br /> <br />Kaplan points out that mature statesmen, such as General George Marshall, sought not solutions but a dynamic process of resolution and moving on to the next conflict. Kaplan points out that the humanitarian eforts to rebuild Europe were really about containment of the Soviets. An example of realistic policy that can backfire is the approach to Hitler. He at first was seen as a pesty dictator and the re-armament of Germany was seen as a control on the Soviets, who under Stalin were proven to be murderers. It was not until Hitler's insane ambitions were fully realized that the shifts occurred and the anti-Communist Churchill formed an alliance with Stalin to destroy an incredible poison that had grown in Germany. <br /> <br />Kaplan agrees with Isaiah Berlin's summary of Churchill: \\"Churchill's central organizing principle of his moral and intellectual universe is a histroic imagination so comprehensive as to encase the whole of the present and the whole of the future.\\"  Berlin saw Churchill's \\"strongest sense in the sense of the past...acquainted with the darkness.\\" Kaplan says that like all wise men, he thought tragically. Kaplan gives us a defense of Chamberlain since he built up Britain's defenses while testing Hitler's real intentions, which gained time and united public opinion behind the government for an eventual fight.  Kaplan sees our situation as similar to the late British Victorians who had to deal with 'nasty little wars in anarchic corners of the world.' <br /> <br />After a review of Churchill's writings about his experiences in the Sudan, Kaplan turns to the works of Livy regarding Hannibal. Rome's victory in the Second Punic War, like America's in World War II, made it a universal power. Hannibal had the advantage of attacking an enemy morally exhauseted from this war. By the time the Roman Senate realized it had to act, war was the only choice. Kaplan and Livy point out that it was primitive democracy that made Rome a nation which Carthage was not. Thus Rome's political debates gave it stability which Kaplan says anticipates Machiavelli's assertion that successful states require a modest degree of turmoil for healthy political dynamics. Kaplan also relates Hannibal's defeat to Vietnam with \\"unwise leaders try to conquer too much, too far away.\\" <br /> <br />Kaplan turns to Sun-Tzu's concept that the 'highest excellence' is never having to fight, for battle signifies a political failure. Kaplan summarizes Sun-Tzu thus; \\"The best way to avoid war - the violent result of political failure - is to think strategically. Thus the strategic pursuit of self-interest is not a cold and amoral pseudo-science but the moral act of those who know the horrors of battle and seek to avoid them.\\" <br /> <br />Kaplan next turns to Thucydides' Peloponnesian War which he thinks may be the seminal work of international relations theory of all time, influencing Hobbes, Clausewitz, Kennan, and Kissinger. Thucydides' notion is that self-interst gives birth to effort and effort to options which was a corrective to the extreme fatilism of both Marxism and medieval Christianity. Athens and Spart came to war becuase of uncontrollable allies: a reason that Russia, Germany, France, and Britain went to war in 1914. Thucydides saw human behavior as guided by fear, self-interest,and honor, all of which can lead to war and instability. A political crises occurs when instincts and anarchy triumph over laws and politics. The solution is to manage fear, self-intersts, and honor. It is with Thucydides that the concept of the balance of power enters political thought. <br /> <br />Kaplan does a good job of connecting Thucydides's view of Athens with a view of the United States. Athens had no tragic sense of the future, thinking their greatness was destined forever, and thus thinking they could act without consequence. They were fearless and arrogant. Thus they lacked practical and prudent policy. Just as in Vietnam, Athenians ingnored signs of danger as they became more and more involved. Power and affluence blinded the Athenians. Kaplan says the lesson is that the more socially and economically advanced the times, the more necessary it is for leaders to maintain a sense of their societie's fallibility and vulnerability. <br /> <br />Kaplan summarizes this discussion by asserting that groups will be in competition and thus states must maintain maneuverability. States act good or bad as they maneuver for advantage. \\"Historically grounded liberalism recognizes that liberty did not arise from abstract reflection ... but from difficult political choices made by rulers acting on self interest.\\"	2005-10-09

I do not personally like the way the commentary is set up as it just goes in brackets in the middle of the text. The commentary itself is outstanding however, clarifying many issues and even relating to the rulings of other madhabs on occasion (this book is for the Shafi'i madhab). The appendices are worth the price of the book by themselves and deal with many of the pressing issues of the day. The book looks attractive and unlike many recent books I have bought, it seems very well bound. Overall it is a great achievment that should not be overshadowed be the Reliance.	2005-10-09
US	36254535	R12PGNN4R9CBEI	0310363810	397609023	Cultural Anthropology	Books	3	9	11	N	Y	A Christian Perspective	Cultural Anthropology is an introductory book written by two Christian anthropologists for Christian missionaries and pastors.  The sub-title declares after all that it is a \\"Christian Perspective.\\"  Grunlan and Mayers have taken various insights which they have learned from studying anthropology and have applied it to the Christian context.  They have correctly noted the usefulness of anthropological study for the task of missions in particular and any cross-cultural encounter in general.   <br /> <br />One of the most helpful contributions this book provides is its discussion of Cultural Relativity in relation to Biblical Authority.  Cultural relativity is achieved when one recognizes that no two cultures are alike and that those differences do not necessarily constitute matters of validity or non-validity.  The rightness of wrongness of culture cannot be determined solely by comparing it with another culture.  This recognizes that every culture has problems and no culture is superior to the other.  Yet, if one held only to cultural relativity than one would slide deep into a morass of relativism.  Everything in every culture would become acceptable and right.  <br /> <br />It is here where it becomes necessary to recognize the authority of the Bible.  Biblical absolutes help ground cultural relativity.  In fact, biblical authority is the bedrock foundation upon which cultural relativity is built.  Biblical authority shows that there are some things within culture and transcending culture which are wrong.  Scripture is the ultimate authority in matters of right and wrong.  Every culture and every cultural practice must be weighed by the teaching of Scripture.  Therefore, \\"each culture defined the situation (cultural relativity), but it was on the basis of the biblical principles (biblical authority) that the action was evaluated\\" (260).  Such recognition of biblical authority keeps cultural relativism in check.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book suffered fromwhat I thought were some basic shortcomings which affected its usefulness.  First, throughout the book, there is a quiet tendency to drift more toward cultural relativism than toward biblical authority.  Of course, this is after all a fine line and I am sure that no one can walk it without falling, yet I do believe that Grunlan and Mayers were in danger of falling off in numerous places.  While for the most part I agree with their understanding of cultural relativity and biblical authority I don't think we should hold to it to tightly.  There are many times where the Bible may not specifically speak to an issue and yet one culture may have a better way than the other.  Cultural relativity can tend to smack of arrogance in saying that both cultures are right.  What actually needs to be done is for both cultures to have a willingness to listen and learn from each other.  There may be some things that are \\"culturally relative\\" but should none the less be changed for the better of the culture. <br /> <br />One of things that what most annoying in reading this book is that for most chapters it read like a dictionary with examples.  They would define a term and then provide a few examples from some preliterate culture and then define another term along with more examples.  There didn't seem to be much of a critical evaluation of the terms they were borrowing from secular anthropology.  Maybe the inclusion of more in-depth case studies would have proven more helpful than just brief illustrations of the definitions they provided.  One can quickly get bogged down in trying to remember what endogamy, proximic communication, sororate marriage, and phratry are.  Thankfully they at least provided a glossary of terms at the back. <br /> <br />Despite a lot of the profuse vocabulary the book remained rather readable.  The illustrations helped move the book along, but after a while they grew tiresome.  I would have enjoyed them using more illustrations from western and Middle Eastern countries along with the smaller tribal communities which they primarily used.   <br /> <br />This book is written for a selective audience.  Those interested in tribal missions in particular and those who have an interest in other cultures would benefit from reading this work.  I honestly question its usefulness for pastors who already know the culture in which they minister.  Yet, for the missionary it does help awaken their eyes to be prepared for what they are about to step into when they first get off that plane and enter into a new culture.	2005-10-09

If you do not understand why anyone would leave a high paying, high profile job writing speeches for a person whom most would agree was the most powerful person in the world to go build a boat, then you should not read this book. You will not get it. If the corporate ladder holds no glory for you, then this is your book. <br /> <br />I give the author a lot of credit for having the nerve to do what most money hungry Americans would never understand. Pollack had a dream to build a boat of corks since he was a little boy. Now at the age of 34 he had decided to follow his dream, a crazy idea at best. Nevertheless, he chose to follow his dream. I wish I had his guts. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this to anyone that has ever had a crazy dream and is too scared to go for it. Pollack should be an inspiration to us all. Thankfully, he is also a witty and interesting writer. jay. <br />	2005-10-09

The young specialty of hospitalist is one that has needed its own dedicated text for some time.  This second edition is definately it.  While there is still some slight fine tuning to be done, Dr. Wachter continues to do great work for us as the Father of the Hospitalist Revolution that is occuring.   <br />It goes without saying that Hospital Medicine is essential to the library of every Hospitalist, but should also be required reading by all Internists, FPs, and IM residents.  This book brings together the various aspects of inpatient medcine from nutrition to the business of medicine to procedures and perioperative care.  There are also very nice sections on critical care and cardiovascular disease as well as the vital role of consultation.  My highest reccomendation.	2005-10-09

I think she rambled a lot and I took issue with a few of the things she wrote as if she were an expert when really they are just her opinion. [...] Darla has a different style that I think offends more people than does the good that I think she seeks to do.  Some women may need to read it in this tone but I didn't.  To each his own.  The bottom line is that I mostly agree with her, I just took issue with the presentation at times.    After a few days, I have to add something to what I've said.  I still hold to what I wrote above but I must confess that I've heard Darla's voice in my head over the past few days inspiring me to *try* to cook for my family.  And also to bond with my house.  Since I've never looked at it that way before, those appear to be the words I needed.  I just had to come back and give her some credit because she has had an impact in my life after reading the book.  Also, if you need some guidance in the real brass tacks of being a housewife, I would recommend picking up a copy of Sink Reflections by Marla Cilley.  It will give you some excellent details that some of us need to be told because we didn't get it when we were at home with Mom...	2005-10-09

As I started, all the talk of religeon, miracles and spirits was a bit much for a supposedly true family history.  The more I read, the better it got.  The history of how Mr. Villasenor's grandparents came to America and met is an epic of love, transcendence and overcoming odds.  If you can make it past page 20, you won't put it down.<br /><br />It would have been very easy for this to be a whitewashed view of the world.  Instead, the author confronts some of the darker sides of his family history.  Many relatives spent time in jail.  Grandpa was a bootlegger.  Many of his great-aunts and uncles were jealous at the best of times, and awful at the worst.  Yet somehow a great story emerges.<br /><br />I can only imagine the effort required to produce this book.  Mr. Villasenor, your effort was well worth it.	2005-10-09

After months of studying, U.S. Marshal Gillian Logue finally has her first field assignment.  This is the assignment that will help her prove to her overprotective father and three older brothers that she is capable enough to do something with her life besides becoming a wife and mother.  Of course, the man she is sent to protect is exceedingly reclusive, and has been ever since the murder of his wife.  Finally tracing him to an island he owns off the Oregon coast, which just happens to be very close to where Gillian grew up, Gillian is dropped off there with a tent and enough supplies to last her two weeks.  She has to watch this man and protect him for two weeks until the trial of the drug lord who killed his wife. <br /> <br />Ever since his wife was murdered, Joe Morgan has lived his life on the run.  In order to protect his daughter, he left her with her maternal grandparents in Los Angeles, knowing they have the money to keep her safe.  Of course, if Joe hadn't gotten involved in this case to begin with, his wife never would have been murdered and he would still have his family.  It's been two years now and Joe still holds himself responsible.  He finally ended up here on his island off the Oregon coast with only his daughter's dog for company, which is how Joe wants it. <br /> <br />When Joe finds Gillian on his island, he can't believe it and is ready to run again.  Constantly fighting the attraction between them, Gillian eventually begins tearing the down the walls Joe has erected. <br /> <br />Will Gillian be able to prove herself with this assignment?  Will the two of them fight the attraction, or eventually give into it?  Will Joe ever get over the loss of his wife and be reunited with his daughter?  Will Gillian be able to keep Joe safe and deliver him to the trial? <br /> <br />SAVING JOE is a wonderful story of dealing with loss and bitterness.  Laura Marie Altom has done a wonderful job of bringing her characters to life, including all the baggage they've been carrying.  We have Joe dealing with the guilt of his wife's murder and trying to reconcile himself to her loss.  On the other hand, we have Gillian dealing with her feelings of never being good enough to do what she wants with her life.  Not only do these two individuals deal with each other's baggage, they're also surrounded by danger.  This is a wonderful little story, complete with heartfelt sigh at the end and I highly recommend reading it.  <br />	2005-10-09

Not for those who feel bitter about their helplessness in an increasingly capitalist world. Not for those who are refugees to a new country or those on welfare...But it is a good book for those of us lucky enough to be in a position to take control of our destinies and for those of us who have resigned to the fact that hell we live in a capitalist/consumer society and what we do does define us. We spend most of our waking life at work so what we do is very important. <br /> <br />For critics who say that this book is just for rich people - this is a little too defeatist. I was a bottom middle income earner who was possibly on the way up to being a middle middle income earner, when I just realised my job was not for me and that it was making me miserable. I downsized considerably, changed my lifestyle and gave myself the time to explore other options. I found this book inspiring because there were other people who were in similar situations. While my aspirations may not be to build a multimillion dollar cosmetic industry, this book has affirmed my decision to make these changes for myself. <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is thinking about making some life changes. <br /> <br />I also recommend this book to aspiring writers. While some people may find Po's rants narcissistic, many people chasing their personal dream will find that his story really resonates with them. <br /> <br />Good luck.	2005-10-09

For instance, oh, I don't know - the printing press?\\" <br /> <br />RESPONSE: <br />Guttenberg invented the printing press in 1454.  The Protestant Reformation occurred October, 1517, 63 years later.  Ergo, the first Bible printed - Gutenberg's - was the Catholic Bible as compiled by the Catholic Church around 400 ad.  The Catholic Bible included Tobias, Judith, Baruch, Ecclesiasticus, Wisdom, 1 & 2 Machabees in the Old Testament.  Martin Luther removed them in the 16th century (1100 years after the Catholic Church compiled the Bible).  He also removed part of the New Testament: James, the epistles of John, Hebrews, etc.  But as time progressed, the Protestants restored the New Testament as the Catholic Church had originally compiled it.  The Old Testament books, removed by Luther, were not restored. <br /> <br />You will note that they are not in the current Protestant Bibles (unlike the Gutenberg Bible that includes them).  1600 years after the Catholic Church compiled the first Bible, they remain in the Catholic Bible.  (This defeats the notion that the Catholic church \\"added\\" them.  As a matter of historical fact, Luther \\"removed\\" them.  Just look at the first printed Bible: Gutenberg's). <br /> <br />Catholic culture extends back 2000 years.  Protestant culture (which, by nature, is not harmonious) extends back less than 500 years. <br /> <br />QED <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

Books	1	19	22	N	N	DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS BOOK	Reading this book made me feel physically sick.    Why? Because I know that business, commerce, share and property trading are complex, constantly-evolving and often technical subjects.    This book is a simplistic story, seemingly an auto-biography, that it took me an afternoon to read.    I hated the style of the book. If I want to read about wealth creation, then please give me weath-creation, not a story about the good old days in Hawaii.    It made me shudder to think of all the poor folk out there who would like to know how to make money, who might think this could show them how.    As I said, if you are a child and know nothing about the meaning of assets or liabilities, this could illustrate to you the basic concept.    However, alot of people seem to find the interpretation of even those simple concepts flawed.    If you have even any passing familiarity with economic/business concepts, I can't see this helping you at all.    I would see a subscription to a business/money/finance magazine as being of much greater value to an adult as these generally will tell you of techniques to actually try making money rather than just vague principles.    Yes, we would all like to put our money into appreciating assets and live off the passive income, but I don't see that happening in a hurry for anyone but an exceptionally lucky few.    Having said all of that, this book and the whole rich dad/poor dad series is cleverly marketed, but that doesn't make it a good book, it just adds to my sense of nausea about it.    Because the book is so non-specific and basic, it is successfully marketed around the world.    An example being that I bought it in a thrift shop here in Australia, read it in an afternoon and then sold it for a few dollars more.    I guess that's about the sum value of this book.    I'd suggest anyone interested in this book should do some research and read some of the less-than-glowing reviews - they are alot closer to the mark than the hundreds of five-star reviews on Amazon.

There is much that is good in it and it is solidly Catholic. But I don't think it \\"hits the mark\\" for the majority of faithful Catholic women today, that is those who do not fit the model of Mrs. Martin. The main point of disparity is that most Catholic women do not have faithful Catholic husbands, like Mrs. Martin does, who function as the spiritual heads of the households. So much in this book is founded on the premise that they do.<br /><br />She makes a point in one chapter about how astounded someone was to hear all five of her children had the same father.  I wondered at that point about the women reading the book who haven't come from such a wonderful past as she, who have made serious mistakes, whose children do not all have the same father, yet still want to be \\"women of grace\\". There was nothing in the book about coming out of an imperfect past (and haven't we all really?), finding forgiveness and striving to become the women of grace God wants us to be.<br /><br />I also found the format difficult to deal with. Maybe I'm just not the \\"write in the answers\\" type of person, but I really did not like so many questions with simple, one-word answers. The book is not really a Bible study, but a Bible-referenced topical presentation.	2005-10-09

Finally this legendary mistress of Charles II has a biographer who knows his subject and can bring her to life.  My advice is to grab a copy and settle into a comfortable chair and surrender to the capable hands of this brilliant young writer.  Beauclerk's sharp eye never overlooks a significant detail and his ever-present sense of humor never misses the chance to share a smile or a laugh.   <br />    And when the inevitable movie comes out, you will say with conviction: \\"Oh, but you should really read the book!\\" <br />	2005-10-09

I just spent the last 10 minutes reading or skimming through the 60-some reviews on here.  Interesting to note that most people either love or hate the book.  Personally I love it.  When I read I find myself tearing up over various issues that fully resonate with my heart.  I also promise you that I am not your typical 'gushy', chick-flick watching female.  To be honest, i'm much more tomboyish and struggle to be feminine instead of 'tough'. But I believe God plants in woman many universal core desires and that is what 'Captivating' addresses.  I give this book 4 stars and am going to explain why by addressing issues OTHER people had with the book's content.<br /><br />A warning, this could be long. I love to write.  I beg your indulgence.<br /><br />First off..the title of the book, 'Captivating'.  I saw one review that claimed this title is negative and implies men being captives of women.  How misunderstood!  In my evening Bible-reading, I came across this verse in Proverbs(5:18.19) 'May you rejoice in the wife of your youth...may you ever be CAPTIVATED by her love.'  So yes, for the record, being captivating is very Biblical.<br /><br />Secondly, comments about the 'over-use' of movie references and pop-culture.  I've noted that much of our Christian culture has always been AFRAID of popular entertainment.  I agree that there is a great necessity for discernment, but at the same time, we must address society WHERE IT IS.  This book does not seek to REPLACE the Bible, but to encourage us to see God in everyday things.  How many of us never go to the movies or listen to the radio or read classic literature?  very few indeed.  Is it really so terrible to draw truth from fiction?  Fiction is not synonmous with lies,  yet some still chose to believe this.  God is the author of our creativity..our desire to spin tales for entertainment.  We shouldn't shun that.<br /><br />In order to avoid writing a book instead of a book review, I'm just going to address one final concern..one that holds more reason for concern.  Eldredge's books do tend to lack 'meat'.  Not to say they are faulty -- the books NEVER make claim to replace the Bible or other quality non-fiction.  All i'm saying is that it's true that while a huge portion of his books will be easy to relate to, sometimes one walks away being unsure of answers.  And this is my main concern and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  However, if this book is studied WITH the Bible, I believe that it will be a blessing and a source of healing instead of emotional 'fluff'.<br /><br />This book will likely resonate with certain personality types more than others.  In my experience, it touches more of the expressive/creative types than those who are blatantly practical.  That's ok.  There is no one cure-all book, and 'Captivating' is NOT for everyone.  However it does speak great truth about hurt and healing to those who will listen.  And I encourage women and their husbands,boyfriends, brothers in Christ to read this book without prejudice and to see what God teaches.<br /><br />God bless.al concern..one that holds more reason for concern.

Max Weber (1864-1920) had noticed that Protestants appeared excessively under the numbers of people who economically were successful. The Catholicism seemed to make it easier (due to an integrated sin pardon mechanics) to enjoy life in between times. The Mediterranean countries have saved this as a differentiable lifestyle till nowadays, but particular the Nordic, by the majority Protestant countries put the human beings into a hermetic box of duty fulfillment and responsibility. The suicide installment is also higher in these areas: Unfortunately, Luther's theological revolution was not namely a liberation, no reduction of control but its millionfold multiplication: In the end everyone became the merciless inspector of himself. The reformation has increased the pressure extremely. Now mixed religious aims and working actions were bound each other with the visibility of financial success. Other religions, the Buddhism, the Islam etc., seem strikingly less in conformity with the capitalism in this regard. On the contrary: Being obstinate or disinterested seem to be transported rather. The Calvinistic capitalism on the other hand produces (besides all superficial correctness) a subtle social coldness, a fight of everybody against everybody, which promotes the assumption, that there is not enough space in the paradisiacal sky for everyone at all. Therefore the fear of being not preferred later on by the dear God starts a hitting and fighting between the human beings vehemently. Being religious in this manner has not contributed to humanness, but, instead, made some steps backward globally, regarding the great individual sovereignty, which the renaissance man already had achieved. Face of the fact, that (at the moment) a second theocracy seems to spread himself apparently in the USA -- at least in the opinion of the ones who sit at the decisive Washington coordinating points -- in the face of such developments among the conservative Christians of the USA, which surpass many a nastiness of the frowned Machiavellism or the elite oriented Darwinism, yes even the racism -- in view of such developments it seems recommended to examine the rational analyses of Max Weber again ...many a nastiness of the frowned Machiavellism or the elite oriented Darwinism, yes even the racism -- in view of such developments it seems recommended to examine the rational analyses of Max Weber again ...  <br />	2005-10-09

Penman manages to create a great historical novel that dramatizes a difficult time in English history: the contest in the 12th C for the throne, pitting two cousins, Maude and Stephen, against each other.  Spanning several decades, `While Christ and His Saints Slept' (the title taken from an actual quote of the time) details the -- sometimes literal -- trials and tribulations of one extended family.  The death of the son of Henry I leaves a gap in the succession, one that the `old king' is determined to fill with his daughter Maude, the widow of the German Emperor.  Although England has no legal barring of women from the throne, there are few who would champion a woman's right to rule in this era.  Hence Stephen, a royal cousin, is picked by other factions to succeed Henry.  What follows rips England apart, dividing families and loyalties for over 20 years.  Penman really has a feel for the language and attitude of her characters; although Ranulf, a major player, is fictional, she uses his character to explore the attitudes of/for the Welsh, and as a way to describe the old king's many illegitimate children (many of whom were sons, as was the real Robert, Earl of Gloucester, Maude's half-brother).  Fictional or factual, the author paints a clear picture of the characters: Maude, who is intelligent enough to rule, but her pride destroys any hope of peace with her in power; Stephen, a good man, but a bad king; Robert, who could have, if he were legitimate, ended any succession problems; Matilda, Stephen's wife, whose strength helps keep Stephen in power; Willem de Ypres, a mercenary for Stephen who is a voice of reason unheard; and Ranulf, a young boy at the beginning of the novel who finds himself in the thick of most of the major events in Maude and Stephen's struggle, and who retires fromhistory to Wales. The Afterward relates the history to the fiction, and it may surprise some readers to find that some of the more fantastic episodes in the book actually happened;  for example, at one point, Maude makes a daring winter escape from a castle dressed in white to match the snow: her successful escape drags the conflict on for several years.  A good novel; I would definitely read other books by this author.	2005-10-09

While `other' people toiled away in minimum wage positions, we were being assured job security and lots of perks to boot. College graduates were guaranteed a place in that company until their retirement from the company. They had made it in the world---or so they thought.<br /><br />Economic realities are delivering an abrupt wake-up call.<br /><br />In American society, making a profit is the bottom line of any corporation. This pursuit has recently led to layoff of white-collar workers in record numbers. The `downsized' workers had not done anything wrong except for being on the company payroll when it was trying to cut every corner imaginable.<br /><br />Now many of the same workers who had assumed they would not need or even supported policies which attacked social services are finding themselves having to use them. It is disorienting for these people to recognize they need to apply for public assistance and other programs which were once presumed to exist for `lazy freeloaders'. They are quickly trying to return to the White Collar world, but finding those jobs are much easier said than done.<br /><br />Smelling blood in the water, a veritable cottage industry of consultants and agencies opened up to theoretically help the newly-unemployed regain their corporate footing. Ehrenreich says theoretically because otherwise then those companies themselves would be out of their jobs. Therefore, they systematically keep clients just hopeful enough that `only' if they do the right things will they be able to get a job. The all-critical catch is the seminar trainees are rarely able to do things as well as the trainer admonishes them to.  This bittersweet cycle is punctuated by the ever-perky organization staffs.<br /><br />I read this book while my own father and his peers are among many of those whose experiences are being described through the text. She never interviewed them, but Ehrenreich's words echo their experiences.  Who you know and then what those people can do for you is often more important to present-day job hunts than your prior education and/or job experiences combined. Finding a job occurs more through personal connection (the `friend of a friend' avenue) than employment agencies or even reading the `classifieds' section of your local newspaper.<br /><br />The college transcript has decreased in importance, even though they are still used to some extent in order to screen job candidates in some cases. However, the book also expertly captures the paradoxical frustrations which many people-supposed to be America's `elite' are instead feeling. If they really had made it in American society, why do they have to look so thoroughly for any job (never mind the `dream') and worry about basic subsistence?<br /><br />In these respects, Ehrenreich's book is a logical extension of \\"Nickeled and Dimed\\". It illustrates that current American socioeconomic policies hurt most people and we will very soon be a nation of the very wealthy 5-10% while the majority will end up living in abject poverty despite our education, our skills, and/or work ethic.<br /><br />America's current national unemployment policies almost exclusively reference the working class because America does not want to admit that such a large percentage of its white collar workforce is vulnerable to being laid off. Pretending that downsizing only happens to `other' people in an already highly competitive economic class is much easier than admitting the system itself is long overdue for overhaul.<br /><br />Ehrenreich is a powerful writer specifically because she transforms `abstract' economic concepts into human interest stories---which connect with the readers. Her books are ultimately uplifting because while documenting current problems, she also foreshadows an America where those very problems are solved.  I'd recommend this book for public and college libraries. It is also an excellent comfort book for the white-collar worker and/or their families who are facing the circumstances described in this book.families who are facing the circumstances described in this book.	2005-10-09

And I support human rights for everyone.  But I know that it is not always easy for those whose rights are violated to get a hearing.  The powers that be may not be interesting in publicizing their complaints.  What is to be done?<br /><br />The answer is to find a way to speak out, and to get allies.  And this book could be part of such an effort.  Instead, it achieves the opposite effect.  The wrong allies have been chosen.  It is bad enough to choose tyrants as allies.  It is catastrophic to choose liars.<br /><br />It is a good idea to monitor our behavior.  But that requires honesty and accuracy, not mere transmission of anti-American propaganda.<br /><br />Since this book mentions American involvement in the Middle East, it would have been a good idea for it to find fault with our government's tolerance for and even support of opponents of human rights, including Arafat and his gang.  However, this book chooses to ignore Arafat's transgressions and find fault with Arafat's Israeli victims for building a separation fence to defend the lives of Israeli citizens!  And the book finds fault with the United States for supporting Israel's right to do this at the International Court of Justice.<br /><br />A book about human rights that includes such a gross moral error simply can't be trusted.  And those who wish to use such a book to air their grievances about transgressions of human rights thus lose an opportunity to be heard and taken seriously.	2005-10-09

How they get to know and support each other after their collective failure to jump off. How they try to get used and deal with the idea of each of them living on. It's all told in the first person with each of them taking turns to move the story on. There isn't that much of a story, the entertainment comes from Hornby using his characters as vehicles for bringing his views on things to you the reader. These views can be funny or insightful or both and because of the nature of the novel being suicide and depression and lack of hope- I found the book so intense that sometimes I HAD to put it down almost to allow myself to ingest the emotions before continuing the next day. Hornby has a terrific voice, knowledgeable and funny and he struggled now and then to keep HIS voice out of all the characters. There's no wasted pages, no filler material at all though the book does lose it's impetus a little as you get through it- I'm not sure if this was me getting used to the subject matter or if Hornby loses his way a bit. Luckily though, it was just good enough in the end to merit the five stars. Original, well written and an easy but intense read.	2005-10-09

Once the Reagan years had concluded, economic statistics showed major gains in the spending power of the wealthiest Americans. Perhaps this was one reason that millions of jobs were created and the value of the DOW Jones Industrial Average doubled during the Reagan years.  <br /> <br />There was another reason. Those same statistics showed a considerable growth in the spending power of the poorest Americans. Middle Class Americans received the same and the lower class in America shrunk considerably.  <br /> <br />By giving people more spending power, Reagan&#8217;s tax cuts allowed for all citizens, rich and poor, to contribute to the economic system. That was perhaps the fairest tax around. <br /> <br />The book asserts that HR 25 maintains the same tax (\\"is revenue neutral\\") and works counter to proven economic policy. <br />	2005-10-09

The reader meets Purvis, Cowley and Hoover from the fledgling FBI, crooked East Chicago cop Martin Zarkovich, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, Ma Barker and her boys and the infamous Lady In \\"Red\\" Anna Sage, as well as Dillinger and Frank Nitti. Although the book meanders off track briefly towards the middle, Collins captures the perfect blend of history, supposition and fiction to bring these figures to life and provides enough mystery with Heller's clients to make True Crime a highly entertaining read.	2005-10-09

I even loved the collaboration on the most recent book written by both mother and son. However, this recent book leaves a lot to be desired. The book was good, but it got very confusing with regards to the names of the characters. There were just too many people whose names were the same. I especially had problems with M'Hall and M'Tal (I think those names are right, anyhow). The book was fairly slow in spots as well.

This book explains unobvious ideas and get you up to speed in very short time. You will hardly find such books because most authors want to make the book as thick as possible to make more money. Most books target for a complete novice who wants to be a programmer from another field I think. Those authors may care more about the number of the books they sell than what the readers learn. The author of this book is a real teacher who wants you to learn something and he has a lot of experiences to show you. This book won't spend hundred of pages to show you how to define a variable, how to write a function or how to write a conditional statements.<br /><br />However, you need some basic experience in programming to understand the book.

As Children's Ministry Coordinator, I've searched endlessly for a good, long-term use, devotional/lesson book for my 5th/6th graders.  With ages ranging from 9 - 13, it's been hard finding a publisher who makes lessons that will appeal to everyone.  This one is great!  The devotions are quick and easy to prepare, incredibly doable on a tight budget (can I get an amen!?), and most importantly, FUN!  Devotions are divided into sections: \\"About Faith\\", \\"About Friends\\", \\"About Families\\", \\"About School\\", About MY World\\", About Special Days\\".  You can also search by scripture reference in the index or by theme.  Each devotion has a Title, theme, scripture reference, summary, preparation (you'll need), and body.    Instead of the same format again and again, inventive object lessons utilizine food, media, arts, discussion, independent work, action, and more to teach important ideas.  Some of my favorites include Power! (pg 8), Re-Paint-ance (pg 15), and Cash Stash (pg 60).  Power! is about the Holy Spirit's power in our lives, an invisible force moving us forward.  Kids will create a hovercraft out of plastic soda bottle necks and plastic foam bowls.  A quick puff into the mouth of the bottle and the bowl lifts up and floats along.  Re-paint-ance talks about - you guessed it - repentance.  Kids will paint over old paintings (from a thrift store or such).  In art circles, this is called \\"pentimento\\", an Italian term meaning \\"repentance.\\"  It describes the practice of painted over a pre-existing painting, showing that the artist ha changed his/her mind about the first painting.  Cash Stash accomplishes two things.  First, kids will discover whether they make tithing and giving a priority and second, it will teach them to budget their money.  Each kid (or group) gets a handful of Monopoly money or photocopies of the money printed in the book and instructions to make a budget for this money.  This is a definite MUST HAVE for all Sunday school programs with a preteen class.  You'll love it!	2005-10-09

Books	5	15	21	N	N	The Divine Authority of the Word of God	Anyone opening a book by Ken Ham must be prepared themselves to begin thinking. &#34;Why Won't They Listen?&#34; provides yet another marvelous study challenging the stupidity gagging the world of academia.  In this excellent expansion of earlier works devoted to expounding the infallible, inerrant, divinely inspired account of God's creation in Genesis, Ham exposes the world's growing acceptance of lies as science, and then follows up with scientific reality revealing the ignorance to which the world clings.  Lacking any empirical support for their religiously-based academics, evolutionists may be observed continuing down the path on the broad way leading to the destruction &#34;...of those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.&#34; {I Thessalonians 2:10, The New King James.}  Delving into various disciplines such as biology, history, archaeology and more, Ham demonstrates the foolishness of men that has confounded the wise in Christendom as to &#34;Why They Won't Listen.&#34;  Excellent prospects are unfolded by the author of future efforts to publicize all things discovered that some might be saved.  One of many delightful tidbits chronicled is the evolutionary paleontologist's recent discovery of dinosaur bones in Montana which contain blood cells. This evidence neatly destroys the possibility of millions of years of evolution while pointing clearly to a young earth of a few thousand. And of course noted are the Indian cave paintings described by evolutionists of the brontosaurus. Problematically, the Indian artwork is only hundreds of years old.  Australia's 'Honest Abe' has set himself on the noble course to return Holy Writ to it's original place of honor as the Divine Authority, the very Word of God.  His ministry also offers a treasure trove of books, dvd's, tapes and other source materials, available through his web site.  The entertaining Mr. Ham also supplies personal appearances where he ably displaysmany of the aspects of his decades of work to lighten this dark planet.  Those burned by other creation ministries that offer overpriced snippets of creation perspectives will be 'wowed' at Ham's jam-packed, runaway freight train delivery, forever captured on DVD to prove the Australian is unquestionably one of the fastest minds in the human race.  That performance can be found in, &#34;Genesis The Key To Reclaiming the Culture.&#34;  All of this because Mr. Ham recognizes the Divine Authority of God's Word.

They claim that inflation will hurt you worse. They say that inflation used to hurt because as you're income went up you would enter a higher tax bracket. The tax brackets were tied to the inflation rate to fix this problem. <br /> <br />The national sales tax does not charge you at a higher rate when you make more money. You always pay the same percentage. You pay more money in taxes, but you also do under the current system. The flat tax as well as the current income tax both tax you at the same percentage rate, regardless of inflation. <br /> <br />\\"The national sales tax is subject to manipulation in even more direct ways than the income tax has been. Let's say that Congress or some powerful regulatory agency decides that fatty foods or sugar or potato chips are bad for you &#8211; wham! Suddenly there might a 200 percent tax on those items.\\" <br /> <br />The federal government already can and does impose taxes on individual items. They usually call these luxury taxes or similar names. They tax alcohol and cigarettes this way as two examples. The national sales tax is no more subject to manipulation than our current system. <br /> <br />\\"Government won't have to ban firearms; they'll just place a 500 percent sales tax on them. Or a 1,000 percent sales tax on ammunition. Cigarettes?\\" <br /> <br />They've been trying to do that for a very long time now. We must be vigilant to prevent them from doing so, but a national sales tax doesn't increase that threat in any way. <br /> <br />\\"The tax will be used to track your entire financial life. While H.R. 25 does not contain any requirement that every purchase be linked to an individual's ID, the trend toward tracking every purchase is growing. We expect that eventually, your &#8220;national ID cash card&#8221; will be required when you buy anything.\\" <br /> <br />There is nothing in the proposed law that requires retailers to track who is buying what items, or for retailers that do track such data to provide that data to the government. <br /> <br />It is something we should be concerned about, but this law wouldn't do it, or even make it easier to do than it is now. <br /> <br />\\"A national sales tax will create a huge black market.\\" <br /> <br />Possibly. I'm not sure it will create a larger black market than there already is. There already is lots of tax evasion, and a market for items like cigarettes that don't have the federal tax stamp. The nature of tax evasion will change. In some ways it will be easier to combat, in other was harder. <br /> <br />The national sales tax would create a huge market for individuals selling used goods. If this looks like it might go through, it might be good to buy stock in Ebay. <br /> <br />\\"The national sales tax will give government another reason to make cash purchases illegal.\\" <br /> <br />Not really. They're pretty much the same reasons they have now. <br /> <br />\\"You'll pay a higher sum for your new home.\\" <br /> <br />There is a serious problem involved here, but I'm not sure it's with new homes. Builders wouldn't be paying the withholding taxes for their employees anymore. Their profits also wouldn't be taxed. <br /> <br />Therefore the cost of building a house goes way down. <br /> <br />The problem is that drastically depreciates the value of current homes. That means for people like me, for whom their house is their largest investment, we take a HUGE hit. <br /> <br />Because of the major upheaval to our economy and the very significant harm to people who have saved money for much of their lives, I'm definitely againstthe national sales tax.	2005-10-09

A truly inspired, funny little novel from comedy great John Swartzwelder. <br /> <br />It involves the worst detective in the city (you'd have to be pretty desparate to hire him as you'd pass 3 other better detectives in the same building on the way to him) trying to solve a crime that will push his already limited talents to their limits.  His name: Frank Burly (well, not really, but that does describe him well), a perfect send-up of those tough, quick-witted detectives you find in other mysteries.   <br /> <br />Burly may be tough (well, pretty tough; he can take a beating, anyway) but he sure isn't quick-witted.  He wants to come up with the snappy one-liners but ends up just staring at the person at which he's trying to crack wise.  So when you have somebody like that trying to deal with something like time travel, you end up with very funny consequences. <br /> <br />Not only that but the book is simply packed, and I mean STUFFED, with hilarity on every page.  Swartzwelder is an endless fountain of comedy about everything imaginable. <br /> <br />Satirizing mystery, science-fiction and all of history, this book will have you laughing uproariously.	2005-10-09

When Newton published Principia, in 1686, not twenty men in Europe knew enough mathematics to understand it; yet by the middle of the eighteenth century ordinary people everywhere were eager to learn something about what was called the Newtonian philosophy. Men gave lectures on the subject and published books. Ordinary people talked about Newton for the same reason that in our time they talk about Darwin. The name Darwin stands for a new idea of the world and man's place in it. These ideas were opposed to the prevailing belief that men were naturally disposed to evil, so that, if allowed to think and act without restraint, they would follow evil courses and accept wrong ideas. According to Newtonian philosophy, it seemed as if God had said to humankind: \\"I have designed the world according to a rational plan; and I have given you a rational mind, capable of understanding that plan. That is all I can do, and you must make the best of it. By following reason and experience you may in time lean all about the universe and its laws and so in the end solve all your difficulties.\\" (Becker, Carl L. 1958 Modern History: The Rise of a Democratic, Scientific, and Industrialized Civilization page 186 Morristown NJ: Silver Burdett Co.).<br /><br />Now to the subject of concordances, they matter less than before due to the ability to download The Descent of Man from Project Gutenberg and search for a literal. Concordance has value in giving one a grasp on how many times a literal occurs and in what context. I still use the Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible, and I will keep A Concordance to Darwin's The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex right next to it.	2005-10-09

When I perused the text looking at issues and dipping here and there into the essays I did not notice any particular problems with the readings.  Looking very closely at them now, there appears a clear conservative slant.  My students have found finding these biases interesting at first, but the slanting soon became a point of annoyance for them.   <br /> <br />Her section on ethics and the law takes easy shots at lawyers for greed and deception, ignoring more relevant issues of privacy, or government and the individual.   <br /> <br />Her readings on religion and education dismiss opponents to religion in schools with ad hominem fallacies. <br /> <br />The ethics and the media readings overtly assert that the media is a liberal tool:  with the sneer that that accompanies the label \\"liberal\\" these days. <br /> <br />If you have an agenda in the classroom, a red state agenda, you might like this book very much.  The examples consistently mention Democratic party affliation and portray Democrats badly, while Republican bad examples either fail to mention party affliation, or are otherwise minimized in emphasis, length and number. <br />The reading selections commit any number of fallacies and employ frequent propaganda techniques: ad hominem,  ad populum,  transfer, name calling, etc. <br /> <br />I do not recommend this book for serious ethical study unless you wish to have before you a steady diet of slanted evidence with a clear political agenda, logical fallacies, and occasionally just plain poor writing.	2005-10-09

XSLT is one of those technologies that takes awhile to get the hang of.  Once you've learned the basics, you'll end up needing to refer back to reference material often.  One way to make that process a bit quicker would be to have a copy of Even Lenz's XSLT 1.0 Pocket Reference on hand...<br /><br />Contents:  Data Model; The XPath Language; How XSLT Works; Elements; Functions; Extending XSLT; XPath 1.0 Grammar; XSLT Pattern Grammar; Index<br /><br />Looking at the back cover, the impression is such that you could use this book to get \\"up to speed quickly\\" on XSLT.  Perhaps you could, but if this was your first and only exposure to XSLT and it works out that way, you're a far better IT professional than I am.  The information is concise and correct, to be sure.  But it's not going to walk you through the subject in a tutorial fashion.  Conversely, if you understand the basics and need a quick visual reference on how to use a feature, say like &lt;xsl:sort>, this book shines.  You don't have to wade through a dozen pages of conversation to find out the format and syntax.  Two pages total in this book, and you have all the details.  And that's what an O'Reilly's Pocket Reference title is for...<br /><br />If you're working with XSLT already and need that \\"cheat sheet\\" material, I'd recommend this book.

No matter how much Moira denied her feelings, no matter what she did to \\"get away,\\" Addis never abandoned her. BUT... he also never pushed her or forced her to sleep with him. I found myself wondering if they ever would! But the payoff is great and it makes you love Addis even more for being patient.  <br /> <br />I also enjoyed the fact that Addis and Moira had a background together that was explained through the course of the book. This helped give even more insight to their feelings towards each other.

I'm so glad that I found this book after having been to Egypt and Jordan/Petra because this book has given me insight into the original means of transportation within the Middle East.  Stephens' writing style is pure poetry and is a true joy to read.  The English language has evolved, but has not improved since his day.  To read this book is a true treat for the mind and adventurer. <br /> <br />After having had a private guided tour where we did not have to secure a boat that had been scuttled to save it from indentured service to the Pasha, and we did not have to obtain camels and goods as well as questionable guides that might slit our throats in the desert for our money, I could appreciate our accommodations much more.   <br /> <br />To have been an adventurer then was much more of a true adventure.  While I may have had a massage on the top deck of the cruise ship on the Nile at dusk, which made me feel like Cleopatra, I by no means was an adventurer of Stephens' stature and could appreciate the true effort it was to make the same trip 150+ years ago. <br /> <br />The Bedouins of today are not much different than the days of yore.  We did not have to sneak into Petra from over the mountains, but did sit down to coffee and tea provided by them. They still live in tents, but many are now driving top end Mercedes instead of camels.  :)   <br /> <br />After reading that he shot a pigeon at Denderah and shot out an eye of Hathor, I had to go back and look at my pictures to see if I could find that statue at the temple!   <br /> <br />If you go to Egypt or Petra, I recommend reading this book after the trip because it has much more meaning then.   <br /> <br />This book is a true treasure and I can see why a book written by a man who was born over 200 years ago is still in print!  I can only hope that it will stay in print for another 200 years so that \\"modern\\" people can appreciate the arduous travails of yore.	2005-10-09

If you have done your homework for a year, studied your math, and want to get better, this is an excellent text. It is very math heavy (but if you are not willing to wade through the details, you really should not be in sports gambling).<br /><br />If you read every gambling book that has been published, and are \\"in the know\\", you will see a recurring theme: the golden information rarely gets published. This book has the gold - including thorough analysis of NFL teasers, the value of NFL point buying, and solid money management advice (there are other topics as well, but these are most reconizable by intermediate sports bettors). Additionally, the handicapping analysis of turnovers (pp. 94-95) is worth the cost of the book alone, if you do your own handicapping.<br /><br />Although it is an exceptional text, it is not for beginners. If you are not mathematically inclined, or have not done number-crunching in the NFL for a year, you might be better off waiting on this book.	2005-10-09

Yes, the expected entries are here - a lengthy analysis of Wonder Woman, for example - but countless lesser-known heroines are enumerated and critiqued, from the sidekicks and helpmeets such as Supergirl and Batgirl to stand-alone adventuresses such as the Phantom Lady and Liberty Belle.  <br />However, the book is more than merely a dry recital of history. Robbin's energetic and vivacious style emphasises not just that these characters are remembered, but why they are special, as powerful role models for girls and women in a medium too often dominated by teenage hetboy fantasies. <br />Robbin's informed and enthusiastic text places each figure, from the 1940's to the present day, into a social context, while never losing sight of the sense-of-wonder appeal that is at the core of the comics medium. <br />Copious illustrations liven up the text, and if a dash of colour would have helped the monochrome pages - well, there's always the next edition!  <br />	2005-10-09

A spaghetti-like bunch of stories crisscrossing each other at 100 miles per hour over the legal speed limit going back and fourth, making you laugh regardless of the high lateral g-forces and clashing beautifully at the end in a Seinfeldllian way. Garnish it with a cover that reads Hammerhead Ranch Motel. <br /> <br />In Hammerhead you will follow Serge A. Storms, a serial killer psychopath and main character of the story, who is after a suitcase with five million dollars in it.  On the way you will cross characters like Lenny the pothead, City and Country the pretty girls soon to be potheads, The Diaz Boys, Edna Ploomfield, Johnny Vegas the virgin, The hurricane hunter crew, Boris the Hateful piece of $%^#, a dancing Chihuahua, Chester Porkchop Dole and many others.

As soon as he let it go, I took my turn.

It shows of his courage, his loyalty to his friends and his ability to learn and apply new knowledge quickly.   <br /> <br />Readers, especially those previously unfamiliar with Squanto's biography, will be shocked when Squanto finally is able to return to his family in America only to be kidnapped immediately by a slave trader and taken away to Spain to be sold.  <br /> <br />In the end, (you'll have to read it yourself to fill in the details!), it is easy to see why Squanto adopted the New World Pilgrims as friends.

Sardar is a deeply religious, indeed a passionate Muslim. He repeatedly excoriates secularism, of which he gives a highly subjective and partisan definition, and his account of its history (pp.249 to 251) is deeply flawed. He accepts the Qur'an as a revealed text (p.341), albeit one that has to be understood metaphorically rather than literally. He reveres Muhammad, and describes how emotionally shattered he was by Salman Rushdie's treatment of the Prophet in The Satanic Verses: \\"I felt that every word, every jibe, every obscenity [in it] was directed at me - personally\\" (p.281). Yet, as a liberal, he was equally horrified by the Ayatollah's fatwa calling for Rushdie's death.<br /><br />Our media do not often tell us that there are religious Muslims who also espouse modern knowledge, pluralism, and the principles of western democracies;  so it is good to see in the book of this prominent Muslim journalist that such Muslims do exist, and we need to hear a lot more from and about them than we do.  But it must be said that the picture which Sardar paints of most of the contemporary Muslim organizations, whether they are sects or the states he has visited, will provide ample evidence of how widespread is the rejection of modernity, pluralism and democracy in the Muslim world.  Sardar sees all these as a perversion of Islam, as cases of rigidity and of arrested development and as a betrayal of the spirit of its golden age under the early Abbasids (roughly from the 9th to the 12th century) and from which the West learnt so much.<br /><br />In the course of his Search for Paradise Sardar engaged with one Muslim sect after another and visited one Islamic country after another.  He paints a devastating picture of almost all of them.  Even modern Sufism, to which he felt most attracted, has strayed from its original nature and tends to go in for the unquestioning cult of the local Sufi sheikh. Here, as elsewhere, he found a disturbing authoritarianism at work.  Besides, he was troubled by the mystics' belief that a state of grace could be found only by withdrawing from the modern world, whereas for him the challenge was to bring a state of grace into the modern world.<br /><br />The Iranian Revolution obviously failed to provide the paradise Sardar was looking for; and the atmosphere in Ba'athist Iraq and Syria was equally oppressive, though in a different way.<br /><br />Sardar's devotion to Islam can be deduced from the fact that he had five times made the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca.  Each time he was more distressed at what was happening to Mecca:  sacred old buildings were being torn down to make way for six- or eight-lane roads and new concrete buildings, out of the construction of which the Bin Laden family made huge amounts of money.  These physical changes and the mass-tourism technology which was applied to these sacred areas, Sardar thought, increasingly destroyed the centuries-old rhythm of the hajj.  \\"The Saudis,\\" he writes, \\"approached technology as though it was theology. And in both, complexity and plurality was shunned\\", for of course the Wahhabi brand of Islam that dominates Saudi Arabia is as narrow, intolerant and antiquated as the fanatical brand of Shi'ism which dominated Iran.<br /><br />Disillusioned with all these experiences, Sardar was involved in setting up an institution and a journal devoted to working out an approach to a more liberal but still essentially Islamic approach to the intellectual disciplines of the modern world.  They could make no headway against \\"Islamization\\", the name given to the attempt to force these intellectual disciplines into an Islamic straitjacket, and which Sardar describes as \\"an uncontrollable forest fire that consumed everything in its path.\\" (p.213)<br /><br />What depresses Sardar is the realization that in so many parts of the world the rigidities and cruelties of the Sharia cannot be said to be imposed on the unwilling masses by the mullahs.  Even in countries like China, which do not have Islamic governments, it appears that the desire of most Muslims is to be governed by the Sharia:  they see it as defining their identities as Muslims.<br /><br />Only in post-Kemalist Turley and in Malaysia does Sardar find Islamic governments that accept pluralism, though he implies that in Malaysia it is under threat after its leading exponent, Anwar Ibrahim was forced out of office on trumped-up charges, imprisoned and tortured.<br /><br />Sardar is frequently depressed by the current state of the umma of which he cannot help but feel a member, and his book must be equally depressing for those readers who would like the efforts of the like of him to succeed.  His book unfortunately confirms the impression of today's Islam which is presented to us by the media and which many of us would so much like to dismiss as illegitimate stereotyping.  He presents himself and the little group of intellectuals around him as a gallant minority struggling against overwhelming odds (p.331) to shape a gentler, more tolerant, more pluralistic and above all a more intelligent Islam.  If he is right, the outlook for convivencia, for a peaceful coexistence between Islam and the West, is bleak indeed.  But perhaps he over-dramatizes:  perhaps there are millions of devout but tolerant Muslims like himself.  Perhaps especially in the West, many devout Muslims, just like devout Jews and devout Christians, have absorbed its respect for pluralism and a democratic society.  But they would need to speak out, to assert themselves vigorously and openly against those who preach narrowness and intolerance.  And if and when they do so, our media must report it, if only to give the lie to the vicious idea floated on p.311, that the West has a vested interest in demonizing Islam.al disciplines of the modern world.

The podcasting titles are starting to show up fast and furious.  I recently received a copy of O'Reilly's Podcasting Hacks - Tips & Tools for Blogging Out Loud by Jack D. Herrington.  It's a very good choice for both the rank novice as well as the person who wants to take their podcasting to the next level...<br /><br />Contents:  Tuning into Podcasts; Starting Out; Quality Sound; Formats; Interviewing; Blogging; Publicity; Basic Editing; Advanced Audio; On the Go; Videoblogging; Glossary; Index<br /><br />Some of the Hacks titles cover a wide range of tips and hints on a subject, and you end up picking and choosing what works for you.  There are a few that seem to go a step beyond and provide a pretty complete coverage of how to get started with something, as well as how to improve your skills if you've already started.  Podcasting Hacks seems to fall nicely into that second category.  There is some coverage on how to get going with listening to podcasts, like #8 - Listening to Podcasts on Your PDA and #9 - Podcatching with Your PlayStation Portable.  There's even a number of Perl hacks you can use to do some \\"roll your own\\" development.  But the book really shines when you get into the main areas of how to produce a podcast.  You'll learn how to pick the right microphone (#13) for your needs, how to set up a home studio (#61), and even how to produce your podcasts in surround sound (#16).  Add in a number of recommendations of hardware and software, and you've got a valuable guide to becoming the next voice to be heard...<br /><br />Unless you're already an Adam Curry in the podcasting world, this is a book worth reading.

This book is well written and describes the horrors that these children went through and into their adult lives.  The questions that were unanswered as children, the justice system, some answers, and the shock that another individual had to endure worse by the same hands of the perp.

I did search after search and read method after method for treating autism.  Nothing \\"felt\\" right.  The therapies based on behaviorism seemed to rob children of dignity.  Then I found the Option Institute website. <br /> <br />I read all they had published online and got the rest from the library system.  After reading their autism books, I felt I understood what I needed to do to help her.  I would have liked to go to their program, but there was no way I could leave her to attend. <br /> <br />I implemented my understanding of their program.  You know what?  Within two months she said, \\"I love you, Mommy.\\"  It was the first time in my parenting journey I had heard my child say that.  That was eight years ago.  I did the program alone for about six months.  She did great.  Now, she is not \\"cured.\\"  She is doing very well, though. <br /> <br />I was driven to look for the book again, as my four-year-old son was diagnosed with autism this week and I'm feeling that thing that parents feel when they get this news (again). <br /> <br />For those who say Son-Rise is about money, you can read this book at the library and get help.  How much does that cost?  You can pay the $10 or $15 for the book here on Amazon.  You are out $10 to $15.  If you read the book and want to go to the center; go for it.  The people I know who have done that feel the money was well spent. <br /> <br />For the reviewer who wants the name of a child who was cured, I'd give you mine, but it was not a complete cure.  I am going to go back and start a program again with her (what the heck, I'm going to do a program with my son, anyway).  When we started my self-designed program based on Son-Rise, my daughter made no eye contact, couldn't look in mirrors, had no communicative speech, and no normal response to stimuli.  We saw huge changes within the first week.  I still get emotional when I remember her telling me she loved me for the first time. <br /> <br />I thought I was providing a loving, nurturing environment for her before son-rise, but her remarkable progress with son-rise showed me she needed more.  It was amazing how, when she would bite her arms and I would bite mine in response, she would stop and look at me and be able to move on to something better. <br /> <br />This book, and others by Kaufman, taught me not to be afraid of autism.  The program advocated in this book allowed my daughter to keep her dignity and learn to join the mainstream.	2005-10-09

Her previous book The Camino had 36 pages (my number again) with the word love in it & on p.146 \\"yellow ... deals with personal power.\\" and on p.130 \\"Wisdom was represented by what we stood upon - our feet\\" and most animals are firmly grounded in unconditional love since they do have 4 feet and the snake is even more so by crawling with no feet. Being both of yellow skin and born under the snake sign, here is what I saw in:<br /><br />This present book at least has 4 pages where unconditional love is mentioned, p.182 \\"It will be difficult to live without Terry's constant reminders that I am capable of unconditional love\\" which is quite close to the last page 199[a step before 200 or t(w)o zero or to oneness nothingness.) Shirley is still in the receiving end of unconditional love. Unless Shirley BE-comes UNCONDITIONAL LOVE or the state of GRACE, I will say that Shirley will not reach stardom in this lifetime. Since Shirley is still seeking for outside for-give-ness (e.g. neutering Terry) instead of GrOwING WITHIN or BE-ing it. Please shift from RE-act-ing as in all movies and BE a real god as played in \\"All my Reviews\\" by facing each own and chosen 'Fall from Heaven Story' - FfHS.<br /><br />As far as i understand when each one of us is born, a physical star is also born in our universe. And both death are synchronous. This is one way to weave the relations between all entities and how the universe celebrates our passing through as in Osho's epitath. That's why there is the song \\"Wishing upon a star\\" because we all are. On p.167 (as seeks heaven) Terry, her dog states \\"Since my Mistress Mother is my child i hope i can teach her that growing up is essential to aging well. And the older she gets the further inside herself she should look. The more deeply she learns to love, the younger she'll be when she dies.\\"<br /><br />on p.166 (as seeks first perfect number & part of my number representation as Osiris) \\"Even now, while Terry is still in my life, I find myself WANTING to surround myself with animals ... I would be happy living with a menagerie... they point the way to a state of being we humans can only aspire to.\\" To aspire is to hope and not be present. As far as I know at least 6 millions or 0.1% of humans are in that state of being.<br /><br />on p.191 Terry states \\"The answers that MM seeks are hers to create.\\" To create rather than react (a play on word) is to be god. This book mentioned twice that god is dog backward.<br /><br />Dis-playing with my own example: I am creating situation where i am in synch with whatever the god in Neale Walsch's books (other books are in All my Reviews) & what Terry proclaimed here since 1996. The mundane was described in my letter to Jimmy Carter with my review of Prescription for Global Enlightenment. With that letter I realized that his Carter Center binds Jimmy in chains by being an institution, so will Shirley's animal menagerie.<br /><br />On p.178 Shirley is closer to being Unconditional Love when she questioned \\"Should I have adopted the children I wanted to when I was younger? Is that the impulse Terry is bringing out in me? Or is she bringing out a desire to adopt children now? ...No, I've earned this peace and quiet\\" Shirley with all her 70 years of experience still question her own intuition and defaulting to the Western mind's cop-out.<br /><br />She can break this impasse by choosing to adopt both animals and children. In my letter to Jimmy the statistics to my question \\"IS LOVE CONDITIONAL or UNCONDITIONAL?\\" is only valid in China. Among my 35 College Classmate in the US the ratio is far far lower. Only one, named very appropriately Violet, chose that Love IS Unconditional, although she can't do it either. The most common answer i get in US is that Unconditional Love can be for children.<br /><br />Naturally that declaration by itself is a lie, as though, one can separate love into all different kinds. A very simple example will show the different Western & Eastern mindset. In Asia most mothers choose to sleep with their children since birth, thus be one with the infant (or Terry.) Westerners choose to put their children in a cradle and even in a separate room as in Disney 'Lady and the Tramp', which my 3 year-old son Imagine is watching everyday for the past week with 'Sleeping Beauty'.<br /><br />Imagine is not happy when the masters put the puppy Lady out of the house in the beginning, and happy when Lady sneaks back in to the warmth of human bed. Initially when Kite found she was pregnant, I defer unconditionally to her choice. By the 3rd month she lost 20lb and then re-gained 30lb and we had inter_course until delivery day.<br /><br />If the choice was given to me, I would have chosen to abort because I thought I didn't need to go through being a father. I'm delighted Kite gave us the chance to experience what it's to love a child unconditionally.<br /><br />I have slapped Imagine on the hand or butt a few times before and always immediately apologized to him without excuses.<br /><br />3 real child-rearing unconditional love examples to free your self:<br />. Whenever Imagine cries, Happy, i and Kite never told him to stop. I sometimes even play along and ask him to cry louder. Naturally after checking he's not in physical pain or hungry.<br />. Whenever Imagine falls down I always come closer and notice if he got physical scratch, otherwise I simply tell him to get up by himself.<br />. When faced with what we normally term as dangerous, unlike the dead Bush by 2006/3/7 and other un-secure/winning mentality, i turn that into a shared learning experience in unconditional love as in my review of \\"Lifelong Happiness.\\"<br /><br />One important thing I can find out with Imagine is to confirm that i can choose to be as young as i choose to be. This is in synch with how Kite sees me as neither male nor female, and my chosen epitath of 'a good person is not really that good and a bad person is not really that bad', since it's all a matter of enlarging perspective and be one with it all.<br /><br />Whenever i declare my love to Kite and Happy or talk about Imagine, I always say that i also love every one else. Because we are all truly equal, as god in disguise, and we can learn a lot from our best teachers, the children, before their own 'Fall from Heaven Story' - FfHS. To die with children around is bliss, this is one reality check for Terry's statement of \\"The more deeply (Shirley) learns to love, the younger she'll be when she dies.\\"<br /><br />My own litmus test is to ask \\"what do you choose to do, if you knew you are going to be dead tomorrow\\". If you don't want to face the question, let me rephrase it without the 'if' which is in the past:<br /><br />\\"Do you know you are not going to die tomorrow?\\" Which is from the present.<br /><br />For people living for the future i'll rephrase the question as \\"Ever since human have been born into this world, there is one thing, and only one thing, coming from the future right into our face\\"<br /><br />That's really the only leash we're all in, as equal as, in our own choice of 'Fall from Heaven Story' - FfHS - too and choice of birth and death and everything in between.

These aren't hangers-on who are looking to find a man to fund their shopping and lunching habits.  Lipstick Jungle is the story of three major power NY players, all attractive and abitious women, working on furthering their careers even more.  We have Wendy, a movie producer angling to earn a few Oscars for her films and pull a big budget film out of the doldrums.  There's Victory, a fashion designer whose done well the past few years, but wants to become a major player and make her business more secure.  And there's Nico, a trendy magazine executive who is angling to put her boss out of a job and move up even further in the world.<br /><br />The male-female relationship dynamic is flipped upside down in this book.  Two of these women have husbands who earn far less than they do (and Wendy's husband Shane is a slacker who spends her money on clothes and personal care and failed business ventures).  Wendy enjoys her movie location shoots as an escape from a trying home life with three children.  Nico, the executive, finds satisfaction in an affair with a boy-toy who could be compared to Janey from Trading Up with his vacant lifestyle and ladder climbing attempts.  The one single character, Victory, struggles with dating a billionaire, because she's accustomed to her millionaire lifestyle and doesn't want to become dependent on a man and his money.<br /><br />Bushnell's fans will find some familiar characters in this book, namely Seldon Rose from Trading Up, who becomes a player in Wendy's professional and personal life.  Comstock Dibble and his fizzled out career are also mentioned in passing.  However, this book is different enough from her previous works that I think Bushnell might pick up some new fans, women who don't know every shoe and handbag manufacturer of the moment, but who would like to read an exciting and dynamic book about women trying to balance their quest for power with their personal and family lives.ng and dynamic book about women trying to balance their quest for power with their personal and family lives.	2005-10-09

I tried to like this novel because as one who believes in predestination, I thought it would show some of the opposing arguments in fictional form; it failed to do this.  James Hogg merely shows us a deranged human being (nothing new there!) who murders because he feels that he is 'destined for heaven' no matter what he does. Yes, he might have been saved from the fires of hell, but it would have been by God's grace, not by his own good or evil works. Isn't this what the New Testament is all about-grace in spite of man's evil doing? Whether one is predestined or 'chooses good or evil' makes no difference in the end-what matters is who saves you from your own mortal destiny which is death. This story fails to show any unique theological and/or psychological perspective. I was dissatisfied with the author's far-fetched and anti-logical presentation of a doctrine he clearly did not understand.	2005-10-09

Aurelius Augustinus 354-430 AD.<br />He was born in Thagesta in Numidia (North-Africa).The Confessions' has two parts. The first part is a kind of autobiography and the second part is a commentary to the first chapters of Genesis.<br />He taught rhetorics first in Carthago in Africa, later in Milan in Italy. But after a while he developed an aversion not only for rhetorics ( he began to consider it as useless and conceited and as a pool of sins ) but also for his fellow-man.<br />He began to show neurotic behaviour like having a fainting fit without apparent cause. It's for those reasons that psychologists like to study Augustine's Confessions.<br />As a result of his problems, Augustine became a Christian and he was one of the first to found a monastery. Later on he became bishop of Hippo in North-Africa.<br /><br />In the second part of 'The confessions', he tries to explain the first chapters of Genesis. ( This second part is very impressive and is the cause that \\"The Confessions\\" is in my personal top five of the best books I read during the last 30 years.)<br /><br />His plan was to comment on the whole Bible but he soon understood that this was an impossible task for one man.<br />Nevertheless he's is considered as the Father of modern Theology because of his comments.<br />To give two examples: When the Bible says that God created man to His image, Augustine explains that it means that man knows the difference between good and evil just like God does, it doesn't mean a physical resemblance.<br />Another interesting thought is about Creation. Creation is not limited in space and time: since God is everywhere, Creation is also everywhere and goes on till eternity.<br /><br />As conclusion I should mention that 'The Confessions'is also important because it is the first publication in Antiquity in which an author reveals his most inner feelings.	2005-10-09

Its maimed and hardened protagonist, Detective Pete Caudill, discovers in Detroit, in the days immediately preceding the riots of 1943, a realm of lies and half-truths, corruption and conspiracy, that bleakly echoes the carnage and horror of the larger world in the midst of World War II.  It is with the one-eyed Pete, initially the classic second element of a good cop/bad cop team, that we journey from damnation to redemption.   <br /> <br />The professional reviewers cited here seem, in many ways, to have missed the point.  This book moves far beyond your average police procedural.  This is a novel about evil, about blasted souls in a blasted universe, and about the journey of one man through darkness into tremulous light. <br /> <br />If the rhetoric of the paragraph preceding seems more suited to Milton than Chandler, this is intentional. What sets Bartoy apart from most writers in this genre is his willingness to grapple seriously and effectively with issues of profound moral resonance.  Racism, corruption, sex, love, family, murder, incest: these may seem, on the one hand, what we would anticipate in the noir, but we should remember that the reason for the noir's endurance is precisely its confrontation with these elements that are the engines as well of Biblical narrative and Greek tragedy.   <br /> <br />And they are all here, in this book, in the midst of a gripping mystery that vividly and accurately evokes a cultural and urban landscape vastly different from the one that exists today.  As we follow our flawed, literally half-blind hero through a society of both glittering prosperity and bleakest poverty, we experience a growing dread that only catastrophe can lead to some sort of even tentative salvation.  <br /> <br />PUBLISHERS' WEEKLY's reviewer, in particular, seems at sea when trying to deal with the book's conclusion.  A spectacular collision, a race riot, beatings and blood--it is hard to see how this can be \\"maudlin.\\"  But perhaps the commentator merely has his Marys confused. <br /> <br />Buy it.  Read it.  It's a kick in the gut. <br />	2005-10-09

I found this book to be not quite as bad as some reviewers have, but not quite as good as it promised. It was definitely readable, and intriguing. There was a clever dual story which unfolded concerning the royal confectioner, Miss Cornwallis, who crafted 'subtleties' for the royal court and of course, Anne Boleyn. The parallel story of the confectioner was actually more interesting to me than the Anne Boleyn story. The author does a good job of making  characters such as musician Mark Smeaton 'real' and not not footnotes of history. Her treatment of Queen Anne, to which most reviewers seem to object, is not overly sympathetic--neither is is particularly crass. The author explains in the endnotes the use of names such as Tom and Tommy, for Cromwell and Cranmer, as a way to help distinguish their personalities. This is presuming that Anne would not have referred to either of them in her diary notes by their surnames.  The storyline is uneven...I was never 100 percent sure if the two tales were entirely parallel..but it does provide an interesting perspective as to the roles of the Queen and the commoner/confectioner.  If you're looking for a book highly sympathic to Anne Boleyn, this isn't it. Neither is it anti-Anne. Suzannah Dunn has done an interesting job of trying to make Anne contemporary in thought and in feel.  Perhaps that is the problem. Her times--the roles of women, the 'chivalry and romance' of her time, do not translate to the current day. Worth a read? Yes, I think so. The author is definitely a talented storyteller. As I can attest, you can't tell anyone what to write--had she done a novel strictly about the confectioner, and tied that in to her times and the Court of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, it might have been received better. Still, definitely a good read, for a novelization about Anne's 'diary' and memories. Keep in mind that excellent novels, such as The Lady in the Tower, are already out there. If you're like me, and always looking for something 'new' to read about Anne of the Thousand Days, you will probably find this book of interest. Could it have been better? With 20/10 hindsight, yes, of course. Still, it's a well researched, nicely written novel.ng 'new' to read about Anne of the Thousand Days, you will probably find this book of interest.

While I'm not sure the stories gel as a whole (in fact, the attempts to link them sometimes distracts from the effectiveness of each), each part of this triptych is an absorbing page-turner that is more accessible (without being \\"down-market\\") than is any of his previous novels. Throughout, and to showy effect, Walt Whitman's America and Cunningham's New York provide the common thematic background for the entire book.<br /><br />The first of the three stories is, I think, the most memorable and certainly the eeriest. James's \\"Turn of the Screw\\" comes to mind repeatedly, although Cunningham's tale is set in the crowded streets of late-nineteenth-century Manhattan instead of the claustrophobic English countryside. Seen through the eyes of a young boy whose older brother has just died, a victim of a ghastly accident in one of America's new sweatshops, \\"In the Machine\\" recalls the terrors, real and imagined, of the Industrial Revolution. Walt Whitman makes his only bodily appearance in the book, but there's a bit of dissonance when one of the pivotal moments recalls a famous event from 1911--nineteen years after Whitman's death. At first I thought that this was one of the story's Shyamalan-inspired moments (perhaps Whitman was another one of the story's ghosts!), but Cunningham in his preface acknowledges that events \\"may have been separated by twenty years or more.\\" So, I gather, he intentionally sacrifices historical precision for a good story, but I'm not convinced the diversion was necessary.<br /><br />Nevertheless, what makes each of these three tales fascinating is Cunningham's adventurousness and his willingness to experiment with new genres and the form of the novel itself. In the second story, \\"The Children's Crusade,\\" he shows that he can blend the horror of September 11, a detective story about pre-adolescent suicide bombers, and a knockout finale without losing sight of his intentions. The third parable, however, about an extraterrestrial nanny and a humanoid who escape New York, occasionally strikes a false note. At its best, \\"\\"Like Beauty\\" might remind readers of the better stories of Ray Bradbury (albeit, with far more lyrical writing), but at times Cunningham seems a stranger to the genre (or, perhaps, I simply read so much sci-fi that I'm more sensitive to the misfires). Still, it's got a wallop of a chase scene and two memorably humane portraits of its nonhuman protagonists.<br /><br />Finally, the linkages among the three novellas range from inorganic surface connections (i.e., the character's names in each section, the reappearance of a small white bowl) to the book's underlying themes (its homage to New York City and, of course, the influence of the Walt Whitman). But even the poetry references don't always work; in the ghost story, the young narrator blurts out seemingly random, often appropriate, sometimes obscure lines from \\"Leaves of Grass,\\" which at times nearly reduces free verse to a mutation of Tourette's syndrome.<br /><br />Still, it's been two months since I finished \\"Specimen Days,\\" and I can't get large chunks of it out of my mind. Overall, I'm beginning to realize, the manifest flaws that result from Cunningham's eagerness to take brave risks don't overpower the strength of his portraits and the thrill of his plots.cent suicide bombers, and a knockout finale without losing sight of his intentions.

My objective in going to the exam was to learn the basics of database and passing the exam was secondary ( i have a fairly well settled job where certification does not matter much).Anyway, No review on certification books is complete without giving a background of your experiences on the subject : <br /> <br />MY DBA EXPERIENCE : <br />My experiences on  Oracle DBA fundamentals is practically and theoretically zero. I have already passed the Introduction to Oracle9i SQL exam which is a pre-requisite to get certified. You can be a master in SQL skills and still be a novice in DBA Fundamentals. Frankly I DID NOT  know the following : <br /> <br /> 1. Physical structure of database is composed of controlfiles, datafiles and log files <br /> 2. Never knew that most developers and DBA's spend the time on logical structures which are    tables, tablespace etc and do not physically exist in the database <br /> 3. Had never heard of V$views <br /> 4. I was aware of tables, tablespaces ,DDL commands etc <br /> 5. I am an application developer and bulk of my interaction with oracle was select     statements,update statements etc <br />6. Was aware of different types of indexes and that is an important topic in both SQL     fundamentals exam and DBA fundamentals exam <br />  <br />If you can answer to all of the above criteria's with a confident 'yes', you are most likely a DBA already and just want to get urself a pay raise by getting certified..Yes, this book will help to breeze thro ( i read about someone who got the exam passed by studying the book for 40 hours).For newbies like me, it is not that easy..in fact it is doubly difficult over intro to sql exams because, i lacked the practical experience ( try inactivaing a tablespace from your company database).  <br /> <br />STUDY EFFORT : This book goes through every topic in detail,but sorely misses the visual explanation that would have made some topics easy ( example ...shutting down an instance and startup). This is thereason why i am not giving 5 stars to the book. Neverthless every topic was well described. some of the topics are little elaborate eating into our valuable study time. I studied the book totally 4 times , since after every reading ,tried doing the question paper and slowly removed the errors in understanding.It took a whopping 6 months for me ( and my friend) to learn as you earn.With little more effort, probably i could have got certified in 4 months <br /> <br />I used the book tests and Best of all, my friend who also passed the exams sent me a question paper ( that be purchased in ebay) based on Jason Couchman's book  Took that exam( about 150 questions)..and everytime went back to the book reading the chapters and sections where i got it wrong . As a matter of fact, the question paper from jason was very very closely aligned with the questions i got in the exam. <br /> <br />EXAM : Passed the exam .scored 49 correct ( required 44). there was not one question on syntaxes . i assume the oracle examiners have decided it is too easy to find syntaxes on the internet and were focusing on understanding of the subject ( ex : steps taken to multiplex a control file) <br />If passing the exam is primary for u..don't miss the simulation exams of Jason Couchman ( of course u need to study )..but if u want to learn every aspect of  DBA Fundamentals, use this book. On the job, this book is a great resource ( according to a junior DBA in our team). Well written book! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

So I voted Republican, but was too busy working to really ever practice any Republican principles to obtain my goals.

It's supposedly coming out in paperback and the old Swiftboat Anti-Kerry ads are rumored to be airing on retro tv. This hardback will soon become a collectors item.    And regarding that 8mm camera and typewritter, it wasn't issued, it was Kerry's own personal equipment which he brought from home. That has been documented as well. So the five star reviewer is right and the 1 star reviewer is wrong again..as usual. Oh and Kerry waited 35 years to use it? You have to be the biggest moron of all the Pro Kerry Morons (the 2 or 3 who are left). He ran for president one time 35 years after his supposed \\"heroism\\" and he planned this out in advance, over 35 years ago. That is why he waited 35 years to use this \\"exploitation of alleged heroism\\" in his one and only run for president. However, Kerry also used this vietnam hero hype in his run for other political positions as well.       And as far as Christmas in Cambodia and speaking to Pres. Nixon in December 1968 (Johnson was the president in '68), it's in Unfit For Command and documented by the Boston Globe in an interview they did with Kerry back in 1979. It in fact this 1 star reviewer had actually even browsed this book, he would know that. Obviously, this 1 star reviewer never browsed let alone read Unfit For Command. But why be surprised at this 1 star reviewers blatant disregard for truth? Like Kerry he thinks he can lie and get away with it.    It's certain that Kerry won't run for anything ever again (except maybe dog catcher)his credibility has been destroyed and he was beated decisively in 2004. Plus he has been acting like a beaten loser ever since. 1 star reviewer, I know, don't confuse this 1 star reviewer with the truth huh? But at least we got this sometimes 5 star reviewer who is really a 1 star reviewer to admit that he continually reposts, in his own words: \\"As I said before.\\" didn't he say that he only posted one time? And once again we proved to this fool that he just doesn't know what the heck he is talking about. But why be surprised, he supports Kerry! And since he likes to use the word \\"wedgie\\" so often, I guess we all know what his favorite pastime is don't we Peter H???    Best advice I can give to this nitwit, is to go to the bookstore, read the book and then come back and try to create an articulate argument. But if you are honest and intelligent, you will find out what we all found out. You will also find out the truth about where Kerry really was on Christmas Eve '68 and the truth about that heavy 8mm camera and typewritter with carbon paper no doubt that he lugged around.     KERRY IS GUILTY AS CHARGED.    CASE CLOSED    HE HAS YET TO REFUTE ANY OF THIS!    CASE CLOSED!    HE HAS YET TO SUE THE SWIFTBOAT VETS!    CASE CLOSED.    Okay amigo?

Judy Sheehan has a distinct style that makes the dialogue and even the narration read like real life, which, in turn, makes the characters come to life even more fully. Because this is very much a character-driven novel, you are pulled into Jane's struggles and deluged with her life as if you were living it. Sheehan captures the daily life of a single woman living in New York perfectly and more wonderfully describes the adoption process. Personally, I never knew that much about adoption, but after reading this book, I feel as if I was introduced to another world, and coming away from that, I now have a newfound respect for anyone who chooses to adopt.

He draws from almost thirty years of experience to tell the reader the best way to raise livestock, maintain pasture and cultivated land, dig a pond, fell trees, and well, you get the idea. It makes me want to put into  practice what I read as soon as possible. I look at the land in a whole different way thanks to this book. For those of you into the Bible, this book offers great instructions on being a steward of the land. If you take care of your trees and animals, they'll take care of you.    This book does leave me with a lot of questions, which is good and frustrating at the same time. Since Gene Logsdon grew up on a farm and has spent all his life writing for farmers, he might take for granted the knowledge he has that some of us new to agriculture might not. I still don't know what a combine is, or what a manure spreader looks like, or what keeps the layers warm in the henhouse over the winter. Logsdon mentions in the chapter about forestry that illustrations would best explain the safety precautions that he details with words. That makes me think that maybe there are no illustrations in the book because of restrictions set by the printer or editor.     I would also like to know what assets to look for when buying a farm, or how to go about buying one in the first place. Logsdon also lets on little about what his wife contributes to their 32-acre homestead. He refers to his work only in the first person singular, though obviously it takes at least two people to do the work.    In the end, though, these frustrations just make me want to read more books on the subject, which will make me a better-informed person for when it comes time to start a farm. I do think, though, that one should first take advantage of the apprenticeships that a lot of cottage farmers in Virginia and Maryland offer, if practical knowledge is lacking. It's hard to imagine putting into practice on a farm what we read from books without first getting a feel for it somewhere else.    Despite my frustrations and suggestions, this is definately a book to buy and not check out from the library if you plan on farming at all. It can serve as a valuable source of reference throughout the year.	2005-10-09

Adored it.  At that point, I had read several places that Ishiguro's masterpiece was The Unconsoled.<br /><br />Well, it's certainly different from his other works.  500 pages of a surrealist dream sequence in which things make sense only to the narrator.  People he doesn't know at first become people he's had relationships with for years.  The plot is almost insignificant, for, like a long and complicated dream, it weaves back and forth so you don't really ever know what's happening.  I suppose if you view this as a written description of a dream, it's very effective.  I found it incredibly frustrating, and in the end, it left me cold.<br /><br />It's quite Kafka-esque, though, so if you like that, you'll probably like this.  Me, not such a big fan, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised this didn't do it for me.<br /><br />I'm giving it two stars because even though I didn't care for it, it really is quite well-written.  And frustrating or not, there's something to be said for that.	2005-10-09

This book destroys the myth that illegal drugs have some magical power to transform a user into a drug crazed addict almost at once. Certainly there are people who are more likely to become addicted to various substances, whether it is alcohol, marijuana, heroin or even gambling. But for the great majority of people it is clear that limited recreational use is possible. Given this, the war on drugs is an absurdity. And one that is costing more in money and human suffering than can be imagined.   <br />    Saying Yes is the best book on drugs use and the drug wars since Mike Gray's (1998) Drug Crazy.	2005-10-09

It is the most original contribution of Sri Aurobindo to the modern knowledge systems. To the reader of this work, Indra is no longer a mere mythological deity, but the master of his own 'indriyas', senses,  with whose active help, it would be easy to win new frontiers of awareness. Varuna is not simply the lord of the sea but the highest psychological state of oceanic vastness, light and purity into which we all must aspire to surge forth. By this simple exercise of replacing the connotations, one turns with profit the Vedic text of great antiquity into an excellenct self-management treatise. The Veda is no more prisoned in rituals and conventions but becomes a handbook of self-culture.<br /><br />As a result, thematic unity between the Veda and the Upanishads has been restored. By addressing the most primordial  existential issues besetting human life, the Veda is a univesal testament, and Sri Aurobindo has delivered it from the confines of a particular religion.	2005-10-09

It is meticulously researched, with a stunning degree of detail and comprehensiveness for events that took place 600 years ago.

The art of making good rather than poor Decisions is the single main difference between a top organisation and a weak one; or a top manager and a poor one - yet business literature really has few excellent books that focus on how to ensure high quality decisions are consistently made in an organisation. Instead the typical management bookshelf may be populated with the Jack Welch type volumes where charisma and gut instinct are turned into heroic virtues.<br /><br />Well, in an age where Gladwell's Blink is a best seller and the incredible capacity of humans to make quick judgments is being celebrated, lets not forget that gut instinct can lead to terrible mistakes also. In an organisation these can be devastating.<br /><br />Both Yates and writers such as Scott Plous (author of the wonderful Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making) point out a raft of human errors where our gut can lead us into terrible choices.<br /><br />J Frank Yates has worked and consulted at high levels in the USA, Beijing, Netherlands and Japan, and from his experience he has broken down decision-making into a hierarchy of 10 quite sensible questions that act as a checklist for managers. The list begins with the simple fundamental: Why are we deciding anything at all? and then asks: Who, or what, will make this decision - and how will they approach this task.<br /><br />The volume then drills into the various skills required to consider the options, trade-offs, and possibilities that might arise from a decision: those \\"unforseen consequences\\" that seem all too often to surprise decision makers.<br /><br />Yates peppers the book with good actual case histories (both good and bad outcomes are portrayed) and takes the time to consider how a better decision-making culture can be created in organisations.<br /><br />I don't agree with all of Yates findings and recommendations - but that may be a product of my more emotive personality traits (Yates strikes me as an absolutely rational type) but this volume has proved extremely useful in providing a foundation in \\"decision thinking\\" relevant to my work in research where a key challenge is to bump research findings into the court of organisational decision-making.

I mainly used the sleep method, which included not letting the baby sleep more than 4 hours, feeding as soon as I woke her and then keeping them awake for at least 20-30 minutes after feeding.   <br />I was very flexible with this method to fit my needs and my baby's needs.  I think the most important aspect to the method is not letting the baby fall asleep while feeding.  For some reason, that makes the biggest difference in letting them sleep through the night.   <br />As for the other suggestions in the book, i.e. letting the baby cry it out. etc., I took it with a grain of salt.  I don't think you should let a baby cry it out if she's under 3 months.  In fact, I suggest using \\"The Happiest Baby on the Block\\" book in conjunction with this book.

The basic premise behind Mine Yoshizaki's SGT FROG manga is this: froglike alien Sgt. Keroro and his extraterrestrial compatriots, in a failed attempt to conquer Pokopen (the Earth), find themselves stranded in the company of two Pokopenian siblings, Fuyuki and Natsumi Hinata, and their friends and family. Hilarity ensues. There you go. That's the series - beyond that there is no real coherent plot. But that's not particularly important, because the fact is a complex storyline isn't required for madcap comedy of this order. <br /> <br />The best comparison you can draw to Sgt. Frog is probably to Pinky & the Brain: overloaded with pop culture (Japanese anyway) allusions and socio-political send-ups, our protagonist conjures up preposterous scheme after preposterous scheme, to no avail. Another easy comparison would be with Invader Zim. The biggest difference between Sgt. Frog and these others, however, is the ensemble size: while P&B revolved around the clashing personalities of the title characters, and Invader Zim a team of four or so, Sgt. Frog is propelled by a stable cast of about a dozen unique, distinctly off-the-wall personalities.  <br /> <br />There's Natsumi Hinata, for instance, the Pokopenian teen whose authoritative hot-headedness remains the biggest obstacle on the path to invasion - apart from Sgt. Keroro himself, equal parts inept interstellar conqueror and freeloading plastic Gundam model fanatic. Then there's Natsumi's younger brother Fuyuki, a quiet, introverted kid with a keen interest in the occultm or Momoka Nishizawa, the insecure heiress to a worldwide fortune with a keen interest in Fuyuki. Not to mention Private Tamama, one of the Sgt.'s fellow-invaders, whose adorable exterior belies a violent split personality; the ditzy Lady Angol Moa, sent to Earth by her father the universal Lord of Terror to destroy it, but diverted by Keroro's misadventures; and many more. <br /> <br />The various plots, goofy and overblown as they are, make full use of the characters' interpersonal chemistry. For instance: when the School Sports Festival rolls around, athletic Natsumi petitions mom Aki to join her in the child-parent activities. But Aki is unable to attend due to her demanding career as a manga editor, which causes her to be gone most of the time anyway. Natsumi is forlorn by yet another absence, and while Keroro schemes to stand in for Mom Hinata in an attempt to put Natsumi in his debt, Corporal Giroro, whose hard-boiled shell hides a monstrous affection for the girl, has other plans. Meanwhile, Fuyuki suffers from a lack of self-confidence living in his sister's athletic shadow, and wealthy Momoka's attempts to aid his cause at the Festival, like having her bodyguards tranquilize the other racers, are sweet but probably misguided. That's just a sampling, from one of the tamer chapters at that - the insanity quotient is generally far more in excess. <br /> <br />Many of the installments have sensitive undercurrents: unrequited love, the clash between friendship and duty, jealousy, emotional insecurity, family dynamics, and so on. But there's something of overanalyzing in that evaluation, because any pyschological underpinnings involved are offset by copious coatings of over-the-top illustration, harebrained scenarios, laugh-out-loud hilarious gags, and unforgettably zany characters. Be forewarned: in spite of Keroro and Company's admitted adorability it's not for kiddies - there's enough sexual suggestion here to border on ecchi at times. But it's all in fun, and if you have a well developed sense of the absurd, as I like to put it, Sgt. Frog is as good n' silly as it gets.	2005-10-09

By further studying these snapshots, we can peform some anthropoligical cultural study, according the author. Plausible.  The rest of the book, however, doesn't directly address his premise, but provides a \\"layman's\\" account of what Internet search means, and how it has evolved.  It discusses the history of \\"search companies\\" from the first main company Altavista to Google. Much of the book is certainly focused on talking about the company whose motto is \\"Dont be evil!\\" (google), though at appropriate contexts, the author provides interesting snippets of how other companies dealt with similar issues, or when their paths crossed. It does make for an interesting reading.  A slightly romanticized version of Google's initial days, and its IPO is also presented by the author.   <br /> <br />Each chapter is neatly organized and presents additional insights into the growth of Google and the underlying stories within the \\"search\\" community.  The chapter, \\"the pefect search\\" is perhaps the best written chapter in the book and presents some interesting questions that could very well set the agenda/checkpoints for years to come in this field. The discussion on the Patriot Act and its relevance in the context of search makes for some dry reading, though it does raise some pertinent and important issues. <br /> <br />The rather superficial technical discussion, when it does exist,  makes it is clear that the author is targeting people without much technical background but enough technical curiousity  (and maybe he wants to cash in the hype Google seems to create every other day!) Regardless, the book is well-paced and the use of a simple narrative style makes it read like a novel (and thats a good thing). A must read.	2005-10-09

Michael Connelly's \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is the author's first foray into the legal thriller genre.  He has already proven himself a master of the police procedural with his marvelous Harry Bosch series. This novel introduces California criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller, a man with two ex-wives and an eight-year-old daughter named Hayley.  Mickey is known as a sleazy lawyer who lives on the edge, barely managing to make ends meet by defending drug dealers, junkies, and an occasional accused murderer.<br /><br />To Mickey, \\"the law was not about truth.  It was about negotiation, amelioration, manipulation.\\"  It is a good day for Mickey when he gets a guilty client off on a technicality.  He enjoys punching holes in the prosecution's cases and the cops and district attorneys hate his guts.  Mickey's most deep-seated fear is one that he inherited from his father, who was a prominent lawyer for almost thirty years--the fear of failing to protect an innocent client from being sent to prison.<br /><br />Haller, who does much of his work out of his Lincoln Town Car, is now busier than ever.  He has a new client named Louis Roulet, who was arrested for aggravated assault and attempted rape, and the suspect's family is filthy rich.  When Roulet asks Haller to represent him, the lawyer immediately sees dollar signs dancing before his eyes.  This might be the big score, or as Mickey likes to say, \\"the gift that keeps on giving,\\" with legal fees that could climb well into the six figures.  Little does Mickey know that by taking this case, he will be jeopardizing his career as well as his life. The unexpected fallout will change the way that Mickey views himself and the law forever.<br /><br />Connelly does a masterful job of setting up an intricate narrative that features believable characters, crisp dialogue, and compelling courtroom scenes.  \\"The Lincoln Lawyer\\" is funny, brash, cynical, suspenseful, and at times, shocking.  I have some reservations about the plot, which has gaping holes that are never filled.  However, this is a book with bite.

Unfortunately his overly positive approach does not present an accurate view of the field. Telepathy, clairvoyance, precognition, psychokinesis; to hear Rhine's account you'd think these were all proven. If a tested phenomenon has been reported positively twice, Rhine considers it verified, no matter how many negative studies have been done, no matter allegations of experimental weakness, data manipulation and subject and experimenter fraud.<br /><br />Not one of the phenomena Rhine discusses can be routinely verified under adequately controlled conditions to this day.

It's Lawford's account of his life as a Kennedy, Lawford and an addict. The fly leaf sets up the story with the following: What happens when you are born with the American dream fulfilled? I was given wealth, power, and fame when I drew my first breath. Now what?  <br /> <br />The first half of the book \\"packs so much material on his family that a Kennedy-parasite biographer could find a career's worth of stories,\\" writes Janet Maslin of NY Times. Then half way through we descend into the bleak world of addiction. I'm fortunate that drugs, alcohol, and addiction have not played a meaningful role in my life, but I had a few friends who became addicted 20 years ago and I spent years trying to help them before giving up. I lost both of them. As a result, the book had an unbelievable impact on me. I worked my way through the first half slowly -- it was hard to move through it very quickly. <br /> <br />The second half is a story of renewal, as he writes: \\"For those of you who bought this book for stories about my descent into darkness, the Rat Pack, and the Kennedys - you can stop reading now. For the rest, I'm here to tell you the most interesting part of my story is not what happened in the dark alley but what has happened in the sunlit room.\\" Slowly - Lawford starts to make progress. As the period of time that he's sober and clean lengthens, he starts to address his issues, and some of his real demons. He is incredibly honest, extremely insightful, and admirable in how he takes responsibility for his actions.  <br /> <br />This book is a journey, and what a journey it is and as Lawford says has to be read from beginning to end. There's no index...which I thought was brilliant. Five Stars *****	2005-10-09

There are few contemporary novels I have read in the mystery, thriller, or espionage genre' that explode right from the onset and keep you racing thru the pages the way Peter Thomas novel The Den Of The Assassin does.  Now make no mistake, this is not simply a story of terrorists and violence, but an extremely clever and creative thriller that uses extensive current data (non-fiction based information)to weave an exhilarating story filled with great layers of depth and character developement. <br /> <br />There are three significant strenghts to Thomas' novel: 1) The story and multiple-layered plot lines are credible, strong, and unexpected. The story simply takes hold of you.  2) The character development and the characters' movements juxtaposed with the strong story line enhance the various positions the author clearly brings out.  In particular, I truly enjoyed the character of Tyler Boxter, Julia Mercardo, Judge Pitt, Dan Genovese, and of course, \\"The Father\\" - Stockow. 3)Thomas' writing style was easy and fluid.  In covering areas of complexity such a international finance and geopolitics in such detail I expected I would need to concentrate on the story a bit more; however, the author's writing style allowed me to keep turning the pages. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an outstanding book on par with the best of the best in the area of international espionage.  I look forward to Peter Thomas' next novel with great fanfare!	2005-10-09

A Widow's Walk explained what it was like for those who suffered more personal losses... the losses of husbands, fathers, sons, brothers, and entire battalions of firemen.

I was not at all impressed with Frey's writing style or his muitilation of grammar and punctuation.  It was repetitive, self absorbing and predictable. I do not think he is a literary genius.  I had no idea this was one of \\"Oprah's Must Reads\\" until I got up to the counter to pay for it and noticed the sticker on the front cover.  Seeing that alone almost made me put it back.  I was so bored with the relentless \\"cravings\\" and desires to destroy himself. Addiction is a choice and the reason people choose not to quit is because it's hard, it's VERY hard to break an addiction.  However it's still a personal choice.  This book made Best Seller because so many people believe in the psycho babble crap that's out there today; thanks to the \\"Dr. Phil's, Oprah's and Network News\\". It's always everyone else's fault; or George Bush's fault and not their own.  The severe lack of personal accountability in this country and all the people who buy into it is what's destoying this country.  The, \\"It's all about ME attitude\\" is the worst addiction we face today.  If you're interested in reading an exceptionally well written, honest, heart felt substance abuse book, I highly recommend, \\"Dry\\" by Augusten Burroughs.  Now there's a writer.	2005-10-09

Scott Peck's message that \\"life is difficult\\" reached people who were ready to face the truth and tackle life head on.  Through many interactions with patients, he shows us that we can overcome our past failures and limiting perceptions, to increase our self esteem and the quality of our lives.  I recommend this classic book together with another superb book, Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self.  Optimal Thinking is the road along which we all make the most of the everpresent moment, any situation, business and life.  Read both books!	2005-10-09

The facts of her life are adhered to: her growing literary success; her difficult and cold upper class parents; the death from a sudden onset leukemia of her fiance and editor; her purchase of a small farm in the English Lake Country.  But, the events surrounding the \\"mystery\\" are Susan Wittig Albert's contribution - the excellent description of the countryside and  the times (later 1800's), the people, the speech patterns,etc. are done \\"in the manner of\\" Beatrix Potter...and well done. <br /> <br />Accustomed as we are to rip-tide quick action packed thrillers, it takes a bit to switch to Ms. Potter's/Ms. Albert's 19th century charm and pace.  Don't be put off by the need to \\"switch gears\\"...it is a pleasure to have a different pace to a mystery.  And the characters, including animals a la Potter, are wonderful.	2005-10-09

Our state only requires 40 hours with a parent while behind the wheel, but we've made it clear we'll be requiring Mr. Berardelli's 100 hours before a license can be obtained.  Our metropolitan area lost more than 20 teens last year in traffic accidents, including one from our son's school and the wreck happened right down the street from us at 5:30pm, with no drugs or alcohol involved.

Thankfully, this one is also basically Susan Silverman-free (not that I mind Susan, it's all of the repeated conversations about their relationship - it just gets old!)<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's also Hawk-free, so the experienced reader of Spenser books will definitely miss the witty banter the two often share.

The two of these books together make excellent resource material for the NAF flute If you want a book that gives you the whole set of basics for not only history of the flute, but some of the intricacies necessary for making flutes, excellent teaching methods if you are wanting to learn how to read tablature, etc. It does an excellent job of laying out these basics with drills and songs for both the five hole flute and the six hole flute, as well as addressing the four hole flute rather well. Like I said, I have played for many years. recorded, and performed, but this flute book, definitely will help get me even further advanced than I am right now.

Societies rise, and societies fall, and in the last phase, there is always the \\"Last Man\\" as defined by Friedrich Nietzsche: someone who cares about nothing but his own comfort.

I bought it out of curiosity. Initially the book seemed brilliant, the prolouge was excellent, Paolini has described the characters in full detail not unlike the Tolkien style. As the book proceeds it starts losing some of its brilliance as it gets a totally Lord of The Rings style but that after lots of thinking the conclusion I came to was That this point should not be taken into view as the book was written by a 17 yr old rather young BOY. Lord of the Rings seems to influence almost every last page of the book but the book surely is worth reading by young and old alike even though Paolini creates a magical world followin tolkien's footsteps.	2005-10-09

Each chapter provides an account of a critical episode of Orfalea's life, his reflections on it, and some witty aphorisms based on that episode (\\"integrity is like virginity - you can lose it only once\\" etc.). The beauty of the writing style is such that these three elements are neatly interspersed without any sense of pretense or didatic tone. The ever-pervasive witty tone and self-effacing narrative style makes the book seem like a intersting novel as opposed to being an autobiography. In addition, one gets to learn interesting stories about one of the most admired companies.  The different appendices in the book provides a good snapshot of the author's personality - one of them is a long list of all people he thanks for their help! A 'collection' of his aphorisms that appear in various chapters is provided as a separate appendix for reference. That alone is worth the price of the book and will certainly make you pause and think about his words.  Though the author titled the book, \\"Copy This!\\", it is unlikely that anyone can actually copy or imitate the style of the book or of his own! A must-read.	2005-10-09

My family has owned and LOVED the first book for 4 years now.Our sons (now ages 10 and 8 years) still look at the first book and beg us to play what our family calls \\"The wacky game\\"(one person is \\"IT\\" and spots something on a page in the book while everyone else has their backs turned , and the challenge is on).When I saw this second book I thought it would be the perfect family Christmas Eve present.Boy was I WRONG!Our whole family was so dissapointed at how unchallenging the pictures where put together.We've look at it for a total of 15 mins and it's sat on the book shelf ever since.     I must say that we STILL enjoy the first book and it's always under one of the boys's pillows.	2005-10-09

It is the book for you if you have ever wondered things like:  \\"Why do we argue so much?\\"; \\"Why is the divorce rate so high?\\";  \\"What compels people to addiction?\\"; \\"I have all I ever wanted, so why am I so unhappy?\\" <br /> <br />I have personally applied the insights and lessons in this book to my own life and relationships.

I retreated to Amazon's book reviews to see if there was just cause that I should stay the course.  Armed with an overview, I tried it again.<br /><br />I'm used to straight-forward non-fiction.  This book has lots of things going for it, but clarity is not one of them, especially at the beginning.  The earthy dialogue and Mark Twain-style truisms kept me going.  Eventually, I got used to Flanagan's style and could skip most of the rereads - I came to appreciate the beauty of his sentences, didn't try to go fast, and got caught up in the story.<br /><br />The one-liners - \\"When (dirty word that starts with sh) is discovered to be valuable, poor people will be born without arseholes\\" - and such, appear on at least every other page, and lengthier discourses on the human condition punctuate every surreal idiotic adventure.  Each ridiculous character is caricaturized and Flanagan produces a truly absurd cast.<br /><br />Most of the book is monologue from the main character, who \\"never pretended to be other than where I was on the ladder - at the bottom.  Competition wasn't so fierce, my manner was not so threatening, & a few holes in the market opened up for me...opportunity for me to mollynog with some of the ladies - fine or less fine, I was never that fussed - and in the main it was fine.  Did I say tedious?  Well, yes, that too, but it had the virtue of rhythm & the pleasure of certainty.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, Gould (a name he steals) is orphaned in England at an early age.  He still manages enough education to fake a knowledge of literature and philosophy - or at least enough to do his chosen profession of con-man, counterfeiter, rabble-rouser, artist, womanizer, adventurer, and sot.  Gould flim-flams his way across England, America, and Australia, never far ahead of a jail cell.  Double crossed by one of his buddies, heis arrested on a trumped up charge and sent to a notorious penitentiary on Sarah Island in Tasmania.  To avoid hard labor, he manipulates his way into a job painting fish for the resident surgeon - when he is not seeking enlightenment with Twopenny Sal behind the pigsty.<br /><br />Numerous escapes and adventures occur that scatter enough corpses to satisfy the most bloodthirsty reader.  A story line begins to take shape involving a fabricated historical account of the prison.  Gould comes to believe Sarah Island's only true legacy  will be from words he is able to scribble between drawings in his book of fish.  The fishes he originally painted out of utility begin to acquire a mystical significance.  At the end of each escapade, Gould treats us to a moral lesson he somehow divines from one of his fish:<br /><br />\\"The idea of the past is as useless as the idea of the future.  Both could be invoked by anybody about anything.  There is never any more beauty than there is now.  There is no more sorrow or wonder than there is now, nor perfection, nor any more evil nor any more good than there is now.  I have lived a life of meaninglessness for this one moment of meaning & these thing which I now know, & the knowing of them will flee my mind & heart as abruptly as they have entered.\\"<br /><br />Unbelievably, minor and major characters reappear, and Flanagan weaves the diverse, schizophrenic parts of his story into a seamless conclusion, only to rip it back apart on the last page.  I am now about half-way through my second reading of this fascinating book.	2005-10-09

because the premise is overused and more times than not, means witnessing a heroine's petty attempts at exacting revenge against the hero who used her. not so the case in this instance. <br /> <br />lady victoria wexhall is a young woman on a mission. three years prior to the beginning of the story, she shared a passionate and mind-blowing kiss with dr. nathan oliver. she anticipated he would court her after the interlude but he instead disappeared from her life and left her embittered. now her father has sent her to dr. oliver's estate in cornwall so that she can contemplate her future plans, which includes two offers for marriage. she sees this as the perfect opportunity to get her revenge and with the aid of the scandalous book \\"A Lady's Guide to Personal Happiness and Intimate Fulfillment\\" has devised a plan to kiss and leave dr. oliver just as he left her three years ago. <br /> <br />dr. nathan oliver is a retired spy who is now a physician living in a small cottage with a menagerie of farm animals. his reputation was ruined as a result of a botched plan to steal jewels for the crown. he is thought to have betrayed the mission, which resulted in his brother and best friend being shot. while both of them lived, the hurt at their lack of faith in him and his guilt over his part in their injury forced him to leave his family for three years until he is summoned back to the family estate by victoria's father who says he has a note hidden in victoria's luggage that will help him to clear his name. <br /> <br />initially i thought this would be a story full of misunderstandings because nathan is an ex-spy and victoria is a somewhat jilted woman who i thought would harbor nothing but ill-will and suspicion towards nathan, only enhanced by his secretive behavior. imagine my surprise and relief as d'alessandro skipped over those trite plot devices and instead had nathan be honest with victoria from the very beginning. also, victoria could have been a bitter, petty heroine. instead she turned out to be anything but. <br /> <br />d'alessandro did an amazing job of creating two characters who were both intelligent, passionate, and honest with their feelings with each other while also creating the kind of sexual tension that left me breathless. as victoria and nathan embark on trying to locate the stolen jewels, the reader is able to witness them fall in love as they spend time together learning about each other and finding out all of the things they have in common, despite the fact that she's a london chit and he's a country doctor.  <br /> <br />this is a beautiful love story. nathan is sensual, loving, and honest with his feelings about victoria, even while he was afraid of the depth of those emotions. victoria, despite her plan for revenge (which was discarded pretty early in the story), is the perfect match for nathan in that she is also intelligent, courageous, sensual, and honest with her needs and desires. what a refreshing change when so many authors think an innocent heroine means she must also be stupid and afraid of her sexual needs. <br /> <br />the intimate scenes weren't graphic. in fact, while they were VERY passionate, there was more description of the emotions going on during those moments than there was of what the hero and heroine were actually doing (although the author gives us that, too). d'alessandro does a phenomenal job of depicting the passion and yearning the hero and heroine feel for each other and there is romantic gesture at the very end that had me shaking my head at the beauty of it. let me just say that nathan is a memorable hero. there are a number of romantic moments throughout the book that had me falling in love with nathan, too! <br /> <br />as for the plot about the jewels, it's little more than a plot device to get the hero and heroine together for long periods of time throughout the book, so if you're looking for a marsha canham type of adventure, this ain't that kind of story. it centers almost solely around nathan and victoria's interactions with each other, which allows the reader to view intimately the characterization and chemistry between the hero and heroine. <br /> <br />ultimately, it's like this: this is a historical where the hero and heroine are unafraid of intimacy and vulnerability, the uncontrollable yearning for intimacy is felt equally on both ends, the story itself focuses more on the growth of their relationship, and the intimate scenes are strong on emotional detail and lighter on graphical detail, and it's all done VERY WELL. <br /> <br />if you like those things, you'll love this story. i HIGHLY recommend it.	2005-10-09

So I try really hard to overlook that when I read these and concentrate on the other aspects of the book. In this case, it didn't matter anyway. This was just baaad.<br /><br />In what seems to be an effort to be more than a romance novel, something like a combo of romance novel and a spy novel, this one fails miserably. The main characters are in love and thrown into an espionage storyline within hours of meeting. One has amnesia and the other runs around a bit like a macho vigilante. The heroine, Melanie, is not the one with amnesia. The criminals are stopped, the amnesia passes almost immediately and everyone lives happily ever after. Far too complex a tale for 188 pages of a romance novel to do justice.<br /><br />Hopefully, the next time Patricia Ellis takes this road she'll be doing it for a publisher who does 300 page novels - then the tale can take some reasonable amount of time to develop. Without that time, the book was just plain bad.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks	2005-10-09

When I heard that sub-culture photographer and F--- You Hero Glen E. Friedman was self-publishing another book I got the itch real bad to see it, but when I heard it was clouds I had to wonder...really? For such an off-topic subject, Friedman really touches something here - spending five years seeing through the camera, out the window of every single flight he boarded - he produced a gorgeously slick monograph. The otherworldly atmospheric spaces are filled with Renaissance perspective but nothing at all to ground you. Made with a Pentax K1000, not some large format crap, these pictures are all at once swirly, rich, dense, soft, sexy and disappearing in an ether in front of you - Joseph Turner, Ansel Adams and Alfred Stieglitz would get in a jealous fight if they saw the symbiotic spreads in this book. There is a great and tumultuous calm reflected in these pages which you may recognize within the features of this earth and within your own being at once. Take me away.	2005-10-09

This particular period (67) is exactly what I was looking for info on.

Jacqueline Kennedy, nee Bouvier, was one of the most singularly beautiful women ever to grace the American scene, and this collection of excellent photographs is an affectionate photo album of her young years.  The composure and obvious self-possession of the young Jackie shines through in every photo, where her gaze invariably meets the camera as equal, if not an entirely welcome interloper in her rarefied world of privilege.<br /><br />Jackie is one of those people whose adult features were pretty much perfectly formed as a child;  her face would change little in the intervening years, lending an air of otherworldliness to these remarkable photographs.  There is much presecience here of the woman she would become, and curiously little given away about the kind of child she was.  Her beauty was as opaque as it was breathtaking, perhaps never more so than when she was young and did not yet know quite how striking she was.<br /><br />If you are a fan and admirer of Jackie, this book may be the very best of its kind on the market, and really belongs on your bookshelf.

These are all facts, not opinions. This book merely looked at ensuing scenarios and it hit some bulls eyes, not least of which was that the US is so over extended it finds it very difficult to wage two regional wars simultaneously. At one point during 2005, more than half of the US combat forces in Iraq were National Guard, evidence to me, if not to \\"Andrew in Indonesia\\" that US forces are overstretched. To make it even easier for \\"Andrew in Indonesia, right now, as of October 11th, 2005, 49.34% of the approximately 152,000 U.S. troops in Iraq are reservists: 49,000 Army National Guard, 22,000 Army Reserve and 4,000 Marine Reserve. During the last few months, National Guardsmen have accounted for over 50% of all US fatalities in Iraq; the US is over stetched and is cutting back troops big time in Japan and Korea to plug the gaps this book mentioned and which \\"Andrews in Indonesia\\" finds a source of amusement. Unless it intends to deploy its entire National Guard overseas, it will continue to cut troops where it can.<br />So \\"Andrew in Indonesia\\" better consider again. To say that the indisputable rise of China is anti Chinese drivel is, well, just drivel. The 2004 response to the Asian tsunami showed that India, the US and Japan can all conduct blue water operations and China currently cannot (and countries like Australia can do so to a limited extent). But times change and China will, in time, exert its power well beyond its borders just as the US currently does. China's moves will, quite naturally, be watched in India, Japan and the US. So what ails \\"Andrew in Indonesia\\"?<br />This book looked at such scenarios and with the stalemate on the Korean peninsula. It was ahead of its time. The game = as in \\"game theory\\", \\"Andrew n Indonesia\\" = has moved on and so have I. If you must read the book, do so in a library as the reforms Koizumi et al have instigated and which the book drew attention to makes it is a little dated at this stage.

Robbins selects the illustrations well; one problem with reproducing Brinkley's work in a form that does it justice is the fact that the newspaper comics pages of her heyday, in the 1910's and 1920's, were huge, and often in colour, and a small, black & white paperback isn't able to reproduce full pages without reducing it to a muddy blur. Robbins circumvents this skillfuly by focussing on Brinkley's editorial and commentary cartoons, and reproducing smaller insets from the larger pages which enable readers to appreciate the complexity and richness of Brinkley's material. <br />Yes, the book could have used a snappier title, but don't let the \\"academic tome\\" name deter you; this is a fascinating and refreshing look at an artist whose work is long overdue for a reappraisal.  <br />	2005-10-09

Nichols type illustration done in pastels on the front cover---so reminiscent of the high-strutting Parisian walking her (yikes) dog on the cover of popular diet book \\"French Women Don't Get Fat\\".  At first, I thought this was yet another dieting treatise, yet another way to capitalize on America's love/hate relationship with our cheese-loving, wine-scarfing, chocolate-chomping buddies from across the ocean who somehow after all this eating manage to fit into those tight little couture pencil skirts and red and white apache tops.  And then I saw the cat featured in the drawing---mais oui, it was a cat. Bien sur, I said, ce livre, ce n'est pas serieux; c'est une blague.<br /><br />And then I got passed those cute little illustrations and actually read it.<br /><br />Okay, I'm being a little obnoxious, but believe it or not, Henri de la Barb, in the guise of a parody, has written an even more entertaining and informative book than Mireille Guiliano.  Guiliano's book, a sucre-filled memoir containing a French arsenal of vague tips detailing how she was defeated by the battle of the bulge  America-style and had to retreat back to France and the methods of a certain Dr. Miracle to re-attain her Gitane-slim physique, contains anecdotes and recipes spread over 200+ pages.  De La Barb, offers equally compelling information that can be utilized to actually lose weight with less than half the verbage, Veuve Clicquot-free advertising and ooh-la-las.<br /><br />Okay, some of the recipes are a bit on the 'cat'astrophic side---our feline amis/amies certainly recommend mice and not mousse---but the idea of eating real food (in this case, for humans) prepared well and partaking of only a small portion seems to eptomize the best of common sense / highly nutritional dieting. Les Chats de la Barb actually eat seasonally, recommend purchasing only enough food for a day, and sum up all their tips in a shameless abbreviated mimicry of Guiliano rather arrogant much ado about nothing.<br /><br />But his cats are practical too, knowing that they will not be able to run off on a whim to the local Dean & DeLuca's just to buy the best triple cream and Valrona truffle, he makes allowances for those situations where convenience is key.<br /><br />Consequently, De La Barb's book is much more fun and speaks la verite; we laugh out loud at his prissy little pussies and their over-the-top antics, but we are not quite sure whether or not to laugh at Guiliano's pandering of her nationality and the odd mystique it has over many Americans.<br /><br />C'est une blague, n'est-ce pas?

First, it clearly and persuasively presents scientific research that shows what our children eat now will more or less determine their risk of developing cancer and other killer diseases as adults. After reading the first few pages, you will never again view sodas, donuts, fries, pizzas, candies and other \\"All-American\\" junk foods as innocent again.<br /><br />Allowing and encouraging our kids to eat this garbage on a regular basis is excusable only when we don't know what we're doing. Now that Dr. Fuhrman has exposed the truth - we can cause or prevent 99% of all diseases by what we eat - no parent who reads this book will be able to allow their child to develop \\"cancer on the installment plan\\" through malnutrition. And if you're not into long-term thinking, Dr. Fuhrman also demonstrates the link between the Standard American Diet and the national epidemics of childhood asthma, ear infections, colds, flus, and allergies.<br /><br />So a warning: do not buy this book unless you're willing to exert your responsibility to protect your children. If you read it and do nothing, you'll go through hell as you watch your kids poisoning themselves with their favorite addictive substances and starving their immune systems by not eating nutrient rich foods.<br /><br />Which brings me to the second thing this book does that no other has: it provides tools and a roadmap and a philosophy for transitioning your family to a healthy diet. Remember paint by numbers? This is the diet transition equivalent. From practical ideas (the \\"refigerator advertisements\\" is a wonderful example) to over 50 recipes (\\"string beans and almost dust\\" will blow you away with its simplicity and how much your kids will love it) to lists of delicious \\"non-recipe snacks\\" that ensure you'll always have healthy alternatives to junk fod - Disease-Proof Your Child is a well-written and well thought out \\"operations manual\\" to your most important job as a parent: setting your child up for a lifetime of health and happiness.<br /><br />In Disease-Proof Your Child, Dr. Fuhrman explains:<br /><br />- how to prepare your home for eating healthfully before making the shift<br /><br />- why \\"three meals a day\\" is a recipe for failure when it comes to feeding kids right<br /><br />- why focusing on quality, not quantity, is the key to healthy eating<br /><br />- why \\"consistent but not perfect\\" is more effective than 100% \\"compliance\\"<br /><br />- when and where it's OK to compromise<br /><br />- how to teach your kids never to \\"diet\\"<br /><br />- how to reform the picky eater<br /><br />Dr. Fuhrman is not an armchair researcher. He runs a family practice, and offers many case studies that show exactly how families transitioned successfully to a healthy diet - even when both parents thought their child's eating habits were a lost cause.<br /><br />After reading the first half of the book, you will be shocked, angry, and motivated like crazy to do something to save your kids from a lifetime of obesity and disease. The second half of the book, the solution, is going to get dog-eared and underlined and photocopied and food-spattered. You're going to want to recommend it to your friends, mostly because you won't be able to part with your own copy. I already find I need two - one for my study and another for the cookbook shelf.<br /><br />There are few books ever written that have to potential to have such a huge positive impact on the well-being of your family. Is it easy to put this into practice? Not at first. But is it worth it? Try the following thought experiment:<br /><br />It's 35 years from now. Your child is a grownup, with a kid in elementary school and another in high school. You get to choose one of the following scenarios: a) your child is a healthy and vibrant adult, at the prime of life; or b) your child has just been diagnosed with cancer, possibly fatal within 3 years.<br /><br />I know that's stark. But the links between what we feed our kids now and their health as adults are that real. Try the thought experiment for 2 minutes and see what moves within you.<br /><br />If you're not able to link current behavior with the long-term future, here's another experiment:<br /><br />What if you were able to prevent most of the ear infections, allergies, colds, feveres, and severe asthma attacks that your child gets on a regular basis? The long nights up with a crying child, the endless trips to the doctor for another round of antibiotics, the missed events, the feelings of \\"when will they outgrow it\\"? That's a real outcome too.<br /><br />Please - as a health educator, as a parent, as someone who cares about the world we're sending our kids into - I urge you to get and study this book.e links between what we feed our kids now and their health as adults are that real.

OK, who kidnapped Cormac McCarthy and then submitted a manuscript apparently written by George W. Bush in his name? This is the most disappointed I have ever been with a book. Up til now, Cormac McCarthy was one of my favorite writers. All the Pretty Horses is the best coming of age story I have ever read.   <br /> <br />This book does not seem like it was written by the same person. Chigurh is just plain evil. He is a one-dmensional villian straight out of a Steven Segal movie. Virtually all Mexicans are 1-D lawless thugs.  <br /> <br />The sheriff's wife is just plain good.  The sheriff is at least 99% just plain good, but can't forgive himself for the one time in his life where he might have been 1% bad. The syrupy descriptions of their marriage were nauseatingly simplistic. Who really acts like that?  <br /> <br />Much of the first two thirds of the book was focused on a character named Moss who had an irritating habit of never directly answering a question, even when doing so would make him and the person he was with significantly less likely to be brutally murdered.  Which of course does happen, but inexplicably it happens \\"offscreen\\" as another disgusted reviewer wrote. <br /> <br />One character states this and we are meant to nod our heads solemnly: The problem with the Vietnam war was that the boys did not take Jesus with them over there.  Seriously, ink and paper that I ended up paying for were used to make this inane statement. <br /> <br />There was no subtle symbolism in this book as is found in many of his other books.  Eavangelical christianity is stuffed down the readers throat with a Texas-sized red-hot poker.  <br /> <br />I will probably never buy another Cormac McCarthy book. I guess I could see it coming with Cities of the Plain which was also not very good, but at least it did not make me angry.   <br /> <br />Do not waste your money on this book.  Watch reruns of George W. Bush saying that Jesus was his favorite political philosopher or talking about the Butcher of Baghdad and you will get the idea.	2005-10-09

I want everyone to read it, including Congress; I want to go out with my own box and get suggestions; I want to move to NY and join Illegal Art; I want to hear a suggestion from every single person in America. This book is the basis of democracy - everyone has a chance to speak, even the person who crossed out what s/he said and then put it in the box anyway. The Wall St. section is not given more play than the subway ride to Yankee Stadium. Wealthy white males are not over-represented. People say absolutely ridiculous things, and profound, moving things, and idiotic things. There's a feeling of truth in the book that is enormously powerful for me. Maybe because contributors were allowed their anonymity. But in seeing their handwriting (suggestions were reproduced directly, not transcribed), and what they say, I got such a feeling of humanity! It made me happy to be an American, which very few things do these days. Suggestion somehow gets under all the hype and dross and grandstanding and gives us a taste of ordinary freedom.

For instance, they completely misinterpret the results of molecular phylogeny, because they do not understand that a modern fish and a modern man are equally remote in time from their last common ancestor.  This leads them to conclude that the data favor separate creation rather than common descent, whereas the exact reverse is true.<br /><br />This book was written to support the claim that Intelligent Design theory should be considered as a scientific alternative to evolution and common descent. But the theory itself is never clearly stated.  In particular, there is no explanation of how the design comes to be incorporated into actual living beings. Absent such explanation, the origin of each species requires a separate and mysterious act, and Intelligent Design is just another name for Creationism.	2005-10-09

As with KRAKATOA, Winchester in A CRACK AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD takes a momentous geological event--in this case, the great San Francisco Earthquake of 1906--and proceed to tell us as many stories leading up to and out of it as he possibly can, covering not merely accounts of the event itself (particularly the disastrous fires that came from it) but also ways of understanding the event within its multiple contexts. He tells us much about the commerical and social history of California as well as of the geology of the San Andreas Fault, Iceland, Missouri, Indonesia... s you can see, at times it _does_ get a little much. Winchester loves to amble through all these events at his own pace, but the result is a book that often reads as if it were hardly edited. His prose leaps about with weak transitions (along the lines of \\"As we have seen earlier,\\" \\"And this brings us to Enrico Caruso,\\" \\"And this is not the first time he shall appear in these pages, as we shall see,\\" etc.) and seems as irruptive and eruptive as the events he chronicles; his intriguing and edifying narrative would have surely benefited from more studied editing and more careful organization. There's a wonderful book buried in here, but as with some of Winchester's earlier books this seems rushed and undigested.	2005-10-09

On one level it's an implausible plot with characters who all seem to be stereotypes in which the good guys triumph over the bad guys. But in the hands of a master storyteller, the characters feel like people you know, the plot carries you along from one crazy twist to another, and you anxiously await the next page. You find yourself laughing out loud at some of the dialog and antics of this collection of unforgettable characters. The sons of Maxwell Broadbent are all different: the pompous wannabe, the gullible seeker, and the cowboy dreamer. Then there's Broadbent himself, a collector -- no hoarder -- of art and ancient artifacts, the quintessential wealthy eccentric.<br /><br />As their search for their lost legacy takes them into the wild jungle, Broadbent's sons meet even more weird characters, including an Indian guide who makes sexist jokes! You also have a greedy pharmaceutical corporate mogul and a cigar-chomping sleazy detective, along with a beautiful woman with the improbable name of Sally Colorado who can ride horses bareback and make medicines out of jungle plants.<br /><br />Put all these people into one skillfully-written novel and you have a reader's delight. As with all great stories, the characters go through harrowing, life-changing experiences and gain self-insights as a result. Despite the light touch of this tale, the reader too can ponder what lessons were learned from the jungle journey of these characters. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and was only sorry when I came to the end - an end with some surprises I did not see coming. The author has done a magnificent job with this story, and I give it a rare (for me) five stars.	2005-10-09

This book is ideal for that purpose: educating the layperson. It is a book written in simple terms that only lightly touches on the topics contained in its pages. It contains purely factual information, although, some of it, particularly those involving Satanism and Satan, take on a Judeo-Christian biased slant. However, as these are RECORDED by the church, they still must be acknowledged as fact, regardless of validity. <br /> <br />This book also functions well as an immediate, concise reference, but by all means, as with any reference, seek more material. <br />	2005-10-09

The story itself is a relatively simple one.  Set in London under siege of the WWII Blitz from the very start we find the body of a brutally murdered woman--the fourth found in a short period of time.  We then watch events unfold from the past leading up to this inevitable but terrifying act through the eyes of three people: a young fighter pilot with a disturbing secret, a prostitute with a child to support, and a young female office worker learning the ways of the world in this devastating setting.  The beauty of each nerrative is how authentic each sounds as the chapters alternate from one character's point of view to another.  This technique allows the reader to view events from different perspectives and provides unusual character depth, but it also builds nervy suspense as the reader becomes attached to these characters and doesn't quite know the what will happen to them.  We think one of them will be killed (as shown in the beginning), but who?  The intertwining nerratives also reflect the upredictable intertwining of these three lives leading up to that one tragic, inevitable murder.  Laura Wilson creates an authentic, atmospheric rendering of WWII London, and its denizens struggling to survive it through the brutal events.  I can't imagine what it would have been like to survive it, but the author has done that for me brilliantly.	2005-10-09

A chronology of America's past from the arrival of the first Americans to the present day, this book presents the events that shaped our country in a way that is understandable and compelling.  Cheney's organization of the book-it passes through history in date order, with short summaries of events instead of complicated explanations-gives the reader a sense of context that is rare in history literature, yet essential for understanding our national story.  I learned that in 1968 alone, North Vietnam launched the Tet Offensive; assassins murdered Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy; police used tear gas against antiwar activists at the Chicago Democratic convention; and women protested the Miss America Pageant, in that order.  Understanding this national suffering is surely necessary if we are to appreciate the hope that Neil Armstrong inspired across the country when, in early 1969, he became first person to walk on the moon! <br /> <br />Cheney has also filled the book with primary source quotations, images, and fascinating tidbits that, even as a college history student, I've never found anywhere else (for example, during World War II, Navajo Indians serving in the Marines used their native language to keep U.S. transmissions from being deciphered by the Japanese). Such rich information and captivating prose make A Time for Freedom the perfect gift for a student, a family, or (perhaps best of all), a busy adult who can't remember what she learned in American history class.  I predict that this book will become a classic-and until then, I'm going to give it to everyone I know.  <br />	2005-10-09

It makes me wonder if Hornby has experienced depression himself, because the character's narratives of their emotional bottoming-out feel so authentic.  But please don't steer clear of this book because the characters are depressed- this is not a depressing book!  It is unique and unpredictable, and very funny at times.  There is also a sense of warmth to the book as the characters make connections to each other and start taking steps to widen the scope of their lives.

Since it was written during the mid-1860's, the writing style is perhaps a bit different from what we are used to nowadays, but not distractingly so.  This farmer knows how to tell a story.  He starts with his longing to leave the city, leads us through his search for an affordable property and then lets us follow him as he chooses his crops -- among them, 804 peach trees at 7 cents a piece, all dutifully \\"tarred\\" to prevent worms -- and markets the produce  for the first few years on the farm.  Along the way, he scatters fascinating tidbits about his life.  One of my favorites is the story of his blackberry plants.  While living in town, he had read of a new kind of blackberry that intrigued him, and though it was a very unheard of thing to do at the time, he orderd six of the plants by mail, at the princely sum of five dollars.  When the plants arrived, he was shocked at their size and appearance.  \\"They looked like long white worms, with here and there a bud or an eye\\" and was too embarassed to admit to his wife that he paid so much for them.  But he planted them and tended them, and the next year had a magnificent crop of berries, and so finally admitted to the cost.  He and his wife agreed it was a bargain at that, and since they loved the berries so much, they dug up the plants and took them along to their new farm.  There, the berries attracted the attention of neighbors and nurserymen, and by being one of the first suppliers in the area, he was able to sell $460 worth of blackberry plants that first year on the farm -- quite a return on his initial five dollar investment.<br /><br />There's more, and he catalogs it all:  the cow that worked out well and the chickens that didn't, the way his neighbors thought him insane for battling the never-ending weeds, the value he saw in small birds, the money spent on load after load of manure, and mostly, the satisfaction of it all.  There really is no substitute for farming done this way,where taking care of the land itself is still a priority, and the crops a source of pride.  So if you are even the slightest bit interested in coming to the country in search of something better, I encourage you to read this book.  Initially, I hesitated to buy it, figuring that it would be too irrelevant and dated, but no, it's not.  It's absorbing.  And though I can't find peach trees for 7 cents a piece today, the story is the same.  And if you don't find yourself living in the country soon enough to suit you, you'll at least have had the pleasure of sharing Edmund Morris's farm for awhile.	2005-10-09

It seems improbable that someone could develop mysteries centering around the life, character and times of Beatrix Potter, famed 19th century author of The Tale of Peter Rabbit and other much loved children's stories.  But Susan Albert Wittig has - and she succeeds in creating a very special type of mystery in the imagined voice of Beatrix Potter, even down to her special kind of animal characters. <br /> <br />This is the second in the series, Holly How being the farm from which Ms. Potter purchases sheep for her own farm from aging tenant farmer Ben Hornby.  When she goes to collect the sheep, she discovers Ben Hornby dead, apparently from an accidental fall.  The death is soon found to be murder. <br /> <br />Holly How is part of Tidmarsh Manor, a large estate belonging to an eldery and difficult widow.  Also at Tidmarsh Manor live her young granddaughter, an orphan recently arrived from New Zealand, and her disagreeable companion, Mable Martine. <br /> <br />The mysteries revolve around the events at Holly How and Tidmarsh Manor.  The story is well done. The use of Ms. Potter as a character together with all the other many characters, including many Beatrix Potter-like animals, is unusual and highly successful. <br /> <br />This is very different from most of \\"mysteries\\" I read.  While it took a bit to get into the mind and times of Beatrix Potter, I am delighted with the unexpected change of pace.  The first in this series, The Tale of Hill Top Farm, is very good; The Tale of Holly How is even better.  (But, do read them in order.)  I am really looking forward to the next and subsequent additions to this series.	2005-10-09

These are families made up of Witches and their Protectors, living in the England of the Middle Ages. They know their situation is dire, and they struggle fiercely against the widening impositions of the Church. They fight to the death to maintain the sanctity of their beliefs, their rites and their beloved Goddess. <br />Croll Di Dio's descriptions are both heartwarming and heartbreaking. We ride alongside legendary heros and heroines full of strength and single-minded determination, who are sometimes aided by magic and sometimes alone. These are people who are committed to each other, who feel community and family are one and the same. We undeniably feel their emotions through all the joys they share and the calamities they endure. <br />And best of all, you get to spend more time with all the wonderful people you met in \\"Sherwood Forest,\\" plus an extra one or two. It is an exciting, sometimes erotic and always spellbinding work of fiction, and I recommend it highly.	2005-10-09

When the author lacks evidence, he simply speculates by saying things like \\"it seems\\" and notes how his conclusion is \\"evident\\".  Rather than always citing to evidence, he favors political commentary and other biased sources.  When I was pleasently suprised to find an unbiased reference, more often than not the author provided a slanted interpretation of it (often through omission).  Lastly, the author blatantly misrepresents the legal aspects of international law in favor of how the author would like international law to be.  As an attorney who works in international law, I found this to be the book's greatest flaw.  In sum, this book is little more than an anti-American rant presented in a academic format.  I do not recommend purchasing this book.	2005-10-09

We read it in class as an example of the terrors enforced upon America's Native Americans around 1870, and in this sense, it's a very effective piece of historical fiction. As a narrative, it encapsulates the reader within the Blackfeet tribe unlike any other book I've ever read. Everything tribal custom is discussed: religion, tribal structure, and the effect of Westward Expansion as mentioned earlier. The only real beef I have with 'Fools Crow' is the ending, which frustrated me on a level previously unfathomable (The ending is also why I gave the book a 4 and not a 5), but if you're looking for good historical fiction, check this one out.	2005-10-09

In 1921,in his A Treatise on Probability(TP),J M Keynes pointed out that the purely mathematical conception of probability was a very small subset of what he called the logical theory of probability.In order to apply the purely mathematical laws of probability correctly,a decision maker had to have a complete sample space of all possible outcomes specified in advance.An equivalent assumption is that the decision maker knows for certain what the particular probability distribution is.Secondly,probability preferences would have to be specified by a complete order that was linear or proportional.Any decision situation that did not satisfy these conditions had a weight of evidence less than one.Keynes specified a variable,w,called the weight of the evidence,that measured the completeness of the relevant,potential evidence that was available to the decision maker.It was defined on the unit interval between 0 and 1,just like Ellsberg's rho variable that would serve as a measure of the ambiguity of the evidence.The existence of ambiguity automaticaly will lead to violations of the purely mathematical laws of probability.Contrary to Kahneman and Tversky,Ellsberg,like Keynes before him,argued that these calculations are not erroneous and the decision makers are not irrational or biased.The claims made by Tversky, Kahneman and their many followers(Shiller,for example),that the subjects in their experiments are probabilistically and statistically illiterate,makes no sense because the problems that are presented to the experimental subjects do not allow the subjects to unambiguously define a unique probability distribution or a complete sample space of all possible outcomes(some  examples are the blue-green taxi cab problem,the rare Asian disease problem,the battlefield problem,the Linda-bankteller problem,and the lawyer-engineer problem).Let us now turn to the representativeness heuristic.The representativeness heuristic turns out to be none other than Keynes's degree of similarity or likeness or resemblance discussed by Keynes in chapter 3 and Part III of the TP.The anchoring and availability heuristics are identical to the statement that the weight of the evidence is less than 1 for a real world decision maker.Keynes showed that decision makers would usually be able to use interval estimates(upper-lower probabilities) only.You automatically will violate the mathematical laws of probability,which only hold in the limiting case where w=1,given linear probability preferences.Keynes also showed this in his examples of his conventional coefficient of weight and risk,c.The answers obtained when one applies the c coefficient will be sub and super additive.Keynes ,however,would argue that these are not biases or errors,but correct calculations obtained with incomplete information.The vast majority of decision makers are attempting to reason probabilistically without the benefit of knowing a unique probability distribution,a complete sample space,or being able to specify a complete order over all outcomes.They are rational.Tversky and Kahneman are requiring \\"SUPERRATIONALITY\\".Every calculation of a probability estimate that does not have a weight of 1 or violates Carnap's rule of total evidence will violate the mathematical laws of probability.L J Cohen,repeating Keynes's argument,spent 20 years trying to get this point across to Kahneman and Tversky in  the journal Brain and Behavioral Science(1975-1994) .Tversky's support theory is a belated attempt to remedy their omission,but it has not been successfuly integrated into Prospect theory(1979)or Cumulative Prospect theory(1992),where the weighting function is still  a function of a single variable representing probability,although additional parameters have been incorporated into the model.One could argue that it is Tversky and Kahneman who are irrationally insisting that decision makers use the mathematical laws of probability

Having heard a lot about Brian McLaren it was good to be able to actually read his stuff... I was pleasantly surprised.    I agree with his diagnosis of the \\"modern church\\", although I think it reflects his own cultural experiences in America. He doesn't clearly distinguish between 'fundamentalists' (those who hold to the truth but disengage with culture) and 'evangelicals' (those who hold to truth but try to reconcile it with culture). This failure to distinguish leads him to smear everyone with the mistakes of some.    My experience of the church in America has led me to similar conclusions. There are some parts that are more thoughtful, but they are not the majority. Too much is nationalistic, proud, franchised and fraternal. [Note the shreaks of outrage and vitriol poured out by some reviewers listed here!]    The other most valuable thing about McLaren's book is his positive attitude to post-modernism. Too many critiques come from an attitude of being threatened by it and trying to tear it down. This is a waste of time, since it is like trying to stop the wind. Rather, we need to know how to set the sails to ride this breeze, just as we have those winds of change in the past.    I do disagree with McLaren's medication for the illness prescribed. I agree we need to re-engage with the Scripture to address the issues we presently face. A deeper study of the Kingdom of God proves fruitful (see N.T. Wright's stuff). I don't know if I anyone I have heard or read has defined the gospel as \\"salvation from hell\\"... at least not in the last several decades. I hope that is an example of hyperbole for McLaren. Salvation has always been understood as a past, present and future experience... and if we teach anything less we are less than biblical.    My fear is that too much of the emerging church adjustments depend on a \\"churched culture\\" - prevalent in many areas of America, but not in Australia.    Finally, I fear some emerging church people interpret this journey away from modernism as justifying the rejection of systematic Christian doctrines. McLaren himself (through his characters) defends the value of systematic theology... but ascribes it to the modernist church. What needs to be added is that we should value each of the contributions of those who have gone before us as we struggle with the issues relevant to our own time. [e.g. noone in the church struggles with Jesus divinity-humanity, once a major source of conflict within the church; now the struggle is over such things as the role of women in ministry and how to deal with sexuality issues].	2005-10-09

Ever since, I have read numerous books by said author.  But Plain Truth wasn't my favorite.  Although, Picoult has a flair for character development by bringing the reader inside the psyche of most of Plain Truth's characters, she falls short on her presentation of conflict resolution and character consistency.<br /><br />Her characters are flawed and we love them for that; they are believeable.  In reading Picoult's presentation of character relations (e.g. Katie and Adam; Ellie and Coop) we can't help but notice our own relationships; therfore, the catharsis is the thing wherein she catches the conscience of the  . . . reader.<br /><br />The plot clips along carefully giving the reader enough questions to require luminous midnight page-turning sessions. I simply couldn't put the novel down at times, and I love when that happens.  However, the denoucement, although a classic Picoult twist, is anything but satisfactory.  The reader discovers small character inconsistencies in hindsight, and this becomes discrediting.<br /><br />The story's characters still reverberate in my mind, however. And as Martha Stewart would say, \\"That's a good thing.\\"  Salem Falls, Second Glance, and Keeping Faith still remain my favorite Picoult works.  I am, however, still plowing the casm of the Picoult canon.	2005-10-09

But he is old enough to be her grandfather and Iola is NOT thrilled!  Having been raised by a loving nanny who still keeps in touch, Iola runs off to ask her advice.  I won't spoil the part where she visits the nanny.  It turns out to be a unique situation.  I will tell you how descriptions of Nanny sharing fanciful stories and love to Iola as they reminisce about her childhood show how this wonderful woman shaped Iola into a lovely young lady.         Iola ends up as nanny to a sweet little girl who acts so grown up.  (How Iola happens to get this position is part of what you must read in the visit to Nanny).  Lucy (the little girl) has a very rich father, Sir Wolfe Renton.  He cares about Lucy (but is not over-attentive) and does not want her head filled with fanciful stories and informs Iola of this.  Iola tries not to pass on her imagination but is unsuccessful.  She also comes to love Lucy.  Lucy soaks up the affection like a sponge.  There are some funny situations as a very precocious Lucy converses with Lady Isabel, a rather conniving woman who desires to be Sir Wolfe's mistress (and perhaps blackmail him also).      Throw in beautiful locations as the \\"house party\\" of Sir Wolfe sails upon his yacht to the south of France and the adventure of a kidnapping and you have an amusing afternoon read.

While one may encounter shadows of post-diasporic experience in the stories, \\"Casual Water\\" and \\"Yellow\\", Lee does not preoccupy readers with plot lines most often associated with the work of more commonly known Asian-American writers. <br /> <br />Instead, he illustrates well the various issues assimilated Asian-Americans face as they live in a country where occasionally, they are reminded of their immigration status, regardless of whether they have been born in the United States. For Lee, race politics includes a Chinese thug who questions his Korean-American attorney about his white girlfriend in \\"Voir Dire\\", presuming that a white girlfriend automatically indicates a form of race treachery. Annie Yung, in the delightful, \\"Lone Night Cantina\\", assumes a cowgirl identity only to find herself facing the problems with assuming an identity that is not authentic to her person.  <br /> <br />Some Asian-American students will react to Yellow by arguing that they do not find Lee's characters \\"Asian\\" enough which begs the question: What does it mean to be Asian/Asian-American and what are the risks of narrowly-defining characteristics that ultimately lead to essentialism. Feminists have been right to point out how essentialism damages women and similarly, readers can bring their assumptions to the book so long as they understand that reading Lee's work may cast new light and perhaps, widen the spectrum of race representation. Readers who presume to know what \\"Asian\\" is may find themselves struggling with Lee's honest portrayal which avoids reinforcing images of Asian-Americans as perpetually struggling, self-hating, or striking nationalistic attitudes. Marked with a fluidity of language and expression, Lee's affection for his characters allows them genuine epiphanies without sentimentalism.  <br />	2005-10-09

In reading a book entitled \\"A Century of Recorded Music\\" I was expecting to run across a cross-section of recorded music rather then a series of lists pertaining only to the recording of classical music.  In this sense the title should have a disclaimer letting the reader know that there will be pratically no mention of jazz or popular music.  There is some mention of oral history and ethnic music, but the brunt of the book looks at classical development as it was influenced by recording and popular demand.  I gave it three stars because I felt that some of the space for lists could have been better used to compare and contrast the parallel development of other recorded genre's which would have given a perspective on classical music as well as the others - without it we have nothing to develop a perspective to.	2005-10-09

She has captured the true essence of the \\"happenings\\" during that era in Guyana, one I can whole heartedly relate to, especially of Kitty the city I was born and grew up around. Her dialogue brought back so many funny and sad childhood memories; it was however a great place to grow up. As you read this story, an image appears coupled with our \\"tantalizing\\" speaking dialogue and island music. This should be made into a Guyanese movie. I have encouraged many of my Guyanese Friends to read this book, and given it to several of my \\"American generation family\\" of children to help them understand the atmosphere that we of the 40's, 50's, 60's and early 70's grew up in.

But here's the BEST part.  Brad Cohen is a man with a great sense of humor,a deep inner strength, and a wise sense of observation of the human race. As Brad chronicles the events of his life and the massive obstacles that he overcame due to Tourettes Syndorme, you cry, you laugh and you get angry.

It's one of those rare books that began as a children's tale and ended up considerably adult 30-some years down the line.  This happens to a great many children's books over time.  \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\", \\"Alice's Adventures In Wonderland\\", and others all began with kids as the intended audience but later ended up in the hands of scholarly adults everywhere.  Such is the fate of the remarkably well-written \\"A Long Way From Verona\\".  A thoughtful book that considers what it is to be a writer, one girl's battle with the crippling depression of adolescence, and some mild magical realism for kicks, this is a mighty intelligent 190 pages.  It's funny, insightful, and one of the few books that I will concede that adults will enjoy far more than children.<br /><br />Jessica Vye cannot tell a lie.  Or rather, she probably could but she would prefer not to.  Growing up in the middle of World War II and attending an all girls local school, Jessica has been having some difficulty with certain members of the educational staff.  She's occasionally abrasive but always amusing to listen to and has a far clearer eye than most of the adults around her.  She is convinced that she can be a writer by an elderly author at the start of the book, and as such she dedicates herself to her own style.  The rest of \\"A Long Way From Verona\\" follows suit, with Jessica doing exactly what she wants in the face of those with more power around her.  By the book's end she has grappled with what it means to be happy in this world in spite of all its misery and has been ultimately redeemed in terms of her own writing.<br /><br />By the time I finished reading this book, I found that I had been continually comparing it to 1972's mighty similar, \\"A Sound of Chariots\\", by Mollie Hunter.  In both cases, English girls growing up during and after major world wars deal with their communist/socialist fathers and defy authority at every turn.  I wish heartily that I had read, \\"Chariots\\", only after reading \\"Verona\\", since Gardam's book was not only the first written but is also more amusing as a whole.  Gardam is not afraid to dive deep into the world of biting satire.  Some of the best passages in this book come when Jessica reluctantly stays a week-end with some rich neighbors on their own insistence.  These people are the kind of pink-cheeked, healthy, all-British family that you'd see on greeting cards or advertisements.  Their relentlessly cheerful and utterly and completely awful.  For a brief amount of time, Jessica falls for the family's son, Christian, a boy who adores her father for his articles about human dignity in the New Statesman.  In my favorite passage, Christian decides that Jessica has never seen any slums and takes her to see one.  The thing is, Christian is coming from a very privileged background.  The area that he repeatedly calls \\"hell\\" is, to Jessica's eyes, not so bad.  As he tries to convince her that she's in the worst place in the world, Jessica just says, \\"Well, I think I expected green slime or something.  Just shacks and green slime.  I mean I haven't seen anywhere worse exactly ... But if they planted a few trees ... If it was all painted white, and it was in Africa or somewhere and they had bright-colored clothes\\".<br /><br />I love this.  And this is the tone of the book in general.  What makes Gardam so remarkable is that \\"A Long Way From Verona\\" has a very modern voice.  Jessica is cynical in a very contemporary way.  Her father has become a curate, though this is the Church of England we're talking here.  Nothing too relentlessly spiritual.  At one point Jessica is sick in bed and she asks her father to remove a particularly sickly picture of, \\"Jesus as a boy with curly yellow hair, holding out his hands above a lot of rabbits\\".  Her father agrees instantly that it has to go and with a flourish shoves it under the bed with a \\"Goodbye\\".  Gardam also zeroes in on that peculiar phenomenon where girls in their early teens fixateon depressing literature.  Jessica reads \\"Jude the Obscure\\" and can't stop thinking of it.  Girls today read, \\"The Lovely Bones\\" and \\"A Child Called It\\" and feel the same way.  It's marvelous.  If I've any objections to this book at all, it might be the name.  Who on earth is going to pick up a book called, \\"A Long Way From Verona\\"?  It has almost nothing to do with the book, aside from Jessica's decision not to read Shakespeare's, \\"Romeo and Juliet\\".  Far better to name it, \\"The Maniac\\" after her prize-winning poem or, heck, \\"Green Bezzums\\".  I vote for the latter.<br /><br />It should come as no surprise that Gardam's book reads better from an adult perspective than a childish one.  Just look at her more recent novels and you can see that she has given up writing for children entirely.  Whether this is because she realizes that her voice is better appreciated by people over the age of 22, or because her publishers and editors are forever steering her away from a younger audience, I do not know.  I do wish that this book might get a re-release under an adult publisher and be rediscovered by humanity as a whole.  Until that happens, however, it's just going to remain one of those amazing little secrets.  A book that pleases everyone who reads it and deserves more attention.

US	13256853	R11YIVDNVEO3G7	0425191184	17508097	Red Rabbit (Tom Clancy)	Books	1	6	8	N	N	This is a really bad book	Following the distastrous (and downright offensive) \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\", I was left wondering where Tom Clancy was going to go. Apparently he was wondering the same thing, because for \\"Red Rabbit\\", apparently seeing how there was little life left in his current \\"Ryanverse\\", decided to go back in time to the Cold War era where his earlier (and far superior) novels had been set. Unfortunately, Red Rabbit fails to make amends for \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\", and in many ways ends up being far worse. <br /> <br />\\"Red Rabbit\\" deals with the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II in 1981. In Clancy's story, the KGB are ones the behind it, and when an employee of the KGB named Oleg Zaitzev hears about it, he has a sudden crisis of conscience and decides to defect to the Americans and reveal the assassination plot. \\"Red Rabbit\\" is the story of how he and his family escape from Soviet Russia with the aid of the CIA, with our hero Jack Ryan being stationed in the UK and only playing a supporting role. <br /> <br />Right away, the storyline's flaw becomes apparent. Being based on actual historical events, we know the Pope gets shot, thus removing all tension and buildup. But the most egregious decision on Clancy's part is that the whole bit about Zaitsev's covert defection has absolutely no suspence or climax. I do not mean that it's simply lacking in the those elements, I mean that they are literally not there. The process of getting Zaitsev out of the USSR goes off completely without a hitch, with nary a hiccup along with the way. The whole book builds up to his escape, and completely fails to pay off. There's no real conclusion or denouement; it just...ends. I was left feeling distinctly cheated and miffed after reading tedious page after page only to be denied any sort of satisfactory ending. It's like reading a heist story that's spends chapter after chapter detailing the planning of the heist, but before they can implement their plan, the police sweep in and arrest everyone since they had them under surveillance the whole time. Clancy appears unwilling to make his \\"good guys\\" seem anything less than all-powerful (otherwise known as the \\"Mary Sue\\" phenomenon), and his stories suffer greatly for it. <br /> <br />The characters of \\"Red Rabbit\\" are flat and two dimensional. We aren't given any reason for Zaitsev's sudden change of heart, he just decides to up and defect with no buildup to it at all. Clancy's method of \\"character development\\" is nothing more than him expounding endlessly on each character's boundless competence. Of course Jack Ryan loves his wife and children. Of course he's a brilliant at analysing the stock market. Of course he has a Ph.D. Here's a hint, Clancy. When you make your protagonist's perfect and bereft of flaws, they suddenly become a whole lot less interesting. <br /> <br />As for Clancy's writing style, which was always rather pedestrian in the first place, it's sad to see that he has not improved at all after \\"The Bear and the Dragon\\". His insistence on reusing words and phrases once again rears its ugly head. \\"Spook\\", \\"Pshrink\\" and \\"Puke\\" get thrown about page after page, almost becoming self-parodying. We hear incessantly about how Ryan hates flying, how he was a marine, how communism is bad, how America is great... it all becomes dreadfully wearing. Clancy's tendency for characters to engage in long, often pointless bits of internal exposition is back as well, bloating the novel and making it tiresome to read. Worst of all, his narrow-minded and shallow political rants are in full force, as there is an entire subplot devoted to how Ryan's wife Cathy is shocked by two British doctors having a drink during a break, the whole purpose of which is to slam the British public health care system. A system where millions cannot afford healthcare is superior, apparently. <br /> <br />In all, \\"Red Rabbit\\" marks a definite low point in Clancy's career. I could find absolutely no redeeming qualities within its pages, and I was left simply wanting back the hours I had spent reading it. Definately one to avoid.	2005-10-09

But here is a circular issued by the Lumamba Govt. <br /> <br />On September 15 he issued the following lengthy and highly revealing directive to the heads of the various provinces throughout the Congo: <br /> <br /> SUBJECT: Measures To Be Applied During the First Stages of the Dictatorship. <br /> <br />Sir, <br /> <br />I have the honour and the pleasure to inform you that with a view to the rapid restoration of order in the country, the House of Representatives and the Senate [of the central government], meeting in special session on 13 September of this year, decided to grant the government full powers. <br /> <br />Full powers should be understood to mean that the government is free to act as it thinks fit in all respects, for the purpose of suppressing abuses, disorders and any action which is contrary to the will of the government over which I have presided legally since the attainment of independence by the Congo. . . . <br /> <br />The most effective and direct means of succeeding rapidly in our task may be summarized as follows: <br /> <br />1. Establish an absolute dictatorship and apply it in all its forms. <br /> <br />2. Terrorism, essential to subdue the population. <br /> <br />3. Proceed systematically, using the army, to arrest all members of the opposition. I will be personally responsible for those at Leopoldville including the Head of State and his close supporters. A few weeks ago, in view of the present situation in Katanga and Sud-Kasai, I sent the National Army to arrest Tshombe and Kalonji and even to kill them if possible. . . . <br /> <br />4. Imprison the ministers, deputies and senators, who sometimes abuse their parliamentary immunity. In such a case I should be glad if you would not spare them but arrest them all without pity and treat them with ten times more severity than ordinary individuals. <br /> <br />5. Revive the system of flogging and give the rebels 10 lashes, morning and evening, for a maximum of 7 consecutive days. <br /> <br />N.B. Double the number in the case of ministers, senators, and deputies, reducing the number gradually according to the condition of each individual. <br /> <br />6. Inflict profound humiliations on the people thus arrested, in addition to the obligatory treatment described above. For example, strip them in public, if possible in the presence of their wives and children. Make them carry heavy loads and force them to walk about in that state. In case of such a walk, however, drawers may be worn. <br /> <br />7. In view of the seriousness of the situation of the country, which is in danger of sinking into anarchy, it would be well to imprison repeated offenders in underground cells or prisons for at least six months, never allowing them out to breathe fresh air. <br /> <br />N.B. If some of them succumb as a result of certain atrocities, which is possible and desirable, the truth should not be divulged but it should be announced, for instance, that Mr. X has escaped and cannot be found. <br /> <br />8. Those who do not succumb in prison should not be released for at least a year. In this case they shall be exiled to a country to be determined by me in agreement with certain foreign countries which have already signified their agreement in principle. <br /> <br />Some of the provincial presidents will say that the measures described are severe. In reply I would point out to them that certain politicians have attained power by means of dictatorship. Moreover, the measures of execution that I have indicated above constitute only the first stage of the basic regime that we hope will succeed in the Congo. The second stage will be to destroy anyone who criticizes us. . . . <br /> <br />In conclusion, I would point out that this letter should be communicated only to those authorities under your orders in whom you have entire confidence. <br /> <br />(signed) P. LUMUMBA <br />Prime Minister <br />  <br />I see no point in removing the Belgians just to put in someone worse.	2005-10-09

It did take me a long time to finish, and while I cannot comment on whether the fact of translation (which I always suspect when I slowly read applicable novels in English) or the details amassed by Kohout were the cause, the density of atmosphere as Prague struggles to free itself from its captivity as the capital of the Reich's Protectorate makes for a fittingly somber and moving fictional thriller, combined with a thoughtful meditation, thanks especially to Gestapo functionary Buback and his love Grete, on how decent people can redeem themselves--and perhaps others--from barbarity for which they have been too long its too complacently silent perpetrators.<br /><br />This added depth to an already intricate whodunit enriches the plot. It's not perfect. A map should have been added for the benefit of readers not familiar with Prague's byways. Even as a repeat visitor there, I wished for some guidance, as much of the action in the later chapters depends upon the barricades and escapes among its city streets and districts, as the German and native elements make their assaults and retreats.<br /><br />The action itself, although it starts finally to intensify after the news of Hitler's suicide begins to encourage and discourage the novel's various characters, might have moved along far quicker; although the novel never bogged down, it did wander off on detours that detracted from the intensity of its central clash between liberators and oppressors. I do not read mysteries or thrillers normally, so I may be not the best critic of such genre conventions regarding pacing. The murders, thinking about it in retrospect, uneasily shift from those of psycho-sexual delusion to those excused on behalf of a vengeful populace, and although this transfer is less than smoothly accomplished, it does perhaps represent more accurately the sudden jerks of the crazed mind rather than the controlling author.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, I'd love to read more about some of the key figures as the Czech democrats succumbed to the Communists, and certainly Kohout's own age and experience would make him an excellently placed observer and chronicler. In the meantime, this novel may not describe much of the beloved postcard Prague, but conjures up the sinister shadows that, when I walked along Bartolemeska street, I could still enter, left by decades of its prominence as the dark facades where the police and the jail loomed even as the flags changed.ce, and although this transfer is less than smoothly accomplished, it does perhaps represent more accurately the sudden jerks of the crazed mind rather than the controlling author.  <br /> <br />As I stated earlier, I'd love to read more about some of the key figures as the Czech democrats succumbed to the Communists, and certainly Kohout's own age and experience would make him an excellently placed observer and chronicler.

When I began THE HISTORIAN, Elizabeth Kostova's epic take on the legend of Dracula, I did so with trepidation.  When I first heard about the novel, I couldn't wait to read it--I harbor a morbid fascination for anything macabre, especially if it is rooted in reality--but by the time I got my hands on it, I had read many negative reviews here on Amazon, heralding the novel as nothing more than a dry, academic travelogue of Eastern Europe and as an overall disappointing first offering by Kostova.  But when I began the novel, I at first believed my reservations were unwarranted; I found myself immediately sucked into Kostova's thrilling world of timeless legends and ancient manuscripts, of castle ruins and hidden sarcophagi. But it wasn't long before I began to understand the points of view of some of the other reviewers here: I ultimately enjoyed the book (though I was dissatisfied with certain elements--more on that later), but THE HISTORIAN is definitely not a novel everyone will like. <br /> <br />Kostova's debut novel begins in Amsterdam in 1972, and picks up the narrative of a sixteen-year-old girl who lives in the city with her father.  While alone in their home one day, she comes across a strange book on one of the shelves in her father's library: Bound in ancient leather, the book is empty except for a mysterious woodcut of a dragon across the center pages, accompanied by one chilling word: DRAKULYA.  With the book, she finds a packet of letters, all addressed to \\"My dear and unfortunate successor.\\" When she confronts her father, Paul reluctantly begins telling her an unsettling tale: Twenty years earlier, Paul's college mentor, Bartholomew Rossi, disappears from his office after telling Paul about his research involving Vlad Tepes--\\"The Impaler\\"--the cruel ruler of Wallachia in the fifteenth century and the real-life Dracula.  This research, he tells Paul before his disappearance, led him to believe that Dracula is still alive.  After Rossi's disappearance, Paul and a young Romanian scholar with secrets of her own become involved in a frantic search to find the missing historian--and maybe the mythical vampire himself--before it's too late.  After telling his daughter all of this twenty years later, Paul himself disappears. <br /> <br />Kostova's narrative is three-fold.  We are treated to the daughter's narrative as she conducts her own secret research into the ancient legend of Dracula and searches for her missing father in 1972.  The other two sections of the narrative are told in an epistolary fashion: Paul's letters to his daughter, narrating his adventures while searching for Rossi in 1952; and the letters of Rossi himself, written to his \\"successor\\" as he conducts his own research in 1930.  This, in addition to numerous settings to keep straight and dense research, all adds up to an ambitious first novel for Kostova. <br /> <br />But perhaps a bit too ambitious?  Maybe I should start with what Kostova does well in THE HISTORIAN.  The first three hundred pages are good: heart-stoppingly good.  I found myself staying up late many nights to read \\"just one more chapter,\\" despite the fact that, in many instances, I was scared out of my wits to read on.  Part One of the novel is intense, pulse-pounding, fast-paced, intellectually thrilling--everything you would expect a novel about Dracula to be, especially if you've read Bram Stoker's version.  Kostova's descriptions of Europe, its famous landmarks and its topography, are beautifully written.  The epistolary style of narrative is engaging, although I do have my doubts about the remarkable depth, incredible length, and specific dialogue of the letters; they're not very realistic, as far as letters go. <br /> <br />It's in Parts Two and Three of the novel that Kostova's narrative descends into the purely intellectual and away from the thrilling.  While I wouldn't agree with the sentiment that reading her novel is like reading a travelogue of Eastern Europe, the historical detail does become overwhelming at points.  I certainly caught myself rereading the same paragraph three or four times in more than one case, wondering what bearing an extensive description of Istanbul's Topkapi Palace had on the outcome of the story.  Additionally, I found the lengthy fictional article contained in the pages, \\"The 'Chronicle' of Zacharias of Zographou,\\" to be unnecessary. But this, too, was bearable for me: I love history and was fascinated by many of Kostova's sensitive details; for instance, did you know that Bulgarians nod their heads to say 'no' and shake them to say 'yes'?  But if you know everything there is to know about Eastern Europe, or you don't give a wit about Eastern Europe, THE HISTORIAN probably isn't the book for you.  <br /> <br />So while I can accept the fact that Kostova felt it necessary to include what I can only imagine are passages lifted directly from her dissertation, and to include them in an often dry, textbook-like style, I can't accept the ending of her lengthy novel.  THE HISTORIAN took me a good week and a half to read--and I can't remember the last time I worked on one book for that long--but I stuck with it because I was expecting a blow-out ending; I mean, there *had* to be a confrontation with Dracula, right?  And in that regard, I wasn't disappointed; Kostova's Dracula is an appealing figure, fittingly articulate and polite and also purely evil.  But my question is this: How can a being who has existed for more than five hundred years be done away with by mere mortals so easily?  IN ONE PARAGRAPH?  She takes six hundred pages to get to her climax, and then it happens in ONE PARAGRAPH?  Clearly, she was ready to be done writing--and at that point, I was ready to be done reading. <br /> <br />THE 'DRACULA' CODE this is not, but THE HISTORIAN is still a captivating book in its own right, despite numerous freshman flaws (length, lack of a satisfying climax, etc. etc.).  For lovers of historical fiction, for lovers of a good Dracula novel, THE HISTORIAN will be entertaining and engaging enough to get through.  But know this going in: It's long, so you'll have to devote a lot of time to it.  And it's not \\"fluffy\\" long, either: You have to pay attention to what's going on.  Much of it is boring.  The ending is ultimately unsatisfying.  But the characters are engaging, the epistolary narrative is refreshing, many passages are haunting; the novel does have good elements.  Elizabeth Kostova is destined for greatness, but THE HISTORIAN was just a little bit too ambitious of an undertaking.	2005-10-09

I was a big fan of the original Premonitions novel, and had originally figured that Jordan Cray would have a difficult time topping herself.  Sequels that outstrip their successors are so rare and hard to come by, it's such a refreshing breath of fresh air to find a novel that meets and exceeds all the expectations held by fans of the original, while at the same time maintaining the overall tone and feel of the original.  Gracie is still the quiet but intelligent leading gal that she was the first time around, and her visions are still going to get her in trouble.  Like all good sequels though, Disappearance raises the stakes, and Gracie's father reappears after thirteen years of absence around the same time as a dead body is uncovered in the water and Gracie's island home is turned upside down.  With the help of her computer hacker friend Ryan, (man, he sure seems like a cool guy, and he's so nice too!) Gracie's visions make her the only person who has a chance to simultaneously get to the bottom of both mysteries.  Disappearance was a wonderful, unpredictable thrill ride all the way through, full of brilliant twists and turns and equally brilliant and well-drawn characters.  The two main story arcs of the book - Gracie and her father, and Gracie and the murder - intertwine slowly but ingeniously, and where they take the reader, you won't know until the very last minute.   <br /> <br />A terrific read, and a book that I would strongly reccomend to everyone.	2005-10-09

I found it more interesting from an abstract, symbolic, 'flashback to those thought provoking discussions in freshman-lit' kind of way. There was the modern day Romeo and Juliet angle, the commentary on today's political world, the parallels that I assume the author was trying to draw between Blake and Melissa's dad (i.e., what made one act admirable and the other criminal). <br /> <br />As with many books of that nature, however, I didn't connect with it on a more basic level. The characters didn't seem real to me - as someone already mentioned...Melissa gets a 1450 on her SATs and we're supposed to believe she is THAT clueless?. Dick and Rosemary and walking stereotypes and Blake himself remains an elusive character. It would have been nice to see some kind of character development, maybe Melissa discovering that her parents aren't as one dimensional as she thinks, but it never happens. <br /> <br />A good book for a long philosophical discussion in a book club or English class, overall.	2005-10-09

I have devoted 15 years to researching and writing about the Biblical roots and influences in early A.A.'s Christian Fellowship. And no one can fully grasp the story of early A.A., its cures, and its principles and practices without understanding the importance that the pioneers attached to the sermon on the mount (Matthew 5 to 7). Sadly, a number of AAs have settled for the belief that Emmet Fox's Sermon on the Mount was the cornerstone of A.A.'s sermon emphasis. No so! The fact is that both A.A. co-founders Dr. Bob and Bill W. stated that the sermon itself contained the underlying philosophy of A.A. And my title The James Club: The Original A.A. Program's Absolute Essentials ([...]) contains a verse by verse study of the three parts of the Bible AAs considered essential--the sermon, the book of James, and 1 Corinthians 13. Hence it is with the Bible itself that A.A. students of spirituality should start. Next, however, they need to know how broad was the supplementary reading. And that is where Oswald Chambers comes in. Dr. Bob and his wife stressed the importance of the sermon, and they read it in their groups and in the early meetings. But Dr. Bob also accumulated, read, studied, and circulated the background sermon books. And I found these among his library (that came into the hands of his son and daughter). I encountered Oswald Chambers's Studies in the Sermon on the Mount, E. Stanley Jones's The Christ of the Mount, Emmet Fox's The Sermon on the Mount, several books by Robert E. Speer that covered parts of the subject, a number of books by Rev. Sam Shoemaker to the same end, several titles by Harry Emerson Fosdick such as The Manhood of the Master, and a number of books by Glenn Clark. And all of these presented a broad field of interpretive writings on Jesus's sermon that enhanced the early pioneers' understanding. And if one takes Chambers's title and sets it alongside Jones's title, he will see that these two writers were, in effect, contending that the gift of the holy spirit without the sermon on the mount in practice was as inadequate as the sermon on the mount in practice without the power of the holy spirit. <br /> <br />I have written two titles, Dr. Bob and His Library, and The Books Early AAs Read for Spiritual Growth. Both include Chambers and his studies as favorites. And people who want to get the full depth of the early A.A. Christian believing will profit immensely by looking at this Chambers book. <br /> <br />As an aside, when I contacted Mrs. W. Irving Harris, widow of Rev. Sam Shoemaker's assistant minister, she provided me with a complete set of the Oswald Chambers books indicating these were part of Sam's favorite books. The set has now been donated to the Griffith Library in East Dorset, Vermont; and one can gain a good understanding of the importance of Chambers to the thinking of the New York A.A. ideas taught by Rev. Sam Shoemaker to Bill Wilson and to the Akron fellowship's focus as led by Dr. Bob. <br />God Bless, Richard G. Burns, J.D. <br />Incidentally, it would appear that Amazon has erroneously listed my colleague Terry Dunford as the writer of this review, but it is I who makes the review and recommendations.	2005-10-09

The action ranges from China to Washington, D.C. to the Olympic rain forest and points in between, and the story is told in several voices which are as distinct and characteristic as they are engaging.  The characterization is strong, the pace is brisk without being rushed, the surprises are neither telegraphed or short-changed, and the whole thing is an absolute hoot from start to finish (in the sense of being great fun).  Penz resists the temptation to tie everything up in too tidy a bundle at the end of the novel, so that the intrigue lives on when the last page is turned -- in other words, it delivers (grin).

It seemed that some of the reviewers took offence at the content and therefore gave it low ratings.  There was an extensive review by the F.A.R.M.S. group (Mormon apologetics supported and paid by Mormon institutions).  In the review it was very easy to see that the apologetics were afraid of the book, because rather than give evidence of the failings or shortcomings of the book, they attacked the books author with what appeared to be a thinly veiled character attack.  The other ratings presented were generally were very high.  This made the book more interesting to me as a Mormon. <br /> <br />I found the book a refreshing change from the books that are recommended by the Mormon Church.  The author presented primary source documentation to support almost every topic presented.  There were some sections where the author made certain suppositions and conjectures.  These were clearly identified as such. <br /> <br />In all, I felt the work was presented well, easy to read and factual.  It is a pity that the Mormon Church is so afraid of its members finding out about the \\"true\\" history of the roots of Mormonism.  It is disturbing to me that the Mormon Church felt the need to disfellowship the author for writing the truth. <br />	2005-10-09

Norberg's references have been updated by the translators; Jan Ziolkowski's expert introduction surveys more recent work that has supplemented but not supplanted the original study, which remains essential for all students and readers of medieval Latin poetry.	2005-10-09

I have to disagree. I think if you liked her other books, you'll like this one. <br /> <br />It's true that this book lacks a fun conceit like small-breastedness. Here, the heroine has wide feet and difficulty finding stylish shoes that fit, which is somehow just not as catchy. But the plot and characters make up for this. Rosie, our heroine, is much more capable than the heroine of 32AA and Call Waiting. Rosie is the successful co-owner of a business, Odd Jobs, and she also takes good care of her mother. <br /> <br />The only area where Rosie is not thriving is her love life. However, instead of being incurably single like many chick lit heroines, she has an overabundance of men in her life. At one point in the story, she finds herself at a table where she has slept with every man but one!  <br /> <br />The central man in the story is Luke, or Dr. Love, an obstetrician who catches Rosie's eye at a dull work do. After a romantic night together, Rosie finds out that Dr. Love is married, and she tries to avoid him, though she runs into him and his wife everywhere. Then Rosie's competitive cousin, Elaine, starts to pursue Dr. Love. <br /> <br />Elaine is a masterpiece. She's one of those people who orchestrates situations so that everyone else will feel maximum embarrassment and humiliation. We all know someone like this and Michelle Cunnah brings Elaine to life. <br /> <br />It's somewhat predictable whom Rosie will end up with, but there are so many entertaining twists and turns along the way that I didn't really mind.	2005-10-09

The story opens with one of the villagers traveling to a neighboring town to search for a woman he has dreamed of but never met, but whom he believes he is fated to marry.  When he fails to find her, he returns to the village, buying a pregnant rabbit along the way as a sort of consolation prize.  The rabbit is carrying the plague, which proceeds to swiftly ravage the town. <br /> <br />The rest of the novel tells the story of what happens to the few survivors when the plague has passed, what they do to cope in this new world they find themselves in.  Without a priest, they don't know how to conduct the proper funeral ceremonies for those who have died.  At first, they do their best at imitating the priest's incantations, mumbling incoherently over the graves and waving their arms about, but as the number of dead increases exponentially, they eventually give up all pretense of ritual and bury them as quickly and simply as possible. <br /> <br />Left to their own devices, not only without a priest, but with no government, no elder statesmen  to guide them, they feel they have no way of knowing how things should be done.  The knowledge of what's right and proper has vanished with those who died; and anyway, there must have been something wrong with the old ways if they could not prevent the plague from wiping out the village.  So the men of the village take it upon themselves to reinvent the ethical codes and daily habits that they are to live by.  They seem mostly motivated by a desire to do what's best, or at least whatever works, but their motives are not untinged by the usual components of greed, avarice, and lust, and even when they seek to do good they are at best flailing about blindly without a moral guidepost in sight. <br /> <br />The story is told in a very simple, straightforward style, and it has elements of both history and fable.  There is a great deal of humor here, and there is some goodness to be found in every character, but on the whole this is, despite the title, a dark novel that is not afraid to examine the worst side of human nature.  It is easy to imagine that in a similar situation, people today would not act much differently from the people in this novel - and the recent events in New Orleans make this feel even closer to home.   <br /> <br />This is truly a brilliant novel.  The characters, though simply drawn, are utterly believable, and the story unfolds swiftly and compellingly.  It is boldly honest and clear in its look at the motives and consequences of human actions.  The ending comes full circle in an elegant way, revealing something surprising about the search for love that began the novel, and suggesting that life can and will go on despite catastrophes of both the body and the soul, but at the same time hinting that the basis of the ethical framework upon which we depend is both tenuous and arbitrary, though in the end we can't do without it.	2005-10-09

This book, first published in 1940, was adapted to film in 1948, which film starred Joseph Cotton and Jennifer Jones. I was sufficiently intrigued by the film, so as to want to read the book upon which the film was based but was surprised to discover, however,  that the book is more of a novella, as it runs a scant one hundred and twenty-five pages in length. While not lengthy, it is, nonetheless, a haunting story, although it differs is some respects from the film.<br /><br />The book tells the story of a young, struggling artist in New York named Eben Adams, who is really little more than a hack. One winter night in 1938, a down and out Eben is in Central Park, having been  unsuccessful in selling his paintings. There, he encounters a very young girl named Jennie Appleton, who is mysteriously in the park by herself, playing hopscotch. Thus, begins Eben's acquaintance with Jennie.<br /><br />Eben sketches a picture of Jennie, which to his surprise, he is able to sell. Periodically, Jennie begins appearing in his life at odd times, always swathed in mystery as to her origins and always appearing somehow older than expected each time he sees her.  Eben continues to sketch her, finding that he can sell those sketches with ease. Inspired by his muse, he paints her portrait, a masterpiece that eventually lands in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<br /><br />He is puzzled, nonetheless, by the anomaly and mystery that surrounds Jennie, who has an air of being from another time.  Yet,  an unusual bond is developing between them, one that not even the vagaries of time can break. It is also one that becomes increasingly romantic over time, as Jennie quickly grows into womanhood. The fates, however, Eben finds, can be cruel.<br /><br />Those who enjoy romantic stories with supernatural portents will very much enjoy this haunting tale of two star crossed individuals.	2005-10-09

This book hits on so many levels, it's difficult to know where to start.  Abel Jones as the frugal Welsh Methodist kills me with his wry one-liners on society, then throws in a profound insight on the nature of Christianity.  He goes from comedian to theologian in the space of a paragraph.   <br />The characters are very convincingly presented - I highly recommend the audio version, in which the narrator does a masterful job with pacing and accents.  For the last week, I've rushed out of work, eager to start my drive home so I can hear what kind of trouble Abel Jones is going to get himself into and out of next.  <br />If there are weaknesses in the book, they're in the casualness of the violence and in the twisted nature of the political and intelligence games being played.  So many people die in so many bizarre ways that's it's difficult to keep track of who is killing whom; also, the complex intrigues that populate the book tiptoe right to the edge of incredulity.  Still, Abel Jones' making sense of it all in his sober Welsh way is a great literary device.  Another thing I really like about the book is that it is self-contained.  I haven't read any of the three \\"Abel Jones\\" books that precede this one, but I don't feel lost in this one because I haven't read the others.  There are allusions to characters that I assume come from the preceding books, but my unacquaintance with these characters didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book.  <br />I had no idea before I got into this book and started trying to find out about the author on the Internet that Owen Parry is a pseudonym for Ralph Peters, but it's interesting to me that someone I consider one of the best thinkers on modern strategy is also such a capable novelist.  I can't wait to tackle the other books in the series.	2005-10-09

I have always found that works on Chess are most accurate (if not always most readable) when written by the player, eliminating the need for second degree sources and speculation. Despite the fact that he never made it to the title of World Champion, Larsen is possibly one of the most prominent figures of 20th century chess, with a career spanning five decades, falling on either side of his contention for the title in the 1960s.  <br />His book runs straight from the early years in Denmark through to the glory years, and is a suitable commentary on the experiences of one of the most innovative of players. It is a good read in general, and a necessity I think for anyone whose interest lies in 20th century chess.	2005-10-09

Camille has been hired to renovate the aging estate of an ailing and genteel gentleman, who wants to leave something welcoming and homey for future generations.  When she arrives at the mansion, she realizes that Zack, a man with whom she shared a vacation romance and night of passion 2 years earlier, is the heir.  Neither she nor Zack have been able to forget the other and move on in their respective love lives, but they need to resolve some misunderstandings before they can pick up where they left off.  The bickering and unnecessary nastiness in trying to put distance between themselves and the other turned me off a bit because I felt their reasoning for pushing the other away wasn't very believable and could have been handled more respectfully and more easily with better communication.  Yet, I still enjoyed the story because it was very cute and romantic.  Camille, Zack and all the secondary characters were very likable, especially in their compassion towards the ailing Rayburn.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that this was Sandra Brown's very first novel.

US	51694812	R1FJZAS2PYGQNY	0525942416	786571932	Survivor	Books	5	15	16	N	N	Fearfully and wonderfully made	Fiction about the results of postmodern family fragmentation usually focuses on the failures, not the survivors, perhaps because the failures may come across as sympathetic-while the survivors probably don't.  What survivors may win from their chaotic experiences is a brittle, uneven, unkind strength.  Tabitha King's young protagonist, Kristin \\"Kissy\\" Mellors, brings that kind of strength out of the chaos of her youth.  We learn that Kissy was raised by feckless, undependable/uncaring parents and enjoyed no stability until she landed at Sowerwine University.  Her college is really her first home.  <br /> <br />At twenty-one or so, Kissy is a talented photographer with some issues. She doesn't like men, but she does like sleeping with them; unfortunately, she isn't very good at actually avoiding bad men, and she's not all that consistent with contraception, which has made for some trouble in her life and will make for some more. She seems to live with the constant low terror that a sensitive young person would feel, lacking all real backup and knowing that one false move may undo everything she's put together for herself, but not sure what kind of move is a false one. In the midst of senior-year stress and the aftermath of witnessing a tragic car accident, Kissy meets rising hockey star Junior Clootie.  The need for intimacy and connection is what Kissy and Junior share.  In a reversal of the usual sexual scenario, he's the one who admits his need. Sexual harmony (and hot sex scenes) follow.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, a serious mistake by Junior forever undermines Kissy's shaky faith in him, after which follow a breakup, a reunion, a contraceptive failure, a marriage...and then things really go downhill.  In excruciating psychologically accurate detail, the reader gets to see Kissy grind Junior slowly and painfully to little bits.  Furthermore, while so doing, Kissy also grinds herself slowly and painfully to little bits.  Junior is no more immature than most men of twenty or twenty-one and kinder, more patient, and more perceptive than the rank and file of humanity; he's an innocent in the wrong place at the wrong time, namely in the path of Kissy's destructive rage. The cycle is continued in the storm-torn, tossed-from-pillar-to-post childhood of their daughter Dynah.   <br /> <br />Tabitha King achieves the same feat that Tanith Lee managed with Rachaela, the protagonist of her Blood Opera series: creating an unsympathetic character who manages to command readers' interest and...well...sympathy.  Kissy, who seems to benefit from Junior's generous support even after divorcing him, is mean and venial and chronically unable to cut any other human a millimeter of slack, and yet it is no stretch to pity her at the book's desolate ending.  <br /> <br />Every instant of this character's experience is rendered with believability that leaves a reader thinking: \\"Yes, people act like that. Yes, they suffer like that. Yes, they're usually unable to stop doing the things that make them suffer like that. This happens all the time, everywhere.\\"    <br /> <br />I love Stephen King's books, buy every one of them as soon as it comes out, and read it until I either finish it or have a headache, in which case I finish it the next night. But Tabitha King is a better novelist than her man Stephen.  He writes about the symbolic language into which we translate our fears.  The devices of the horror genre are more-malleable, more-endurable ways to think about loss, dead ends, failure, humiliation, helplessness, hunger, and other true vectors of human pain.  Tabitha King writes directly about what we have to fear.	2005-10-09

It also brought up the happy hedonism of youth, as opposed to how depressing it all gets when you keep trying to stay hip when you are way too old to pull it off. I guess what seems fun when you are in your 20s begins to seem sort of sordid when you are in your 30s.  This book captures those themes, while also revealing the price you will ultimately pay if the good times go on too long. <br /> <br />Greenfield (he also wrote a good book about Japnese youth,  Speed Tribes) writes vividly about Asia , so vividly that you sometimes wonder how he could have seen all the stuff he claims to have seen and done all the stuff he supposedly has done. This is one of the problems of a book like this, a memoir, where we are supposed to either believe everything the author says or take it all with a knowing wink from the author. In this case, the book is just ribald, bawdy and sexy enough to pull it off, but just barely. Still, I have never read a travel book quite like this, especially one that gets into some of the specifics of travel writing, like how one gets assignments from magazines and writing for airplane magazines and all that.  <br /> <br />Worthwhile, and for those of us who raved in Thailand or Goa, a fun trip down memory lane.	2005-10-09

Having been closely involved with the ongoing situation in Haiti the book reads like it was written today, looking back at history, rather than having been written over a year ago. Everything he predicted has - unfortunately - come true.  <br /> <br />It also reveals the truths involved with Aristide's theft of Haiti's elections of 2000. On March 5, 2000 Aristide and his inner circle sacrificed a newborn baby in an effort to guarantee his win in November of that year. Exposed is Aristide control of the cocaine traffic into America and his theft of $1.5 billions from the state treasury. He is now being supported by the American government in luxurious South African exile. <br /> <br />Aristide's hate for America was shown when he, and his associates, toasted bin Laden after 9/11 and Aristide would not allow his government to send condolences to Washington. <br /> <br />The two books should be required reading for the entire United Nations fiasco that has been inflicted on Haiti. No one has learned from the past and will continue to destroy the future unless the rules of the game are changed. Once again the American government has meddled in the situation in an attempt to inflict their own concept of democracy, rather that let the Haitians chose their own government. A recent Gallop Poll in Haiti showed  62 percent of those canvassed stating the jean-Claude Duvalier presidency was the best in the last 20 years. Aristide's governments were not even mentioned. <br /> <br />ARISTIDE- The Death of a Nation reveals and analyses errors of the past and warns of errors in the future. The past 18 months have seen dozens of Garrison's predictions come true. Haiti is rapidly sliding into the abyss, exactly as predicted within the chapters of this book. <br />	2005-10-09

The whole book could have been condensed to 20 pages without any loss of information.   <br /> <br />The book does cover, at a high-level, what an IDE is and why Ant was created.  There is a whole chapter on \\"Ant Core Functionality\\" that basically lists different Ant commands but gives absolutely no context on how to use them.  It is not until page 207 does the book actually mention that Ant uses a build script (build.xml).  On page 236 you build your first and only build script and it is very, very basic.  Then you are finished with the book. <br /> <br />I knew next-to-nothing about Ant before reading the book and I know next-to-nothing now. Please believe us \\"1-star\\" reviewers; this book is not worth buying. <br />	2005-10-09

I never thought I'd find myself sympathizing with the Japanese, yet they were so overwhelmed, and their losses so staggering and complete that I couldn't help wondering if the war could have been shortened if we only relaxed our insistance on unconditional surrender. The Japanese viewed their Emperor as a god and their great fear was that we would terminate his reign once they were defeated. This they could never accept and, as it turned out, he was allowed to maintain his position in Japanese society.<br /><br />  There are many fascinating anecdotes in this story. One in particular I'll mention: when the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki a Japanese pilot was in the vicinity and, out of curiosity, he proceded to fly his small plane into the mushroom cloud. That's probably the closest anyone has ever come to experiencing what it must be like to be enveloped by the sun's atmosphere!<br /><br />  I could go on and on. If you enjoy military history and would like to gain some insights into the Japanese culture during that time then you will love this book. I give it two thumbs up, way up.	2005-10-09

I not only recommend this book, I have bought it-- TWICE! <br /> <br />I owned an earlier version of this book and used the recipes in it as the basis for my parties while in the Navy.  I have a few of my mother's recipes but this book is the basis for all of my friends thinking that I am an outstanding cook.  Instead, I was a thirty-something bachelor who can read and follow directions.  This book is that good. <br /> <br />The recipes are absolutely delicious and after Hurricane Katrina hit I ordered a new copy of this- PRONTO!  <br /> <br />My only complaint about the book is that occasionally the recipes assume you know the basics.  Maybe most people know that you have to soak dried beans before cooking them but I didn't and so my first attempt at Red Beans and Rice was a disaster.  But most of you aren't going to be such amateurs in the kitchen as I was when I did that.  I look forward to reading the latest version just to see if those oversights were eliminated. <br /> <br />Aside from that, I wholeheartedly recommend this book.  I read the reviewer who said he had a separate copy in a safe deposit box.  Good Idea!	2005-10-09

Now, I again find myself drawn to an author of similar fascination.<br /><br />After Hurricane's Katrina and Rita, with all the malls closed in New Orleans, Barnes and Nobles closed, Amazon wouldn't ship to me as I was in the impacted area, and no resource available to buy books, I drove to Baton Rouge.  There, while wandering the aisles with my arms piled high with over a hundred dollars worth of books, determined not to be caught without books to read again, I happened to see Paolini's books \\"Eragon\\" and \\"Eldest\\" highlighted on a shelf.  I bought them both.<br /><br />I must admit that \\"Eragon\\" immediately brought me under it's spell.  While occasionally you are pulled out of the story when you find a name or setting similar to Tolkein's trilogy it has an addicting spirit all it's own.<br /><br />Paolini's characters are strong and speak with individual voices.  The setting is crisply described and easy to imagine.  Even with LSU playing on the TV in the background his book draws me away from the game with eager anticipation.  I look forward to reading Eldest.<br /><br />Enjoy...	2005-10-09

I wish now that I hadn't.  Although I did find a few ideas in the book about taking risks interesting, hence two stars instead of one, overall it was pretty bad.  At one point I almost stopped reading, but felt compelled to finsih in the hopes that it got better. <br /> <br />A lot of the ideas presented are laughable.  For example, ignore the advice of experts (which the author presumably qualifies as) or do the opposite.  So basically, you should do nothing the author himself suggests.   <br /> <br />I did find the authors advice on keeping fit and healthy interesting, but at the same time takes it too far into the land of junk science.

The basic premise behind Mine Yoshizaki's SGT FROG manga is this: froglike alien Sgt. Keroro and his extraterrestrial compatriots, in a failed attempt to conquer Pokopen (the Earth), find themselves stranded in the company of two Pokopenian siblings, Fuyuki and Natsumi Hinata, and their friends and family. Hilarity ensues. There you go. That's the series - beyond that there is no real coherent plot. But that's not particularly important, because the fact is a complex storyline isn't required for madcap comedy of this order.  <br /> <br />The best comparison you can draw to Sgt. Frog is probably to Pinky & the Brain: overloaded with pop culture (Japanese anyway) allusions and socio-political send-ups, our protagonist conjures up preposterous scheme after preposterous scheme, to no avail. Another easy comparison would be with Invader Zim. The biggest difference between Sgt. Frog and these others, however, is the ensemble size: while P&B revolved around the clashing personalities of the title characters, and Invader Zim a team of four or so, Sgt. Frog is propelled by a stable cast of about a dozen unique, distinctly off-the-wall personalities.  <br /> <br />There's Natsumi Hinata, for instance, the Pokopenian teen whose authoritative hot-headedness remains the biggest obstacle on the path to invasion - apart from Sgt. Keroro himself, equal parts inept interstellar conqueror and freeloading plastic Gundam model fanatic. Then there's Natsumi's younger brother Fuyuki, a quiet, introverted kid with a keen interest in the occultm or Momoka Nishizawa, the insecure heiress to a worldwide fortune with a keen interest in Fuyuki. Not to mention Private Tamama, one of the Sgt.'s fellow-invaders, whose adorable exterior belies a violent split personality; the ditzy Lady Angol Moa, sent to Earth by her father the universal Lord of Terror to destroy it, but diverted by Keroro's misadventures; and many more.  <br /> <br />The various plots, goofy and overblown as they are, make fulluse of the characters' interpersonal chemistry. For instance: when the School Sports Festival rolls around, athletic Natsumi petitions mom Aki to join her in the child-parent activities. But Aki is unable to attend due to her demanding career as a manga editor, which causes her to be gone most of the time anyway. Natsumi is forlorn by yet another absence, and while Keroro schemes to stand in for Mom Hinata in an attempt to put Natsumi in his debt, Corporal Giroro, whose hard-boiled shell hides a monstrous affection for the girl, has other plans. Meanwhile, Fuyuki suffers from a lack of self-confidence living in his sister's athletic shadow, and wealthy Momoka's attempts to aid his cause at the Festival, like having her bodyguards tranquilize the other racers, are sweet but probably misguided. That's just a sampling, from one of the tamer chapters at that - the insanity quotient is generally far more in excess.  <br /> <br />Many of the installments have sensitive undercurrents: unrequited love, the clash between friendship and duty, jealousy, emotional insecurity, family dynamics, and so on. But there's something of overanalyzing in that evaluation, because any pyschological underpinnings involved are offset by copious coatings of over-the-top illustration, harebrained scenarios, laugh-out-loud hilarious gags, and unforgettably zany characters. Be forewarned: in spite of Keroro and Company's admitted adorability it's not for kiddies - there's enough sexual suggestion here to border on ecchi at times. But it's all in fun, and if you have a well developed sense of the absurd, as I like to put it, Sgt. Frog is as good n' silly as it gets.	2005-10-09

Cybelle Carter, a star on the show, comes to Morgan and expresses concern because she's going to be on the cover of Time.  She is married to Philippe Abacasas.  He has threatened to kill her if he finds her.   <br /> <br />Morgan gets a call that a body has been found in Cybelle's apartment.  She immediately thinks it is Cybelle.  It turns out to be her stunt double.   Morgan is concerned that Cybelle was the intended victim.   <br /> <br />Morgan meets Abacasas.  He tells a completely different story in which Cybelle and her brother stole some coins from him.  Abacasas is an attractively handsome man.  Who should Morgan believe?  She wants to get to the truth. <br /> <br />Morgan's sometimes boyfriend, a police detective, is not happy with her looking into another murder.  She still has to create and produce episodes in the daytime drama as well as find time to do her sleuthing.  Can she figure out who's telling the truth and who killed the stunt double without becoming a victim herself? <br /> <br />I love this series.  Ms. Palmer has a real hit on her hands!  Morgan is such a fun character.  She is very down to earth, but yet she is willing to step out when needed. <br /> <br />The relationship tension and the work demands all add to this series.  Everything is well scripted and blended.  I highly recommend this book and series. <br />	2005-10-09

It is about A4 size, 96pp long and with softcovers <br /> <br />It is a really punchy and concise book about the Maori history of New zealand. It includes lots of early pictures and maps of Auckland with the sites put it. I really enjoyed this book because it talked of things which had long gone with European settlement and the suburbs - small lakes, rivers and even mountains removed or leveled to make way for houses, streets and growth. <br /> <br />This also has a small but good prehistory of the region (pre-European) including the conflicts, the tribes, the legends etc <br /> <br />It has some wonderful additional stuff, the nights of the moon which was the Maori calendar (the days were described by the moon. there is also a Maori place-name glossary in the back for auckland names and include a brief description and sometimes possible reasons for it - whether pre-european or not. <br /> <br />There are several turn of the century pictures around Auckland. which show how isolated Auckland was then, now a city of over 1 million people. <br /> <br />My main problem with this is two fold. Firstly I think the maps need to have the current Auckland names on them. Using the Maori names is really great, but it makes it difficult to relate it to what is there now without better references in it. Secondly I think the whole of the Gulf should have been included. There is some brief reference to it such as Rangitot and briefly Browns Island, but I don't understand why Waiheke is not included. Maori were very mobile with canoes and trading, and the island is a short hop from Maraetai - if not Auckland itself. <br /> <br />Otherwise I think this is a great book and we will be recommending it to any visitors to Auckland. I think it is one of the best reads, and easy to follow. It is really enjoyable and has an air of authority about it as well.	2005-10-09

What an incredible accomplishment.  McAuliffe should find deep satisfaction in what he has done, for it's a worthy effort.<br /><br />\\"Purple Sun\\" takes some of the author's knowledge of the Vietnam War and assimilates it into a fictional tale of a guilt-ridden soldier who disappears after being sent back into action.  Has Billy Kern finally met his end?  Has he gone AWOL?  Or, as later accounts suggest, has he sought a spiritual atonement for the things he has seen and done?<br /><br />The book tackles the questions of war and loyalty, heroism and bravery.  The cover calls it an epic.  In all honesty, I would not qualify this as epic literature, either in scale or language.  The dialogue is well done, the characters are memorable, and the narrative has moments of beauty and grace.  But there are a number of problems.  The author jumps around from one person's thoughts to the next--a violation of point-of-view, which is addressed in nearly every book on the craft of writing fiction.  Also, the scenes are broken into past and present in a convoluted manner which detracts from the story's power.  With a few changes, or with the prudent eye of an editor, I believe \\"Purple Sun\\" could've accomplished as much, if not more, by shifting some sequences and by deleting some of the redundant dialogues midway through.  We know that Isaiah wants to put ghosts to rest and that Gallo wants to pursue them.<br /><br />McAuliffe shows a true understanding of human nature, and I appreciated his dealing with serious issues that surely impacted him profoundly in his own experience.  In the end, a worthy goal for any novelist is to wrestle with his own questions and present them in an honest fashion while presenting readers with a satisfying story.  In this, the author succeeds.  I thank him for the opportunity to read his work.	2005-10-09

We're catching up on Chandler's private-eye Philip Marlowe novels published in the 1940's, having read \\"Poodle Springs\\" (his last work, actually finished by Robert Parker) and \\"The Big Sleep\\", his first and perhaps most well-known entry in the set, possibly due to the movie with Humphrey Bogart.  The book is classic Chandler: beautifully descriptive prose almost wasted on the seedy characters that populate the storyline.  The plot kicks off with a wealthy but crotchety old woman hiring Marlowe to recover a valuable gold coin she is sure was stolen by her now missing daughter-in-law.  As Marlowe learns more about the matter, a young guy starts tailing him, then admits to being a fellow private dick who might need Marlowe's help with a case.  Soon that guy turns up dead; in fact, throughout the tale Marlowe has a nasty habit of finding dead bodies, which only serves to exasperate the police, whom our leading man tends to frustrate by refusing to part with what he knows about whom.<br /><br />In the end, of course Marlowe figures it all out, but not before some surprises bend the plot this way and that.  [We won't spoil what the novel's title implies...]  One would not suspect this novel is some 60 years old; that it so readily entertains is certain testimony to its withstanding the aging process.  Chandler's fine writing skills, bordering on literature, as usual tend to create a screenplay in our heads for us, which adds to the enjoyment.  Despite all the drinking, smoking, and \\"easy\\" women at hand, this easy read is another fine mystery by this famous author of nearly a century ago.	2005-10-09

I lost a lot of sleep reading into the wee hours of the morning because I couldn't bear to part with it until the following evening. The story offers a really intelligent viewpoint on the challenges that time travel could pose, particularly to someone who has no control over their destination in time or place. Told from the alternating viewpoints of both the time traveler and his wife, it's a story of love and survival. It is not a sappy love story or romance novel, but love is definitely at the core of this story.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn, upon finishing the book, that this was the author's first novel. This book is very well written and thought out, and the flow and pacing of the novel are nearly perfect. In spite of the gaps of knowledge that time travel would naturally provide, the story itself has no gaps. This book has already become one of my top two favorite books, and I look forward to reading more by Ms. Niffenegger.	2005-10-09

I would like to invite him, along with all the other Anti-Americans (Alec Baldwin said he wouldn't live here if Bush was re-elected, but I didn't see him loading up the van after the election, typical Hollywood BS) to leave the country and never come back. Please.  <br /> <br />This is a great country, and I am deeply saddened every time I hear these extremists ignorantly denouncing the very country that has given them the right to speak freely, assemble freely, choose their religions, choose their way of life. They are, as Sean Hannity puts it, the \\"appeasers.\\" They spend all their energy blaming America for all the world's problems, yet what are they doing to help solve the problems? Do they think spreading hatred is the answer? It seems to me that guys like Moore, along with so-called leaders like Jackson and Farakkhan, just like to keep the pot boiling, but never offer any real solutions. If the social problems they seemed so concerned with were solved (or at least headed in the right direction), they would lose their power and the cashflow, and we couldn't have that happen now, could we?? A suggestion to all the badmouthers and troublemakers listed in the book - try spending your energy helping to find solutions instead of causing more problems. Maybe then you'll get the respect you seem to so desperately crave (and help our oh-so-terrible country get better in the process).  <br />	2005-10-09

Bruschi is not in uniform this season, having suffered a mild stroke after the Patriots won their third Super Bowl in four years.  The irony that neither player is playing for these teams this year is not what makes the cover appropriate, but that these are the two northern most teams in the division.  The only thing that would make the picture more appropriate would be if Bruschi was tackling Henry in the snow up in Buffalo with each team wearing red, white and blue.  The New York Jets know what it is like to play in the snow, but the Miami Dolphins have to wonder what they are doing in this cold weather division.  In this introduction to the four teams of the AFC East, Bob Woods helps to explain why the Dolphins belong but the Baltimore Ravens do not (although the explanation may well be less than satisfactory).<br /><br />The story of the AFC East begins more with the AFL than the NFL, since three of the teams were original members of the AFL (guess which one was not).  Woods overviews the division as providing some memorable first in pro football history: the Jets were the first AFL team to win the Super Bowl, the Patriots were the first team to win the Super Bowl on the final play, and the Bills had the first 2,000 yard rusher.  The Dolphins?  They are the first and only team to have a \\"perfect\\" record.  This sense of history is what important in these books, because the assumption is that young fans know about Tom Brady and Chad Pennington, but they might not know the legacies of Joe Namath, Bob Griese, and Jack Kemp.  The team histories are also more important because Travis Henry is not the only \\"current\\" player who is shown in the uniform of what is now his former team (although, as in the case of Ricky Williams and Vinny Testaverde, sometimes they actually come back).<br /><br />Because these teams \\"only\\" go back to the old AFL, Woods does not have to go way back in the history of professional football, just to the days of \\"Cookie\\" Gilchrist, Babe Parilli, and Gino Gappelletti.  Hopefully young fans will enjoy reading about the great players and teams of the past, and fans of the Buffalo Bills will learn about the back-to-back AFL titles they won in 1964-65 and not just the four consecutive Super Bowls they lost in the 1990s.  More knowledgeable fans will find it ironic that besides Don Shula the only member of the undefeated Dolphins who gets his picture in the book is not Griese or Larry Csonka but Mercury Morris.  But there are still plenty of familiar names from Jim Kelly and Dan Marino to Curtis Martin and Tom Brady.<br /><br />The back of the book contains several pages of Stat Stuff, where you can see the relatively similar Team Records (the four teams have won 288 to 399 wins).  There is a list of the Members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and AFC East Career Leaders (through 2002) for each team, where names from the past like Steve Grogan, Gary Yepremian, and Don Maynard are listed.  There is also a Glossary of terms from \\"Achilles tendon\\" to \\"wild card,\\" a Time Line from the AFL being formed in 1960 with the Bills, Titans, and Patriots to New England winning Super Bowl XXXVI in 2001, and a list of books and web sites where young fans can go For More Information about the AFC East and the NFL, with the emphasis on the latter (so if you want to find a book about the history of one of these teams, unless you are a Dolphins fan you have to keep looking).  Still, this series does provide a solid starting point for young football fans to learn about the history of the game through the stories of these teams.and Vinny Testaverde, sometimes they actually come back). <br /> <br />Because these teams \\"only\\" go back to the old AFL, Woods does not have to go way back in the history of professional football, just to the days of \\"Cookie\\" Gilchrist, Babe Parilli, and Gino Gappelletti.

Brock fails on all counts.<br /><br />For example, are methanogens Archaea, Bacteria or Eukarya, or are they some combination of the above?  Brock assures us that many are \\"prokaryotes.\\"<br /><br />The methanogens are discussed in three widely-separated chapters.  In the first we learn that their substrates include hydrogen and formate.  In the second we learn that their substrates are carbon dioxide, methanol and acetate.  In the third we learn that they are a major source of atmospheric methane, except of course in termite hindguts, where acetogenesis is much more important.<br /><br />Nowhere is there a clear distinction of energy sources, electron acceptors and carbon sources in microbial metabolism.  Nowhere are the environmental factors which determine microbial ecology (redox potentials, nutrient sources) even mentioned.  Nowhere is methane even mentioned as a greenhouse gas.<br /><br />Nowhere is there a clear distinction among electron transport mechanisms in the Archaea, the Bacteria and the Eukarya.  The most fundamental discoveries in modern biology are buried beneath a mass of interesting but largely irrelevant facts which appear to be inherited, piecemeal, from the first ten editions of this archaic and truly worthless textbook.<br /><br />But let's give the authors and publisher of this $140.00 internet-enabled-copyright-2006 textbook their due.  The most enjoyable reading for me was the breathless Preface:<br /><br />\\"...the principles stand up and shout, the details are complementary, and the supporting concepts well integrated.\\"<br /><br />\\"BBOM 11/e is pedagogically geared towards today's visual learner...Concept checks remain and are now signaled by a bright red 'stop sign!'...the new table design should be a winner with both students and instructors alike...Many other pedagogically useful features will make themselves obvious to the reader as s/he proceeds through this book.\\"<br /><br />With a product like that, how can you go wrong?<br /><br />I was quite disappointed with this book, and I believe that I wasted my money.

Anyway, this is my first review of any kind, but I plan to write more.  Hopefully people read this review and I hope it helps.  I felt compelled to write it for one simple reason:  I started to realize that the authors are milking the Dune story, or beating a dead horse, and by the time I started reading the edited chapters, I thought who cares?  Let's see how the Dune saga ends.  Unlike a review I read earlier, I do not think the authors are hacks.  For the most part, I have enjoyed the six prequels and the short stories, and I think its cool that Frank Herbert's son found the safe deposit box full of his dad's notes and outlines, but let's get on with it, let's FINALLY get see the ending.  I guess the first part will be out in a year or so, but why, why break it into two books?  Then, there is talks of a new trilogy (!) I will read the final two installments, but after that, the ride stops for me.  But, it is neat to see that Herbert's son loves and respects his father, but they have made enough money off the story and giving this book three stars is fairly generous.  Anyway, if you like these books, the Dark Tower series is good as well as Banewreaker and Godslayer by Jacqueline Carey.  Peace be with you always!	2005-10-09

The 4th edition covers C# / .NET 2.0 which introduces many new features compared to 1.x (e.g. generics), and which is the standard platform for Visual Studio 2005 developers. If you're a Visual Studio .NET 2003 developer, you'll need to upgrade (or download a beta version) in order to run some of the examples. This is a book about the C# language rather than .NET, so reading this book will not turn you into a proficient Windows/Web Forms programmer. However, it provides an essential foundation for further reading on more advanced .NET topics. Jesse Liberty writes in a fairly readable style, and I particularly liked the small sections contrasting the way C# does something with similar techniques in C++, Visual Basic and Java. Some of the code examples feel a bit verbose: several times the same long listing appears in full with minor changes between each version. The organization of the book also felt a little quirky, with important topics like streams and threads relegated to the back of the book, appearing after much more obscure discussions of marshalling and remoting. In general though, a good introduction to C# 2.0.	2005-10-09

When I was a freshmen in college, my English 101 teacher told us that the single most important aspect of higher education was critical thinking. I agreed. But what our professors teach us as being the most significant element of thinking may not ring so true in their own methodology.<br /><br />Case in point: Living Religions by Mary Pat Fisher. While her book resounds in vast amounts of research and supplies us with a wealth of solid information, it is not fair, and Fisher's bias as a known universalist (she's a devout follower of interfaith guru, Baba Virsa Singh) rings true by the end of the book. Here are some examples:<br /><br />* Although Islam, Judaism, and Christianity all follow the code of one God worship, the book questions whether that is really true in all three faiths. To be a Muslim, part of your daily routine is saying, \\"There is no God but Allah.\\" To be a Jew, you must acknowledge the fact that Yahweh, the one true God of Judaism. He says in Isaiah, \\"There were no Gods before me, and none after me.\\" As for Christianity, Jesus says, \\"No one comes to the Father but through me\\" and later, Peter states, \\"There is no other name under heaven by which we must be saved.\\" In other words, the aforementioned religions are all EXCLUSIVELY MONOTHEISTIC. Yet, Fisher, in her last chapter, depicts religions as one in the same, stopping just short of the always useful but never logical, \\"Religions are like cars\\" routine, \\"they all take you to the same place but by different roads.\\"<br /><br />This is NOT critical thinking. It is conformist group thinking and religious pluralism. A true \\"critical thinker\\" would know that Buddhism and Christianity strictly contradict, with Buddhism believing in multiple deaths(reincarnation) while Christianity teaches that \\"it is appointed once for man to die, and than the judgement.\\"  A critical thinker would also know that Hinduism and Judaism conflict wherein Hinduism teaches that there are 330 MILLION gods and Judaism (like Islam) teaches that there is only true one.<br /><br />* She points to the idea that Muslims may not be correct with their one god belief, saying that the true text means \\"one reality\\". It's not difficult to read between the lines and see her bias in these passages.  With Jews and Christians, she points out supposed sexism and contradictory elements in Genesis, but never mentions the full context, nor does she apply this same formula to the religions that are more universal, essentially questioning those that practice monotheism but nary a peep about the pluralist faiths.<br /><br />* Fisher asserts that many teachings in the Jewish and Christian Bibles are metaphorical without giving any real value to her statements. What does she base this on and how does she decide what is literal and what is not? And wouldn't you know it, Mohammed was a real nice, open-minded guy in Fisher's view. She never once mentions how he put those non-faith peoples to the blade if they didn't convert to Islam or taxed the Christians and Jews to the point where many had to leave Islamic lands.<br /><br />Critical, objectively BALANCED thinking is not found in this book. Although Fisher appears objective to an eager, novice mind, the subtleties of her intent become more and more apparent with each new chapter.<br /><br />\\"Critical thinking?\\" I think not.m) teaches that there is only true one.<br /><br />* She points to the idea that Muslims may not be correct with their one god belief, saying that the true text means \\"one reality\\".

The book teaches the basics of sportsbetting, terminology, understanding odds, and methods to make bets that should win in the long-term. This is an excellent primer on someone who is serious about making money from sports.<br /><br />The material is slightly dated - internet betting has made the sports markets more efficient. Notwithstanding this, most of the material is still useful (notable exceptions are trends of super bowl teams, and some underdog analysis).<br /><br />There is a recurring emphasis on mathematics, which any solid gambling book should have. Additionally, the book has several charts that are invaluable to sports bettors. It has frequences of pushes for NFL against different spreads, as well as different totals (these have not changed significantly since the book was published). Additionally, it has odds charts for Poisson distributions for 1 and 2 variables. While an advanced gambler could generate all these charts themselves, this book still saves the newer gamblers many hours - and the book is worth it for these alone.<br /><br />If you are serious about gambling to win (which means you are willing to put in long hours, and are very disciplined), there are a few other books you might consider: any of Stanford Wong's Blackjack Books; Larry Seidel's \\"Investing in College Basketball\\" and Don Pesynski's \\"Win more-- lose less!\\".	2005-10-09

I truly enjoyed it and now my wife is missing. :)  She picked up the book as soon as I was done, which is never the case.

I find it to be an irony that the author high handedly cautions children not to lie like former President Bill Clinton did then goes on to lie to them that he was impeached. President Clinton was NOT impeached. To try and manipulate young minds based on her own political leanings no matter what they are is unconscionable and pathetic. She should teach history but leave the parents to do the rest as she is obviously very unqualified. I can only hope that the author doesn't have offspring of her own. I am personally making sure this offensive book is brought to the attention of every teacher at my child's school and my local public library to request that it by removed from the shelves. I suggest reprinting with the truth this time - something we should all espouse - perhaps Ms. St. George could look to the page on Lincoln to get a clue.	2005-10-09

Still, there could have been at least some information about gardening and conservation when the author discusses the individual plants.  Instead, the author provides the type of shallow discussion one finds in a seed catalog.  I would think that people who want to use native plants to garden would would want some information about a plant's ecology--at least enough to know where to site a plant.	2005-10-09

I usually only read nonfiction and after I read this, I think I'll stick to what I know.<br /><br />This book was overly simplistic and just plain ridiculous.  I could have told you the ending by page 50.  It was supposed to take place in current time but you would never know it by how some of the characters spoke.  The plot was laughable the ending was just plain stupid.  This book was aggravating to read, my husband had to hear me constantly yell, `oh, you've got to be kidding me with this crap'.<br /><br />I'm not big into fiction, I get more out of a story that I know actually happened however if you want a good suspense fiction book try `Tell No One'  and at least get your moneys worth.	2005-10-09

Esta novela es el robo de tiempo ms grande que puedes hacerle a tu persona.   Es de ideas simplsimas, totalmente vaca y vulgar (no en el sentido de grosera, que lo es, aunque de modo inofensivo, sino vulgar en el sentido de que las ideas son completamente primitivas y corrientes).   Digamos que podra haber sido una buena novelita, para pasar el tiempo, si midiera 160 pginas. Con este tema, sus personajes (pauprrimos, por cierto) daban para un librito de extensiones tipo J Ibargengotia (sin esa calidad, dejemos claro). No para que se le dediquen 700 pginas.   Parece que el autor concibi su librito y lo termin en 90 pginas. Luego le meti paja y redundancia a ms no poder, para obtener el peso de 700 gramos que quera y sentir as que su novela era de dimensiones tipo G Gras o M Vargas Llosa.   Eso es este libro. 90 pginas interesantes, intercaladas a lo largo de otras 600 pginas de paja pura. Todo el tiempo est la narradora hablando las mismas 5 ideas, que si ser naca es feo, que si Nefastfeles te escupe y te sientes cucaracha (esa idea es repetida 900 veces, pero mediante 1800 prrafos de un tercio de pgina).   La termin solamente por disciplina, y porque mantuve, sin xito, la esperanza de que mejorara, que tanta publicidad no poda ser en vano (al final lo fue).   Es tan mala, que me surgi la idea de escribir. Si este libro gan un premio de 200,000 dlares, cualquiera que sea amigo de Prez Reverte y con esos contactos lo gana.   (Despus supe que el autor es amigo de Prez Reverte, jurado del premio. Ahora entiendo).   El autor resuelve sus problemas con las salidas ms simples del mundo, infantiles.   Una gema es cuando la protagonista escapa de un problema y en Mxico DF (si, Mxico DF) encuentra una casa con la reja abierta, el coche abierto, las llaves puestas (en el DF), se sube, lo prende y se esta ah una hora quitndose el fro. Luego se baja y se va. Y nadie lo nota (en Mxico DF).   Yo creo que todos esos que dicen que Violetta es ungran personaje, etc. no conocen a Ignatius Relly, a Oscar Mazerath, a don Quijote, a Shelock Holmes, al cura del Poder y la Gloria, etc. En tierra de ciegos, el tuerto es rey.   Si quieres conocer un personaje detestablemente entraable, hazte un favor y lee la Conjura de los Necios, o si tienes ganas de leer 700 pginas, hazte un mayor favor y mejor lee el Tambor de Hojalata.   No 700 pginas de paja redundante.   Un desperdicio total.	2005-10-09

We really admire Parker for having the knowledge and creativity to \\"dream\\" up a new Philip Marlowe some fifty years after the original \\"Big Sleep\\" {1939} was published.  We may be influenced by having just recently read Chandler's original first novel (so it was fresh in our mind), but we thought Parker did a great job.  First, his use of literal quotation from the original made an effective prologue as well as effective transitions for the plot line that continued in his sequel.  Second, his replication of Marlowe, with which he had prior experience in finishing Chandler's last work, Poodle Springs {to which Chandler only contributed the first four chapters}, was so credible we barely missed the masterful prose of the series creator.<br /><br />In the story, the younger of (now deceased) General Sternwood's daughters, Carmen, is missing from a sanitarium to which she was committed as part of the outcome of \\"Sleep\\".  Her sister Vivian, with whom Marlowe eventually became infatuated enough to bed, wants her found, but turned to another of her friends from the first book, Eddie Mars, to find.  Meanwhile Norris the butler hires Marlowe to do the same, and ironically he and Eddie form an unlikely alliance at times to pursue matters.  Before it's over, a scheme to make a millionaire out of the sanitarium founder, in cohorts with a wealthy land baron recluse, is uncovered; as is the perpetrator of a couple more killings along the way.  Naturally the urbane but dogged Marlowe finds time in between drinking, smoking, and wowing attractive women, to unravel all and ride off into the sunset as a hero.<br /><br />Some might quibble that Parker is a mediocre substitute for Mr. Chandler, but who might be up to the task of stringing wordcraft in that author's stead?  We found Parker's plot quite entertaining in its own merits and his ability to credibly bring Marlowe back to life after fifty years quite remarkable.  We enjoyed the book immensely, and found it no unworthy companion to his main man Spenser.  Indeed, we commend this book to Chandler and Marlowe devotees!anion to his main man Spenser.  Indeed, we commend this book to Chandler and Marlowe devotees! <br />	2005-10-09

For the past year, this book has been like a bible for me. After 12 years of misery and confusion with my ex, this book answered why, as the title suggests. <br /> <br />But what has prompted me to review this book today is that it helped me spot a controlling man and avoid getting into a relationship with him. I just broke it off with him this morning!! I am ABSOLUTELY sure that if I not had read this book (over and over again), I would not have spotted the warning signs that Bancroft provides in this book. The book has made me very sensitive to controlling behavior, and I was able to see that this guy was controlling almost immediately--after only one date and a week's worth of email. Below, I describe what happened and some of the 4 warning signs I spotted, if you're interested. <br /> <br />On the first, 3-hour date, he talked and talked, didn't ask me ONE question (except if I wanted to go out again), and constantly changed the topic back to him. I initially assumed he was nervous. But, one warning sign Bancroft points out in the book is that abusive men are SELF-CENTERED, and the book exactly described this guy's behavior. Plus, when I looked back at my initial email communication with him (we met online), I noticed that he wrote tons about himself, asked me only two questions, and rarely commented on what I wrote. <br /> <br />Then, after the first date, the guy began emailing me twice a day. He started calling me beautiful and sweetie. He did this after I told him I wanted to take things slow. (I told him this because he attempted to plan two dates on our first meeting-one at his home.) So, this guy raised another red flag pointed out in the book: HE GETS SERIOUS TOO QUICKLY ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP. <br /> <br />Also, the guy told me on the first date that he likes to date only one person at a time. It was like he implied that he wanted me to do the same. I was just getting to know him! He also later said he had this \\"weird problem with having multiple contacts with different people at the same time,\\" and that he is \\"highly monogamous.\\" Also, one day early in our email communication, he jokingly asked me whether I was checking out other guys online. Initially, this \\"highly monogamous\\" attitude may seem commendable. However, this attitude is actually another red flag pointed out by Bancroft: HE IS POSSESSIVE.  <br /> <br />Finally, the last red flag this guy raised was that HE IS DISRESPECTFUL TOWARD ME. Three requests I made to him were not respected.  <br /> <br />I told him I wanted to take it slow, but he started calling me beautiful and sweetie and continued emailing me twice daily.  <br /> <br />He asked me if I wanted to go out to dinner with his sister and parents--on our second date! (His sister came into town unexpectedly, on the same night he and I planned to go out, and we were invited to tag along with the family.) When I declined and gave my reason, he didn't respond with \\"OK.\\" Rather, he wanted me to first re-explain my reason.  <br /> <br />When I emailed him that I didn't want to continue with the relationship because it felt unbalanced (he appeared to like me more than I liked him), his response was \\"Wow! All I did is ask you out for a second date....you are killing me LOL [laugh out loud]!!!!!\\"  <br /> <br />One request he ignored (taking it slow), another request he questioned (going out with his family), and my last request was not taken seriously (his \\"LOL!!!\\" response to me wanting to end the relationship). <br /> <br />Of course, I don't know 100% that this guy is controlling and some people may think I overreacted, but I wasn't sticking around to find out. And it is not one or two of his behaviors: It was a PATTERN of behavior. <br /> <br />This is literally my favorite book, and I would suggest that EVERY woman read it.	2005-10-09

Unlike some of Robbin's programs that require a stricter format, the 'Unleash' program allows you to excel at your own pace (bit by bit or all at once).<br /><br />Each tape covers a facet of different topics ranging from 'Creating a Revolution in Your Life', 'Critical Q's to ask yourself', 'The three steps to creating lasting change'(...I could go on and on) and they are all arranged to bring you to the next step.  I liked this program because I could listen to it in the car and, when I got home/at work, I could pop open the guidebook and go thru step-by-step exercises.  They are short exercises, but very empowering.<br /><br />I began reading/listening to Robbins for years now.  I have listened to everything Robbins has published many times over and it's funny how I'll pop in a tape or cd and hear something completely new for the very first time (and then it 'clicks').  If your new to Anthony Robbins, this program is a great place to start.  For the pro's, it's a must-have refresher with a number of different concepts.	2005-10-09

Not only was the photography and descriptions of the families brilliant, but Menzel included excerpts from leading nutritionists, scientists, environmentalists, and my own personal heroes among them Michael Pollen. I especially enjoyed the articles entitled Diabesity and Slow Foods. Another brilliant aspect is the pertinent facts about the countries that the familes come from, which include not only geographics, population density, and life expectancies but also number of McDonald's, the % of obese and overweight, and the consumption of alcohol and cigarettes.<br /><br />Menzel and D'Alusio were also keen to write personal experiences in the countries they visited- the shock of seeing Ramen noodles in Papua New Guinea, or eating dugo (my aunt's personal favorite) congealed swine blood in Manilla.

We want our DVDs packed with \\"making of\\" featurettes. We want to go backstage with the band. We want our favorite foods \\"unwrapped\\" (as in the Food TV series). Ruth Reichl's book is the perfect memoir those of us who (1) have the \\"behind the scenes\\" fascination and (2) love food.     If you've ever wanted to know how food critics prepare for, think about, and write their reviews, this is the book for you.  In it, Ms. Reichl traces her journey from the Los Angeles Times to the New York Times, shares how her husband had to talk her into the job, how the previous food critic Bryan Miller organized a smear campaign against her, how she disguised herself time and again to avoid being recognized by sharp-eyed restaurant staff.    Like any good tour of New York City, we get to see an awful lot along the way.  We see the petty editorial politics at the New York Times. We see the sometimes funny and often surprisingly bitter reactions readers have to reviews. We see the once fringe ethnic cuisines (e.g., Korean) go mainstream. We see all the New York Times writers cower in fear of Al Siegal, the notorious editor whose job it was to publicly ridicule writing not up to the notoriously high standards of the paper.    Ms. Reichl weaves a rich tapestry of characters through her memoir, from her boy Nick to the wig seller who helps her perfect her disguises; from fellow food celebrities such as Ken Hom to Claudia Banks, the acting coach who helps her flesh out each of the identities she assumes.  But it's Living section administrative Carol Shaw who steals the show as the most richly rendered, three dimensional character. You can't be help liking her.    Ms. Reichl writes honestly and poignantly. She's as critical of herself as she is of the worst restaurants in New York City.  In one memorable scene, her husband excuses himself early. Thinking that he left to get away from an obnoxious dinner guest, Ms. Reichl is startled todiscover it was actually to get away from her:     ----    \\"I couldn't say and watch what you were doing. I hate it when you pretend to be that person.\\"    \\"What person?\\" she asks.    \\"The Restaurant Critic of the New York Times. The Princess of New York. Ms.-I-know-I-am-right-about-food-and-don't-argue-with-me. Take your pick.\\"    \\"What I that bad?\\" I whispered.  My cheeks burned and I could feel the sweat prickling against my skin.    \\"Worse,\\" he said. \\"You were the person you used to make fun of.\\"    ----    All in all, this is a great, memorable read.	2005-10-09

There is nothing in here about the conflicting forces wihtin her, and everything about her desire to please her master.  In all, I was very very disappointed with this book and I ended up throwing it away since I (unfortunately) didn't read it until after the 30-day return period.	2005-10-09

He came to be one of its strongest popular advocates.<br /><br />The soldiers and administrators of the British Raj felt a sense of mission.  They believed strongly in doing their duty and \\"improving\\" the lives of Indians, often with the self-righteousness of religious conviction.  They were optimistic and often self-sacrificing in serving their Empire.<br /><br />While admirable in many ways, such people were also often ignorant, intolerant and<br /><br />contemptuous of the ways of the people they ruled and dwelt amongst.<br /><br />Kipling captures the optimism and energy of those vanished times.  His writing is wonderfully evocative of the era.  While his characters are brilliantly drawn, they are  mostly caricatures and stereotypes that his readers in India would have recognised only<br /><br />too well.<br /><br />One character that really grates today is Private Mulvaney, the stereotypical Irish soldier who features in several stories.  \\"The Daughter of the Regiment\\" is almost unreadable because Kipling tries to replicate Mulvaney's speech with text like: \\"Ould Pummeloe was sittin' on her beddin'-rowl, thryin' to kape little Jhansi quiet.\\"  Also to be avoided is \\"The Madness of Private Ortheris.\\"<br /><br />Stories like \\"The Gate of the Hundred Sorrows\\" deal compellingly with one of the more<br /><br />notorious blights on the Raj - opium.<br /><br />Despite their jingoism, Kipling's stories are still worth reading.  Apart from their<br /><br />literary merit, they demonstrate that some things never change.  Among some leaders today we also see self-righteousness wrapped in religious zeal as they seek to change the ways of other peoples at almost any cost to those people.<br /><br />We need to be reminded that this has all happened before and, in its turn, will pass<br /><br />away.  As the poem Ozymandias puts it \\"Nothing besides remains.  Round the decay of that colossal wreck the lone and level sands stretch far away\\".uts it \\"Nothing besides remains.

After reading this you will have a clearer picture of how dictatorships work in general, and how men like Sadam Hussein could use the same pattern of terror and constant purging to maintain control.  In Stalin's world the idealogy of marxism became simply a macheovelian ploy to subdue the masses, any shred of emotion or decency is used against you, empathy and caring are as good as death certificates.<br /><br />Radzinsky, already renowned as a playwright and biographer has, an entertaining writing style and is not afraid to propose new theories based on his tireless research.  The Cover claims that the book is based on 'explosive new documents from Russia's secret archives' and it does not dissapoint in that regard.  With all the disinformation and revisionism that occured in the Soviet archives, piecing together a coherrent story must have been exceedingly difficult. However Radzinsky makes compelling cases for the assination of Stalin by Beri, Krushcev et al. with the knowledge of the leaders of the politburo among other things.  My question is why did it take so long to take him out!!!  Also fascinating is his portrayal of Molitov, the genius brown-noser who could not make even the simplest decision without direct advice from the leader, who mindlessly signed off on atrocities, and even regretted abstaining from voting that his own wife to be purged(though admittedly he may have saved his life in doing so)!  If people like Molotov are the only kind that can survive in your organization it might be a good idea to look elsewhere if you have a choice.<br /><br />My main criticism of the book would be that it spends a couple of hundred pages describing theories behind hunderds of political killing and it becomes skimmingly redundant.  We see the planning and strategy behind the first and second major purges. Sergei Kirov a war hero who was killed for being popular, and how the 'mystery' behind is death is turned around and used against all of Stalin's enemies and competitiors.<br /><br />The heplessness of politial rivals such as Trotsky and paticularly of Bukharrin where we get the text of several letters he wrote while on death row, unable to come to terms with the ruthlessness of his foe.  Though mortal political manuevering is despisable, the major tragedy here is in the collectivazation of the peasentry and the destruction of their culture, and the starvation that it caused when they were forced to make steel instead of wheat.  Not enough emphasis is put on that.  We do however get a good sense of the grip of terror on the entire society where everything is sensored, from a letter to your cousin or an innocent conversation on a train, and where govt agents frequently come and take whole families away seemingly at random in the middle of the night for the slightest preceived offense. In this we see the difficulty and time it would take to have a productive democracy in a place like Iraq or even China.<br /><br />Reading Macheaveli's 'The Prince' is a rather tiresome intellectual exercise, but with Stalin we see it put into action with devestating results.<br /><br />From this I  get a tangible sense of why it is never a good idea to consolidate power into the hands of the very few.  Though there may be a few good kings out there, eventually you will get a Nero, Stalin, etc.  As flawed as it may be, any political system which flollows peaceable transfer of power over short intervals with an open press and right of protest is vastly, vastly superior to indeffinate dictatorship with absolute power.<br /><br />For comparison I would say this books ranks as high as the fantastic autobiography of the clever Nazi, Albert Speer.r purges.

Copernicus and other Renaissance intellectuals took \\"man\\" out of the center of the universe. Now Stewart and others are putting humanity back at the center but in a radically different way from the theocrats. Contrary to the conventional view that evolution is just adaptation to existing circumstances, without any overall direction, Stewart identifies two unifying themes in evolution. First and foremost is the drive toward greater cooperation among organisms due to the huge payoffs in survival that such cooperation yields. Second is the drive towards better mechanisms of adaptability itself, yielding much more rapid evolution with fewer dead ends.<br /><br />Humanity is identified as the ultimate in both cooperation and adaptability among current organisms. Planetary society, or global governance, is next on the cooperation agenda. Oral traditions and now print and electronic media have already yielded a fantastic increase in adaptability. This is cultural, not genetic, adaptability, but all nature cares is that it is effective both within a single lifetime and between generations. Next on this agenda is a much deeper psychic ability that will enable individuals to achieve satisfaction through pursuit of a visionary planetary society, transcending existing, recreation, entertainment, family, work, community, etc. Others who are of the optimistic sort, might proclaim genetic engineering of humans as the next wave of adaptability, but Stewart only looks at genetic engineering of other organisms.<br /><br />Another book that sees a possible evolutionary breakthrough by humanity is \\"Promise Ahead - A Vision of Hope and Action for Humanity's Future\\" by Duane Elgin of \\"Voluntary Simplicity\\" fame. A major difference is that Elgin looks at environmental barriers to humanity's success - climate change, resources exhaustion like Peak Oil, etc in the face of massive population. Instead Stewart looks at evolutionary barriers to cooperation. That is, the most primitive evolutionary force is reproduction of the individual organism, but individual success may spell doom for the greater success yielded by cooperation. This is the \\"prisoner's dilemma\\" of game theory. Example: when our individual cells attempt to proliferate at will, we get cancer and die.<br /><br />So Stewart identifies how this barrier was overcome at each stage of evolution, from primordial soups of reproducing proteins to modern humans, usually by a strong \\"manager\\". For humans we had the subordination of the individual to the family and the tribe, now to the corporation and the state and much in-between. Principal problems to overcome are the \\"freeloaders\\" and \\"cheats\\". Religion and mythology used to play a dominant role as manager in enforcing community norms and morals, but these are also a barrier to creative change, hence the emergence of the modern secular state. This in turn has left a somewhat hedonistic individualism in its wake, which could be cured by the transformative view of Evolution espoused by Stewart. A more dramatic, visual, and spiritual version Stewart's Evolution is the \\"Great Story\\" of the universe presented by Michael Dowd and Connie Barlow.<br /><br />Stewart even tackles the problem of how to make global governance work. He says that \\"vertical markets\\" would introduce adaptability into governance. Governance is now adaptable by passing new laws but is hamstrung by static constitutions and by the rigidity of the laws themselves when faced with complex and poorly understood societal problems. A vertical market in governance would open many governmental tasks to bidding by private entrepreneurs. However the idea is to solicit different ways of defining and performing the tasks themselves, not straight forward implementation of previously defined tasks. To a certain extent this is already done by the \\"requests for proposals\\" that are used in some areas of government contracting. Stewart would extend this to a much higher level, to the legal and even constitutional arena, with the public having a much larger say in the contract awards.<br /><br />Of course it is a severe challenge to get the public involved in a way that serves the larger public interest, not that of special interests, which often have the most knowledge or financial interest. This is where many of the techniques of \\"deep democracy\\" enter, including advanced methods of deliberation and polling. Since you'd need to regularly re-bid these contracts, you'd also have a major problem of personnel management:  workforce turnover and disruption of careers as strategies are shifted by these new engineers of civil society. A possible solution would be a more universal civil service system to maintain benefits and career development across varying societal roles. These issues are not discussed by Stewart.<br /><br />Stewart's discussion of \\"linear\\" vs \\"systemic\\" modeling is somewhat confused. The former is identified with simple cause and effect logical analysis, the latter with more complex multivariable analysis that requires deep insight, needed for more advanced levels of cooperation. However linear analysis, as mathematically understood, can involve any number of variables, as long as the multiplications are by constant numbers or matrices. Thus straight forward scaling, not cause and effect, is what makes linear models easy to understand and to use. Much cause and effect reasoning is actually nonlinear, often involving discrete, not continuous, quantities.<br /><br />Dynamic nonlinear models involving feedback loops and the like are probably what Stewart means by \\"systemic\\" modeling. Classic examples are the world scenarios developed for the \\"Limits to Growth\\" study, plus many narrower economic, social, biological, and environmental models. The crucial insights are into the qualitative behaviors of such models, including such phenomena as convergence to a steady state or to cyclical behavior, divergence, overshoot and oscillation, bifurcation, and chaos. Discrete models like cellular automata would also qualify as systemic, as would iterated nonlinear equations. Here is where computer simulations can greatly extend real world experience, but this is not mentioned by Stewart. To expect insightful systemic modeling by a significant portion of humanity without widespread use of such tools seems highly utopian to me.<br /><br />These quibbles aside, \\"Evolution's Arrow\\" is groundbreaking work and a quick, easy read to boot.much higher level, to the legal and even constitutional arena, with the public having a much larger say in the contract awards.  <br /> <br />Of course it is a severe challenge to get the public involved in a way that serves the larger public interest, not that of special interests, which often have the most knowledge or financial interest.

This new \\"Wonderful\\" book from John Swartzwelder revolves around the folks of Slackjaw, Kansas & their search for something more.  Not only are they unable get their town as famous as Dodge City or Tombstone, they can't seem to get it noticed at all.  Even the outlaws they've invited to town (some of the most infamous, from Billy the Kid to Billy No-Pants) were scared off because the citizens of the town were over-eager (everyone pretending to be dead in the streets, leaving the bank vault wide-open).  They've tried everything but their tourist trade is still doing terribly. <br /> <br />The world-famous Betty & Buck Wonderful, owners of the Double Wonderful Ranch, can't seem to help them, either (though they sell them plenty of high quality Betty & Buck merchandise at cost).  All seems lost until a stranger shows up to town & changes their lives, forever. <br /> <br />A hilarious satire of not only the Old West, including many Old West stereotypes the author successfully flips on their heads, but of fame & celebrities.  Add to that Swartzwelder's often absurd, off-beat comedy throughout and you end up with a thoroughly delightful read. <br /> <br />Highly recommended, not just for fans of the Old West but for fans of great comedy.	2005-10-09

His book is an example of dangerous extremism that can serve to only create division in the Church (He of course blames all division on the \\"Contemporaries,\\" rather than acknowledging that those on both sides of the issue can create this division).  He paints with far too broad of brush when he describes attitudes of those who use and, yes, promote the use of CCM in our churches.  When refering to Contemporaries view of worship, he states the meaning of the word \\"...no longer refers to the biblical practice of bowing in reverence and humility before a holy God.\\"  This is EXACTLY what most \\"Contemporaries\\" believe worship entails. Anyone who describes songs such as Lord We Lift Your Name on High, Hosanna, Refiner's Fire (and any other CCM that has any degree of a sycopated beat)as \\"vulgar and profane\\" is an extremist.   <br />The book is full of inflammatory statements based predominantly  on his OPINIONS.  He claims to use Scripture to support his statements, when in actuality, his reasoning leads him to misuse the Bible passages.  He is blind to the fact that most of the selected Scriptures could just as easily be used to support the position of the \\"Contemporaries.\\"  Once his primary premise that any synopated beat is inherently sinful is logically rejected, the rest of the book becomes pure rambling. Spend your money elsewhere.  I agree with those who have advised that the best text on appropriate worship is your Bible.  And finally, spend time on your knees praying for those like this well-meaning but seriously misdirected author.	2005-10-09

Written by Scotswoman Elizabeth MacIntosh, who wrote under the pen name Josephine Tey, it was first published in 1951. It is tragic that the author died in 1952 and was never to know the pleasure that this book would bring to generations of readers and that the Mystery Writers of America would ultimately rank it fourth among the one hundred best mysteries ever written.<br /><br />The title of the book is derived from a historical source, as it is attributable to Sir Francis Bacon, \\"For truth is rightly named after the daughter of time, and not of authority.\\" The book itself is not a traditional mystery but rather an application of deductive reasoning to an actual historical event. The event in question is the murder of the princes in the tower, sons of King Edward IV, allegedly by their uncle, Richard III, who eventually usurped the English throne after the death of his brother. It has been widely held that Richard III did, indeed, murder the two young princes, his nephews, in order to secure his claim to the throne.<br /><br />The reader is introduced to Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant, who is hospitalized and recovering from injuries sustained in the line of duty. While convalescing, he becomes intrigued by a picture of a portrait of Richard III, a likeness with which he is unfamiliar. Grant is puzzled that someone with such a sensitive face could have been such a monster as to murder his two nephews in cold blood. So, our intrepid Inspector decides that he will reconsider the evidence upon which such a dastardly assumption has been based. With the help of an American researcher doing the necessary legwork, Grant compiles enough archival historical fact that incrementally helps him formulate a new theory as to who actually may have murdered the princes in the tower.<br /><br />This analysis and reformulation is done as though it were being argued to a jury. Indeed, so persuasive is Inspector Grant through the application of some insightful deductive reasoning and clever dialogue that the reader comes away thinking that Grant has solved one of the most intriguing historical mysteries of all time. This is certainly an unusual book conceptually but one that succeeds brilliantly. It should appeal to those readers who enjoy having a mystery unraveled, as well as to those who harbor a love of English history. Bravo!rant through the application of some insightful deductive reasoning and clever dialogue that the reader comes away thinking that Grant has solved one of the most intriguing historical mysteries of all time.

Ever since World War II when my father was a Marine, my uncle a Sailor, I've always admired men in uniform.  How handsome they were to an impressionable young girl like me.  But I've grown up since then, and don't read Captain Meadows's great military novels to envision those hunky military guys in uniform ... (but tell that to my daughter!  Ha-ha!). <br /> <br />I read all of this author's books in the SIXTH FLEET series and am avidly devouring his JOINT TASK FORCE series.  Although--from reading his books--Meadows's fans are bound to learn many things about the Navy and other branches of the military and about strategic planning during cold wars and hot ones, that is not my reason for being his number one fan. <br /> <br />Pure and simple, it's the excitement ... the edge-of-the seat, nail-biting scenes, and the spirit of adventure that pulls me into his stories.  And WHAT stories he has to tell. Awesome! <br /> <br />I look forward to the upcoming (or did I miss the start of it?) TV series, starring that fine actor, Gene Hackman.   <br /> <br />I'm a fan for life, so I hope Captain Meadows continues with this series and then writes another ... and another ... and another.  I look forward to heading out to sea with him and his amazing crew of brave sailors.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

I finally made it through the hold list at the library for Robin Cook's latest novel Marker.  I'm never quite sure if I'm going to like or hate each of his novels, as the story lines seem to hit me as varying in quality.  Marker is better than some of his other ones, and I enjoyed it.  It's not without some nits in my opinion, however...<br /><br />Laurie Montgomery is a medical examiner at the city morgue.  She starts running across a number of deaths that are unexpected and have no pathology to indicate their cause.  Just perfectly healthy people dropping dead after routine procedures.  Her suspicions start to move towards a serial killer loose in one of the local hospitals, but of course no one wants to hear or believe that.  Amidst all of this turmoil, she's also got a number of personal crises issues to deal with, including a troubling genetic test and a relationship that's not going where she wants it to end up.  As she slowly starts getting people to buy into her killer scenario, she ends up in a situation that just might make her the next victim...<br /><br />Overall, the story wasn't bad.  It seemed to be a bit long in the middle, and I felt like we went through a few iterations of events that didn't advance the story at all.  It was just activity for the sake of activity.  The ending was great, in that I had to pick up my reading pace because I needed to find out how it all ended.  My biggest problem was the agenda that Cook is pushing in the book.  I'm not one much for personal crusades wrapped in popular fiction, and Cook seems to excel in that.  In this story, he paints the managed care industry as the evil boogieman, with genetic testing being the final invasion of our personal privacies.  While there are issues there to be sure, the \\"insurance is evil, doctors are good\\" theme got to be much too heavy for my likings.<br /><br />Fun read, and perhaps the underlying theme will resonate more with you than it did for me.  In my case, it flawed what would have otherwise been an excellent novel.ould have otherwise been an excellent novel.	2005-10-09

After playing the D20 adventure, \\"Death in Freeport,\\" my interest was piqued in the Unspeakable One and the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign.  As it turns out, both were inspired by Hastur and the Yellow Sign.  So I decided to go to the source and read the original stories that helped craft the mythology of the Great Old One known as Hastur and his crazy book, \\"The King in Yellow.\\"<br /><br />Briefly, Hastur is both a place and a being.  He/it is loosely connected to the cities of Carcosa, Yhtill, and Alar.  Hastur and Alar are divided in a battle of succession.  Yhtill is a city of the past, while Carcosa is a haunted city of the future. All of the cities are near Lake Hali. The cities are on a planet near the star Aldebaran in the Hyades, a planet with two moons and two suns.  The inhabitants may be black or white (sources disagree).<br /><br />What they all agree on is that the Phantom of Truth appears during the siege between the two cities.  The Phantom wears a mask and tells everyone else to wear a mask to avoid the appearance of the King in Yellow, who will ultimately usurp all royal successors thereafter.<br /><br />So everyone wears a mask, including the jaded and bitter Queen Camilla, her clueless daughter Cassilda, and her two sons Thale and Uoht.  The plan is that by wearing masks, everyone will be saved from the King in Yellow's inevitable appearance.  But the King in Yellow easily thwarts the Phantom of Truth, and he thereafter declares that everyone must wear a mask as well as the yellow sign, a squiggly three-armed symbol.<br /><br />Sometimes Hastur is described as the King in Yellow, sometimes he's described as the Phantom of Truth, and sometimes he looks an awful lot like Cthulhu.<br /><br />Oh yeah, someone transcribed all of this down into a play.  If you read it or watch it, you go mad.  Or you slowly get drawn into the play.  Or the characters from the play come after you.  It's complicated.<br /><br />The Second Edition of the Hastur Cycle contains 14 different stories, all of them collected by Robert M. Price into one volume.  They are loosely connected by the mythology of Hastur.  I'll try to elaborate on each story and make sense of it all...without going mad.<br /><br />\\"Haita the Shepherd\\" and \\"An Inhabitant of Carcosa\\" are both by Ambrose Bierce, he of the \\"Devil's Dictionary.\\"  In \\"Haita the Shepherd\\", a shepherd struggles in a relentless pursuit of a beautiful woman, who turns out to be an ideal.  It's a bittersweet commentary on life.  In \\"Inhabitant,\\" we discover that Bierce invented the Sixth Sense plot twist before M. Night Shyamalan. They're both short and neither are particularly riveting to a modern audience.<br /><br />HASTUR:  In \\"Haita,\\" Hastur is a benevolent deity of shepherds that Haita prays to.  Occasionally, Hastur does nice things for Haita.  But he doesn't have much of a role.  In \\"Inhabitant,\\" we have...well, an inhabitant of the city of Carcosa.  He refers to Hali as a person, not a lake.<br /><br />Robert W. Chambers wrote the next two stories, \\"The Repairer of Reputations\\" and \\"The Yellow Sign.\\"  In \\"Repairer,\\" the play known as The King in Yellow appears for the first time.  It establishes the subsequent madness that ensues by any who read The King in Yellow, as evidenced by the narrator of \\"The Repairer of Reputations.\\"  What's not immediately clear is that this story takes place in the future, where suicide chambers are government sanctioned.  The future twist muddles the story a bit, as the setting isn't relevant to the plot.  But it keeps you guessing.  \\"Yellow,\\" on the other hand, is just an out-and-out creep fest, with a zombie who keeps muttering, \\"Have you found the Yellow Sign?\\" Good stuff, dramatic endings, and in both cases the characters aren't yammering about the horrors they witnessed from the safety of the afterword, a trait all too often found in Lovecraft and his imitators.<br /><br />HASTUR: These two stories lay the foundation that reading the King in Yellow drives you bonkers.  They both hint at what happens in the first act of the play, which involves the Phantom of Truth.  And this, unfortunately, is where we learn about the hearse-driver zombie.  He will be rammed into just about every story afterwards, even where he doesn't belong.  But that's not Chambers' fault.<br /><br />\\"The River of Night's Dreaming,\\" by Karl Edward Wagner, is a decidedly modern take on the King in Yellow mythos.  It's scarier than the others, but a little less creative in forcing the main character (a young woman who has escaped prison) into the story itself, in a sort of Gothica/Misery movie scenario.  One character refers to \\"The King in Yellow\\" as \\"vintage porno,\\" and that's an adequate description of this story.  I felt a little dirty after reading it.<br /><br />HASTUR:  Unlike the other stories in this volume, \\"River\\" makes no attempt to expand or include the King in Yellow.  Instead, it focuses on repressed Victorian desires. Which is a bit of an assumption in the first place that anything in the King in Yellow has to do with the Victorian-era.<br /><br />That brings us to \\"More Light\\" by James Blish, the crown jewel of the collection.  As a story, it's not very entertaining.  It's basically a guy reading \\"The King in Yellow\\" on a dare.  It also establishes a trope that gets old fast: the narrator refers to Lovecraft's writings as if they were real.  Oh, the irony!<br /><br />HASTUR: This is the mother of all Hastur resources.  It gives us almost the entire play of The King in Yellow.  The story itself is bland, but the narrative of the play is fantastic and incorporates all the elements from the other stories.  One thing that does get a bit silly is the insistence by authors of including EVERY bit of trivia about the Hastur mythos.  The undead hearse driver from \\"The Yellow Sign\\" isn't just in the story, he's the Phantom of Truth.  In \\"The Yellow Sign\\" someone remarks that the hearse driver's finger broke off (a consequence of being a zombie) and sure enough, it's mentioned in the play.  If anything, the play is almost too thorough.  But we'll take it, as Blish manages to put the various quotes together into a cohesive whole that is rather freaky.<br /><br />The Hastur Cycle begins to stray with \\"The Novel of the Black Seal\\" by Arthur Machen.  It's nearly unreadable, because of the stilted Victorian prose.  Suffice it to say that the story involves the \\"little people\\" and their worship of the Yellow Sign, but takes such a long time to get there that you no longer care about the ending.<br /><br />HASTUR: None.  Price posits that this story served as the inspiration for \\"The Whisperer in the Darkness\\" by H.P. Lovecraft. Which is a bit of a tangent, as \\"Whisperer\\" has almost nothing to do with Hastur.<br /><br />\\"Whisperer in the Darkness\\" is one of those stories that would actually be more entertaining if it were updated.  Most of it takes place between two characters exchanging letters, with one of the authors continually updating his pen pal.  It would play much better as an email exchange.  It's even a little creepy, given that it deals with intelligent lobster fungi called Mi-Go.<br /><br />HASTUR: Lovecraft's sole contribution mentions the Brotherhood of the Yellow Sign and Hastur in passing. Supposedly, \\"there is a whole secret cult of evil men...devoted to the purpose of tracking [the Mi-Go] down and injuring them on behalf of monstrous powers from other dimensions.\\" Presumably those monstrous powers are Hastur.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Price now takes the connection of Mi-Go and goes crazy with it, spiraling off into a series of short stories that are focused on them instead of Hastur.  So we have \\"Documents in the Case of Elizabeth Akeley,\\" by Richard A. Lupoff, which is essentially a sequel to \\"Whisperer.\\"  It's followed by two short stories about humans visiting the home planet of the Mi-Go, called Yuggoth (or, as we call it, \\"Pluto\\").  They're fast reads but are wasted space foranyone who wants to learn more about Hastur.<br /><br />We finally get back to Hastur with \\"The Return of Hastur\\" by August Derleth.  Reading this, I discovered a few things: 1) Derleth's narrative leaves much to be desired, and 2) he apparently thinks a Godzilla vs. King Kong type fight between Hastur and Cthulhu makes for scary stuff.  It really, really doesn't.<br /><br />HASTUR: Derleth helps lay the groundwork for the Unspeakable Oath, gives Hastur the title \\"He Who is Not to be Named,\\" demonstrates what happens to the Chosen of Hastur, and (sadly) tries to make Hastur the half-brother of Cthulhu; like we need some big family tree of ancient horrors to make it all make sense.  Bless Derleth's heart, he does try hard.<br /><br />\\"The Feaster from Afar\\" turns Hastur into a flying boogeyman.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it contains the noteworthy death of a character.  As opposed to a character safely talking about how he narrowly escaped mind-rending horror (but is all too eager to tell us about it).<br /><br />HASTUR: Hastur sounds a lot like Cthulhu: all tentacles with a taste for brains.<br /><br />\\"Tatters of the King\\" by Lin Carter contains all kinds of interesting tidbits about Hastur.  It's actually three fragments, including a poem titled \\"Litany to Hastur,\\" a \\"Carcosa Story about Hali\\" and \\"The King in Yellow\\" in verse.<br /><br />HASTUR: Carter connects Byakhee to Hastur in \\"Tatters.\\"  Then we follow Hali (the guy, not the lake, harkening back to Bierce) as a necromancer trying to undo the curse of the undead in Carcosa.  Hastur is the Thing in the Lake (he apparently sleeps in it), and the citizens practice human sacrifice to him.  The verse is noteworthy for Price's intrusion as editor...he actually ADDS verse to the parts that are missing from Carter, who in turn took it from Blish.  I thought editors were supposed to edit, not write...and certainly not provide completely new verse into someone else's work.  But I digress.<br /><br />Ultimately, The Hastur Cycle is an important but flawed survey of Hastur mythology.  It's much less about Hastur than it is about Price's personal tastes on what stories influenced Lovecraft...as if the entire mythology's importance hinges upon Lovecraft's slim contribution.  What's missing are other stories by Chambers, such as \\"The Mask\\" and the \\"The Court of the Dragon.\\" Also missing are John Tynes' contributions, which have become part of the Hastur mythology mostly through Chaosium's support.<br /><br />Did I mention it contains the majority of \\"The King in Yellow?\\"  Read it, if you dare...s finger broke off (a consequence of being a zombie) and sure enough, it's mentioned in the play.

This fact is easily affirmed with a quick look on a crowded street. Research shows not only are more people overweight or obese, the overweight keep piling on the pounds. Sadly, this phenomenon is not just an adult problem. In the book SuperSized Kids How To Rescue Your Child From The Obesity Threat, Walt Larimore, M.D., and Sherri Flynt explore the medical consequences of obesity in today's youth and offer their medical experiences, both personal and clinical, as they attempt to tackle this worldwide crisis. Obesity does not discriminate. In fact, as this book so adeptly explains, obesity affects all persons, individually and as a society. The negative health impact is globally catastrophic in addition to financially devastating. Larimore and Flynt, with the use of reality-based case in points, attempt to explain the ravages this disease presents while offering thier medical expertise to assure us this trend can be reversed. With simple medical terminology and easy to follow lifestyle changes, these dedicated professionals make eradicating childhood obesity seem like a real possibility. While exposing probable causes of obesity, the authors are quick to point out modern luxuries and conveniences as the likeliest culprits. Except, instead of assigning blame to society and culture alone, they lay the responsibility and recovery at the feet of the individual. If the purpose of this book is to explain what obesity is, what it does, and how to prevent it, that goal was certainly attained. Larimore and Flynt give the reader every reason to be concerned and become proactive with the weight, current and future health of our next generation.<br /><br />SuperSized Kids How To Rescue Your Child From The Obesity Threat is one of many books tackling the issue of childhood obesity available today. Written to appeal to parents and caregivers, it sometimes uses over the top scare tactics to get the reader's attention. Although easy to read, the layout is a bit distracting with the pages having sidebars of Recipe For Success, Fifty Ways to SuperSize Your Kids, and/or Food For Thought. Using real life stories to emphasize the subject matter is usually a positive tool used by authors. This book employs too many. Parents who have children struggling with weight want answers and solutions, not necessarily a support group of unknowns. They already know they belong to an ever growing population and if they are reading this book, they are making strides to escape from it. From a clinical viewpoint, this books supplies plenty of facts and figures. What it doesn't do, is make them interesting. With so many other books available with the same subject matter, I suggest looking for another.<br /><br />(...)the layout is a bit distracting with the pages having sidebars of Recipe For Success, Fifty Ways to SuperSize Your Kids, and/or Food For Thought.

This is the Spanish text edition of a wonderful and highly original novel, \\"Flowers for Algernon\\", which is  about a mentally challenged man named Charlie who wanted to be smart. One day, his wish was granted. A group of scientists selected him for an experimental operation that raised his intelligence to genius level. Suddenly, Charlie found himself transformed, and life, as he knew it, changed.<br /><br />His story is told entirely through Charlie's eyes and perceptions in the form of progress reports. The reader actually sees the change in Charlie take place, as his progress reports become more complex, well written, and filled with the angst of personal discovery and growth, as well as with his gradual awareness of his amazing and accelerated intellectual development.<br /><br />The progress reports are a wonderful contrivance for facilitating the story, and the reader is one with Charlie on his voyage of self-discovery. What happens to Charlie in the long run is profoundly moving and thought provoking. It is no wonder that this author was the recipient of the Nebula Award which is given by the Science Fiction Writers of America for having written the Best Novel of the Year.

This arc probably didn't need a whole six issues, but in the digest form it's cut down a bit, making it a reasonable length for what goes on.  <br /> <br />The characters can be identified with easily, especially by teenagers, but the focus on the characters is a bit off. It isn't clearly shown in this digest if McKeever intended for San to be the main character or Tonaja, or if this is indeed a team book. Later in the series Tonaja takes the spotlight, while still keeping the team aspect of the book alive.  <br /> <br />The art is very nice, and the fantastic culture of the Inhumans is explored by the creative and beautiful penicls and inks. This is the type of book where creativity can really be used, building and characters may look quirky and unique. This opportunity was taken advantage of, creating a cohesive and amazing look to the book.  <br /> <br />With a solid story, great art, and fun characters, this digest is a winner. I'm disappointed that a second digest hasn't been published, and that the series was cancelled after just over ten issues.	2005-10-09

The venerated justice Oliver Wendell Holmes was one of the very first people whom he met - and he writes eloquently of that encounter in the Civil War chapter of this book. Finding our spirit and our optimism contagious, Cooke spent much, if not most of his life here for the next seven decades, getting the know the best and the brightest, the celebrity and the common man on the street, learned about our history with an appreciation that very few - even many Americans - have for this country.    The result is \\"Alistair Cooke's America\\" first published as a loving tribute to this country at its Bicentennial in 1976, with a revised forward in 2002, though with no mention of the tumultous events of September 11, 2001. Cooke writes movingly of our history and of the spirit of the American people, the fight for Liberty during the American Revolution, the move westward, that \\"firebell in the night\\" (to quote Thomas Jefferson) as the country tore itself apart over the question of Slavery. He writes of the Civil War, interestingly considering Antietam to be a much more significant battle than Gettysburg. His views on Abraham Lincoln are also surprising, in his view that President Lincoln was venerated in great part due to his death, and being the leader of the winning side.    Cooke also spends much more writing space on Woodrow Wilson, whom he clearly admires for his domestic and foreign policies,  but either ignores or just wasn't aware of Wilson's Racist policies. By contrast, Theodore Roosevelt, whose Presidency bridged the gap between the Civil War years and America becoming a major power, gets barely two pages.    Cooke's chapter on the \\"Arsenal of Democracy\\" is a revelatory look at how America's policy of \\"Lend Lease\\" and our subsequent entry into World War II did save the world from Hitlerism, especially when France had fallen and Britain was on the ropes.    Despite some of his views, or perhaps because of them - This well-written and profusely illustrated book deserves the five-star review because Alistair Cooke wrote a history that belongs on every thoughtful American's bookshelf alongside Stephen Ambrose's \\"To America\\". The things we take for granted about how great this country is were never missed by this great British writer.	2005-10-09

Howard Rheingold has excellent credentials to write this book through his long involvement at Wired magazine. He blends an effervescent interest in smart new gadgetry (point your phone-cam at some foreign signwriting and have it translated into your own language) with a thirsty desire to understand what it means to our society. To hunt down the story he structures the narrative in a breathtaking first-person style that takes us from Shibuya Station in Tokyo to the wireless capital of the world, Helsinki, and then back across the Atlantic to Bell Laboratories - and beyond.<br /><br />Clearly our society has been undergoing massive underlying change since the advent of the internet and mobile phones - but few writers have really grappled with the wider implications. If, as McLuhan said, the Medium is the Message then wireless technology provides a medium that totally re-engineers the way people can interact with their physical and social environment.<br /><br />Rheingold calls on dramatic examples of how individuals, wireless and mobile, can outwit the top down forces of the establishment - for example in the World Trade protests at Seattle, and political protests in the Philippines. He uses these as a metaphor for how the top-down 20th Century style organisations, political, industrial or media are increasingly out of step in the mobile age. Rheingold looks to young urban people - urban tribes if you like - as a bellwether to tomorrow's society.<br /><br />I loved this book. The writing is sharp, the insights deep and Rheingold's ability to take us into the labs of tomorrow a real treat. I strongly recommend it.	2005-10-09

I still don't really understand Jeffrey but I can now see why this series is so popular.<br /><br />Kathryn Windham is an excellent storyteller and I very much enjoyed most of the stories in this book. This book contains accounts from all over the Volunteer State so if you happen to be a native of Tennessee you will probably be familiar with at least a few of these ghosts. Being a long time fan of ghost books, many of the stories that the author relates in this book are indeed very familiar to me but considering the original date of publication this is probably one of the earliest books to relate these tales.<br /><br />Many of the stories included contain chilling accounts of eerie experiences that the author collected from the people who actually experienced an encounter with the ghost in question. One of these witnesses is actually related to me in a distant sort of way and this eyewitness documentation is always a great plus for a book of this nature. On the other hand, the author couldn't resist including a few old legends that can't be documented and have very little to do with ghosts in the first place. She also couldn't seem to resist using one chapter that she had already published in another book which is an irritating form of double-dipping that causes the reader to pay for the same story twice.<br /><br />Still, most of the stories were quite interesting and I very much enjoyed the author's storytelling skill. If the author had replaced a couple of the old legends with some stories of modern haunts this would have been a superb ghost book. Even with some disappointing stories this is a very good book and I may just have to be on the lookout for the other books in the Jeffrey series.	2005-10-09

It is a big, fat novel I hoped to lose myself in.<br /><br />However, I was disappointed. Perhaps THROUGH WOLF'S EYES would have been better if a good editor had cut this down considerably. I found that thr book slowed down considerably about halfway through. The intrigue, once Firekeeper arrives at court, just seemed ponderous to me. It was not badly written, but the book kept getting left on my bedside table while I went to find something more engaging to read. The intrigue in THROUGH WOLF'S EYES just did not have the page-turning quality required when the plot and cast get so large and convoluted.<br /><br />Perhaps I should try the novel again sometime, and I may do so. There was enough promise in THROUGH WOLF'S EYES that I will almost certainly try another book by Lindskold.	2005-10-09

Nietzsche was raised by his mother, grandmother and aunts; later in his life, his sister would become executor of his estate (after Nietzsche had become incapable of managing his own affairs) and reshape his philosophy and writings in her own idea - this becomes a running motif in later anthologies of Nietzsche; editors can quote and clip to fit their own agendas. In some ways, that is true of Kaufmann's text here, but in much less inappropriate ways than others, particularly Nietzsche's first editor, his sister.<br /><br />Nietzsche was a star pupil from his earliest days at university in Bonn and Leipzig. His formal study was in classical philology, but his attentions turned in various directions quickly during his writing and professional life - he had an intense interest in drama and the arts, with Wagner's music and Greek drama in principal interest. His first book was devoted to these topics - 'The Birth of Tragedy'. It was not highly regarded at the time, but has since become much more appreciated as an anticipation of later developments in philosophy and aesthetics.<br /><br />Nietzsche's life after this period was a very choppy one - he left the university, claiming illness, and while this developed later to be a true situation, at the time is was probably academic politics and difficulties fitting in with the establishment he was trying to break. He had a formal falling-out with Wagner, even writing later a piece entitled ' Nietzsche contra Wagner', finished just a few week prior to his going insane.<br /><br />Kaufmann states in the introduction that Nietzsche's real career took off after his active life was over; under his sister's direction, many of the writings Nietzsche had managed to do and not get published, or which were published but forgotten, really took off in major directions. While his major works of Zarathustra, Ecce Homo, Will to Power and Genealogy of Morals were in various editions of disrepair (indeed, the Will to Power was never more complete than a series of notes), Nietzsche had a knack for language that made him very quotable, and his influence continued to grow well into the first half of the twentieth century, influencing art, philosophy, history, and politics in dramatic ways, if not always the ways in which Nietzsche envisioned.<br /><br />For example, Nietzsche was not particularly impressed with the 'typical' German anti-semitism, which later erupted into the Nazi movement. He considered it rather bourgeois, and while he undoubted had his own issues with Jews (Nietzsche had issues with almost everyone, particularly any group, Christians included, who had a religious connection), the Nazi use of Nietzsche's work owes more to Nietzsche's sister's influence than anyone else.<br /><br />Kaufmann states that 'Genealogy of Morals' is perhaps the closest in form to English-speaking philosophical discourse.  This is a discussion that involves philosophy, psychology and linguistic theory, looking at morality in three different essays.  The first essay explores the idea of good and evil as good and bad; Nietzsche develops the idea of master and slave morality - the slave resists the ideas of the master, and thus values  things that are less likely to gain power - Nietzsche sees Christianity as an example of slave morality.<br /><br />The second essay looks at the issues of conscience and guilt, and how these spawned the invention of gods.  The third essay concludesthe work with a look at ascetic ideas, how these relate to aesthetic ideas, and where in Nietzsche's opinion the great philosophers of the past have gone wrong.<br /><br />Perhaps this later explains the second work in this collection, Ecce Homo.  In this book (first published posthumously), Nietzsche analyses his own work piece by piece, as well as gives an overall assessment of his life.  Nietzsche's insights into his own writings in hindsight is fascinating to behold.  For example, his idea of his work in the first piece of this collection, the Genealogy, is as follows:<br /><br />'Regarding expression, intention, and the art of suprise, the three inquiries which constitute this Genealogy are perhaps uncannier than anything else written so far.  Dionysus is, as is known, also the god of darkness.'<br /><br />Nietzsce is not easy reading, and this work is not the best for casual reading or the first-time reader of Nietzsche.  However, for those who have already made some headway into understanding him, this is a good collection, for Kaufmann is one of the better translators and commentators.  Kaufmann's notes here are especially valuable.late to aesthetic ideas, and where in Nietzsche's opinion the great philosophers of the past have gone wrong.

Books	4	10	10	N	N	OK book , nice quizzes	I'm a pharmacy student. This book is a required text for one of my classes. I have a strong background in anatomical and medical terminology. This book is very good for somebody, who is completely new to medical terminology. Even though the book itself does not help you very much, the quizes that come with accompanying CD are excellent. While you do the quizes you can check some words at the dictionary which is an integral part of the program. By doing the quizes for each chapter a few times, you can learn medical terminology.	2005-10-09

Rowling's phenomenal Harry Potter series is an effortlessly magical, charming, exciting, and completely immersive experience. It is incredibly rare to be as drawn into the world of a fantasy novel as much as one is in the terrifying, hilarious, and sometimes unsettling world that Rowling has created.<br /><br />Another commendation on Rowling's behalf is that she manages to make real, believable, and complex characters with strengths and weaknesses in equal measure. Eight years after the book's initial publication in the UK, sitting down to read this book is like having a cup of tea with old friends. It's a beautiful novel, it really is.<br /><br />How interesting that both the Harry Potter and Buffy the Vampire Slayer series started in 1997, each revitalizing the fantasy genre and creating some of the most realistic and complicated characters in the genre's history. 'Twas a good year for make-believe.	2005-10-09

Unlike David Griffiths' QM book, this one contains lots of relevant worked out examples and problems. Zettili also displays the theory in an open and honest way, i.e. no hiding. <br /> <br />There's a wealth of information in this book, so as always when studying a book, you should focus on only those topics that are relevant to your course. Otherwise you might get lost and waste time on straying. <br /> <br />If you find a topic of interest to you, e.g. Clebsch-Gordan coefficients (for addition of angular momenta), then you will face plenty of equations that may look frightening at first, but after struggling with those for a few hours, the payoff is absolutely fulfilling! Griffiths won't give you those Heureka-moments, but Zettili will give you the mental feedback you secretly desire to motivate why you're studying such a difficult subject like QM! <br /> <br />I'm reviewing this QM book from a mathematical point of view, so if you're looking for a more conceptual QM book, then I recommend Feynman's books. <br /> <br />If you haven't studied QM before, then I recommend McQuarrie's Physical Chemistry book. The first 8 chapters of that book will give you an easy and relevant tour of essential calculations in QM for beginners. I also recommend McQuarrie's Mathematical methods book, since it contains a section on the Gamma function, which I believe is crucial to be able to do calculations in QM. <br /> <br />Zettili's book displays QM with Dirac's Bra-c-ket notation, which is Zuper great tool to do integrals. It looks difficult at first, but you'll be in pain if avoid it! <br /> <br />The problem with Griffith's QM book is that you only get half the book for the full price, the other half is included in the Instuctor's solutions manual. That way you feel very cut off several times in every chapter and there's no flow in the book. In Zettili's book you get a Zuper complete set of theory and solutions, which is great for reference! Zettili will show you how it's done through multiple solved examples and solved problems , and after that you're so full of joy that you'll happily do the extra problems (with no answers) in the end of each chapter!  <br /> <br />If you only have money for one of these 2 books, then I thoroughly recommend Zettili's QM book. But if you're a newbie to QM, have a look at McQuarrie's Physical Chemistry book, it also has a student solutions manual sold separately, with ALL solutions. <br /> <br />Sure, there are typos in Zettili's book. But are these really an obstacle for learning QM? No! It's just gratifying to be able to correct the author.  <br /> <br />The math needed for doing the problems in this book, is mainly Calculus and Linear Algebra, but since there are so many new concepts from Mathematical methods in this book I recommend owning a Mathematical methods book. This is not beacuse new math stuff like Legendre polynomials and Spherical harmonics, etc. offer new math. They don't! They're simply strange names that use Calculus in their calculations! But you might start wondering what they are and therefore forget to learn QM which you shouldn't, so this is why I recommend a Math methods book. <br /> <br />Don't forget that physics and mathematics is just lots of simple things, with emphasis on LOTS! This is why it's so \\"difficult\\", it's difficult to comprehend. <br /> <br />If you're seriously studying QM for your Master's degree, then you will face almost all the topics within Zettili's book. So you cannot avoid the difficult math in serious QM, because QM IS difficult math! <br /> <br />And Zettili's QM book is one of the best books for undergraduate physics students.	2005-10-09

This is the French text edition of a book that I had originally thought was going to be a work of non-fiction in a nanny tell all. It turned out, instead, to be a mildly funny look at the rich and obnoxious and their young children through the eyes of a spineless nanny. While some of this book is amusing, it is not particularly well written. It is the kind of book you read once, and then promptly forget. It is not a bad book, as it is somewhat entertaining. What this book really represents is what happens when a book grabs the attention of the media. It becomes a best seller. Long after the dust settles, I anticipate that this book will be to the publishing world, what a one hit wonder is to the music industry.<br /><br />This work of fiction provides caricatures of selfish, self-absorbed, wealthy parents and a peek into the life of their overly-structured and overly-managed offspring. The nanny in question is also a caricature, as she struggles to be appear good hearted, but in the end is just a spineless jellyfish who goes along with the program, no matter how offensive she may find her employers and their demands to be. The nanny tries to come across as an underprivileged, put upon employee, but is, in reality, part of the problem, as she is certainly not a part of the solution. She is an upper middle class young woman who attends a prestigious university. She is hardly one of the hoi polloi, no matter how much she may empathize with those who are truly at the mercy of employers such as the ones found in this book. As social satire this book falls short. Borrow it from the library. Do not bother to buy it, as it is a one note book. If you feel that you must buy it, do yourself a favor and buy the paperback, as it is not a book that you would want to keep. It is a quick, throwaway read.	2005-10-09

Hey, you've probably spent several hundred dollars on a nice camera....and here's a guide that tell you actually how to use that same camera to take better shots.<br /><br />2) There are a series of practice lessons that guide you through the best vantage points, the best focal points, even the best time to take photos - whether landscape, portraits or floral shots. Mr. Davis not only helps you set up a shot with this guide, but he'll tell you what the best exposure would be for the shot itself.  Now that's helpful when you're out in the field trying to figure out how to capture nature better than through a simple snapshot.<br /><br />3) Mr. Davis also covers what I would call targeting learning.  He takes a subject (sunsets or water for example) and tells the reader the best settings that will produce the best outcome.  He also talks about variations on themes, and I found those chapters to be compelling reading.<br /><br />4)  Finally, this volume has a whole section on editing and improving photos after the shot.  Again, it is in an easy to read - and easy to use - format that explains the concepts and usage without complicating things.<br /><br />In essence, this book is about two things.  Speed of use and speed of improvement.  If you want to know how to use your camera to take better photos....and you want to know how to do it without reading dozens of pages about arcane photographic terms, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />This book is one you'll use over and over in your photographic journey.<br /><br />Highly recommended.w how to do it without reading dozens of pages about arcane photographic terms, then this is the book for you. <br /> <br />This book is one you'll use over and over in your photographic journey. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.	2005-10-09

The retro, pulpy cover leads us into a classic Tom of Finland encounter followed by one of the psudonymous 'Stephen's'  more edgy and disturbing contributions, \\"Kidnapped\\", the story of an abducted young businessman who learns to love his imprisonment and abuse.   Greg Garcia's \\"Pivot Point\\", about the stage in a relationship where the balance of power shifts, is a little flowery but intriguing, and \\"Sky-High and Hard\\" by 'Sean', features the usual cast of amiable cuddly boneheads getting 'em off and getting it on in an unusual setting, this time on a window-washer's platform.  The popularity of 'The Hun's' barely-legible \\"Big Sig\\" continues to elude me, as does the appeal of 'Mike's' curiously distorted artwork, but in general the standard of the 'serious' strips this time is quite high. Amongst the comedy, Jeff Krell's \\"Jayson\\" stands out with its superior bitchy wit, and Donelan's contributions are frothy fun. Sean Martin's cartoons are amiable domestic sitcom, and Kurt Erichsen's \\"Murphy's Manor\\" is sly and blatant all at once. A.Jay's \\"Harry Chess\\" occupies a unique niche all to itself; it's historically significant. Important, even. But it's sadly not actually very good, and has dated badly.  The remainder of the book is taken up by contributions by myself, under the name of Howard Stangroom, and my collaborator Stephen Lowther; \\"Can We Do It Till I Need Glasses?\\" is a true-life European odyssey, and \\"Midnight Confessions\\", the story of a man and wife who discover they have more tastes in common than they thought, remains one of the more popular shorts we've done - particularly among women who've read it, though what that states about their marriages I hesitate to guess!  Most of the Stangroom & Lowther material is now collected in full-colour, rather than Meatmen's black & white, in the \\"Prime Cuts\\" paperback from Germany's Bruno Gmunder (also available on Amazon!), but the rest of the book is a strong lineup, and a good sampler of the quality of the first half of the series.	2005-10-09

The premise of this book is that women should always monitor a man's actions to determine whether he is into her or not. Most likely, he is not. Why is it the woman's responsibility to figure out what his sweet nothings coupled with his absent-minded behavior translate into?  I've got a great idea - maybe men should be the ones to read a NY Times Best Seller on how not to say things they don't mean. I'll get you started on a few chapters:<br /><br />1. You were born with a pair of balls, use them!<br />2. If you're not attracted to her, don't ask for her number<br />3. If you like a girl, let her know.<br />4. If you don't like a girl, let her know.<br />5. If you want to marry her, let her know.<br />6. If you don't want to marry her, move out immediately to avoid common law penalties<br />7. Cheating is for cowards. Are you a coward?<br />8. Take our handy quiz to find out if you are a coward!<br />9. If you are an alcoholic, girls will not like you<br />10. If you abuse drugs, you are an even bigger loser<br /><br />If you need to buy a book to make yourself feel sexy and wanted, you're better off putting that $14.05 towards a new haircut than this cheesy little book.	2005-10-09

I do, however, know a bad book when I read one.   <br />    The liner notes state that Palahniuk draws on the tradition of Chaucer, Mary Shelley and others.  Don't buy the hype.  Palahniuk has written this story with short-sighted abandon. All of the characters speak in the same voice.  All of the short stories, narration, and poems are written in the voice of the narrator/participant, who speaks in the most heavy-handed, unrealistic tone.   <br />    What is supposed to be a surreal critique of American society is nothing more than a base realization of the author's childish grosseties; a self-indulgent, unchecked plunge into an absurd, dark, yet tastelessly monolithic place. <br />    Palahniuk takes no stock in the psychology of actual people.  His characters are no deeper than the paper they are printed on, and their actions and stories are contrived.  His characters offer no insight into anything relevant, and the narrator's voice is forced and flimsy.  WHERE IS THE EDITOR!?!?	2005-10-09

WPF (Avalon) is a huge platform, and you can easily get lost with all the classes and their uses without a good guide and lots of examples.  This book provides both.  If you are just learning Avalon, the book will focus you on what is important and put things into a context where you can start work immediately.  But even if you have already \\"learned\\" the platform, this book makes a great reference for those parts of the API you don't hit every day. <br /> <br />In my review feedback to O'Reilly I summarized it thus:  \\"Avalon is such a large complex platform, I long worried that people would find it hard or impossible to learn it.  Chris and Ian have written a book that can get anyone up to speed rapidly, while not glossing over topics or leaving out essential technical details.\\"   <br /> <br />My favorite chapter is on data-binding.  This is possibly the most powerful and innovative feature of WPF, and Chris tells a great story that explains both the how and the why of the technology.  The weakest chapter is graphics (sorry, Ian).  Graphics is approximately half the Avalon platform, and could easily make up a book in itself...one chapter is simply insufficient, though Ian still manages to get one started, and he has promised me the section will be expanded for the version that covers the final shipping Avalon.	2005-10-09

I loved \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" and I definitely consider it as a pinnacle of the unfortunately biased titled genre \\"womens literature\\". Mabye thats why I found Weisberger's newest novel, \\"Everyone Worth Knowing\\" dissapointing at best. If you dont mind recycled characters or tired and predictable plotlines this book might be acceptable. The main character literally began and ended the novel sitting on her couch. Character development, bah, who needs it! At least the cartoonish co-workers caused a lot of intersting plot-development. Oh wait, no . . . they didnt. I kept reading hoping for some smashingly good confrontation but it never happened. At least Weisberger included the requisite older, sassy mentor, this time embodied by an aging gay uncle rather than the usual bohemian grandmother we normally see in this genre.

There is none of the typical cynicism that characterizes most personal accounts of the war in Iraq nor is there any glorification of violence often seen in other military memoirs.  Instead the book is the account of a normal guy's actions and reactions in combat.  Fick is not the stereotypical alpha-male warrior, but rather an introspective individual whose ability to lead made him a successful commander.  The reader feels Fick's horror at the tragedies of war, his exhilaration after successful missions, and his disgust when confronted with incompetence from his seniors.  The result is a very believeable personal account of the war.  It would have been nice to read Fick's analysis of the prosecution of the invasion and occupation of Iraq, but it is critical to realize that such anlaysis was not his goal. Fick did not intend to criticise or support the war nor did he intend to criticise the strategic decisions of senior commanders.  Instead he sought to write about his experiences and his feelings about them. In this he has done a superb job.	2005-10-09

But its heyday was the twenty years either side of 1900 -- the high Victorian and Edwardian eras and on through the Great War -- in which every post office and village shop in the country, it seemed, carried his images of local sights for sale to tourists. Frith's photos are still very popular among collectors and local historians, for he and his assistants set out to record every single view of interest in the whole of England. The huge collection of images the company left behind were well on the way to uncaring destruction when a group of collectors were able to get hold of the surviving items -- \\"merely\\" 60,000 original glass plates and a quarter-million prints, now the basis of an unparalleled visual museum of the lives, work, and social mores of the English people over several generations. Ziegler has contributed the text for this collection of some 650 historical photos, which are accompanied by several hundred recent photos of the same views by John Cleare. For the student of modern social history, the result is fascinating, especially when a series of photos of, say, a seaside resort captures visitors from the 1890s, 1920s, 1950s, and late 1990s; in some cases, the clothing styles are the only significant change. Ziegler is generally quite able at providing context and historical discussion -- where the hedgerows went, the difference in status between the topper and the bowler. My only real complaint in that regard is that the captions of the photos much too frequently simply repeat a sentence or two from the text on the same page; under proper editorial guidance, this would have been an opportunity to slip in an additional remark or observation without adding to the book's length.	2005-10-09

I bought this book for my 9 year old daughter.  We read a little bit together, and then I skimmed the book, and she read a bunch on her own.  The book is well written for girls in the 9-11 age range - I wouldn't go much below the age of 9, however, without being very selective of what the child reads (there is a brief discussion, for example, about masturbation and orgasm, which I think is a bit *too* much for a book of this level).  All in all, I think it explained the changes of puberty in very plain language that a young girl can understand, and it's set up in a way that encourages discussion - although again, sometimes it suggests discussing things with friends, which I find to be a poor recommendation considering the age and topic.  I do think my daughter came away with a solid understanding of what puberty is and what physical changes are going to take place.	2005-10-09

A novel about adventure, love and betrayal set in the fantasy world of Alagasia.  The story revolves around Eragon, Roran and Nasuada, three main viewpoints whose fates are intertwined in the quest to free the land from King Galbatorix's tyrannical rule.  The return of the Dragon Riders and dynamic relationships make this a story of epic proportions.  Recommended for ages 13 and up due to upper-level vocabulary and some violence. <br /> <br />This reading is definitely something to get hooked on.  Even though it's a fantasy book, there are underlying themes that anyone can relate to.  The importance of friends and family is one.  Eragon grew up not knowing a mother or father, but living with his uncle and cousin.  When his uncle died, he had to abandon his home to keep his town out of danger.  The only \\"family\\" he really has left is his dragon, which he loves dearly.  Unrequited love is another theme that links this story to reality.  Eragon falls in love with the elf Arya, but because of their obligations and the vast differences between them, Arya realizes and believes that his love for her cannot be.  The imagery that Paolini incorporates into this novel made me feel as if I could touch and encounter what he was describing.  He made his world beautiful and enchanting.  While I was reading Eldest, I was living out Eragon's quest.  The way Paolini writes the novel is what makes the story so engaging.  He has certain vocabulary and pronunciations particular to the world of Alagasia and the races of people living within it, reminiscent of the Elvin writing incorporated into The Lord of the Rings.  This allows the novel to become more involved and interactive. There is also a strong plot that allows this story to seem tangible and not far-fetched, as well as a great twist at the end that left me begging to read more, which is perfect since this is the second book in a trilogy.  Paolini's passion for fantasy and writing is definitely evident in his work, and I wouldrecommend this series to anyone with a love for fantasy novels. <br />	2005-10-09

Theirs was an unabashedly commercial venture, and the artists collaborated to create and sell works as quickly and cheaply as possible.  Dismissed as \\"motel art\\" at the time, these intense, lush and at times otherworldly depictions of an idealized Florida have become a subject of renewed interest and critical attention in recent years.  Consequently, many myths and vague tales have grown up around the group. <br /> <br />As part of his research, author Gary Monroe interviewed many of the remaining artists to bring the story to life, presented here in a 26-page annotated essay.   In analyzing the art, he insists that the speed with which they worked was far from a detriment: \\"By unintentionally bastardizing the canonical pictorial strategies...they created a new form of fantasy landscape painting.\\"   The artists found their strength as colorists, and the emotional hues capture the essence of Florida (or at least, as we imagine it.)  <br /> <br />As a northerner who visited Florida twice as a child in the pre-Disney days, I must confess that the 63 glorious full-color reproductions here gave me goose bumps of fond memory, real or imagined.  <br /> <br />A followup: This book launched an explosion of interest in The Highwaymen. Surviving members no longer need hawk their wares, since collectors now come to them and new works sell for as much as $18,000. The were inducted into the Florida Artists Hall of Fame in 2004.	2005-10-09

We were delighted to see this second entry in the Jane Bauer series about a NYPD Detective and her two sidekicks that specialize on cold cases.  As the author's ex-nun Chris Bennett series seems to sputter a little, this new character is a welcome change from Lee Harris; one that features a somewhat grittier storyline and less family machinations than the \\"holiday\\" set.  As with other reviewers, though, we do agree that Jane's ten-year affair with a married man (Hack) seems out of character, and a rather unwelcome twist to what we presume to be the author's values on such matters...<br /><br />In the fine storyline, a mentally troubled man (Stratton) is dead from apparent self-starvation.  His prominent sister, with connections high up in the NYPD, wants the case re-opened eight years later, as she never accepted it as a suicide.  When Jane and partners Defino and MacHovec start interviewing people and chasing now-distant clues, a suicide of the man's case worker is discovered, which seems way too coincidental to the cops.  Eventually that latter death is ruled a murder, and that case is reopened as well.  Most of the book then actually pursues that crime and its real circumstances, outcome, and perpetrators to a somewhat surprising conclusion that significantly endangers Bauer.  Possibly the only dissatisfaction to the novel is the somewhat unresolved status of Stratton's death.<br /><br />We seem to enjoy Harris' mysteries and feel she is on the right track to promote Bauer's exploits and maybe let the other series fade away.  If she can dream up further interesting cases and maybe fix Bauer's love life while she's at it, we predict she can pump out another dozen or so stories in this set!  Not bad for an author with some forty books (under various names) already under her belt!	2005-10-09

This is a amazing book that keeps you on your toes throughout the inter thing.  Set in medieval times it this novel cleverly alternates narration between the Dragon rider Eragon and his stepbrother Roan.  These two Characters go thorough many trials and tribulations only to find the thing they most desire may be further away then they even realize.  This is great reading for anyone one, but might be difficult for children under 12 because of the length and some difficult vocabulary. <br /> <br />This book could be considered a relaxing read.  For those with a fairly good vocabulary it should hold no great challenges, all one has to do is sit back and let themselves be absorbed into the story.  Paolini is very clever with his use of characterization and diction, easily drawing you into the personalities of each character.  Eragon is characterized as a strong mined, pupil who still has much to learn but is slowly proving himself in the world.  He is constantly given new challenges and each one he continues to overcome.  Then you look at Roan the stepbrother who is constantly thinking about revenge.  So many things have happened to him throughout his life that the thought of avenging people is always in his mind.  Christopher is also grate at the use of diction thorough his characters.  He has cleverly made up words in different languages, like the dwarfven language and the elves that speak in the ancient language.  It really peaks the reader's interest when all of a sudden people are no longer conversing in an everyday manner. Another way in which Paolini makes his books such wonderful reads is his grate use of suspense, which always keep the reader on the edge.  He always brings you to a high point and just when everything appears to have settled down he brings the suspense right back up.  Christopher's ability to portray characterization, diction, and his ability to build suspense are just some of the things that contribute to making his book Eldest such a wonderfulnovel to read.  <br />	2005-10-09

Hallem and Wignell present a very detailed analysis of mass extinction.  Unfortunately, it is too detailed for me.  [But see my later notes, below, for more about that.]  I've never studied geology and there was much more detail than I could absorb.  Also, the times are given in stages, not periods.  \\"Late Devonian\\" I understand, but not \\"Frasnian-Famennian\\".<br /><br />But I did gain some insight into the relationship between geology and life, and I expect to read it again and gain more.  Before I do that, I will make a chart of geologic time and, as I read the first chapters, I will write notes.  If you're not an evolutionary scientist and you decide to read this book, I recommend you do the same.<br /><br />It starts out with a discussion of how one recognizes a mass extinction.  For example, a decline in the numbers of fossils might just indicate that conditions for fossilization were less favorable, or it could accurately reflect a decline in numbers of species.  The authors explain some ways to distinguish the two cases and settle on five periods which they consider to be real mass extinctions.<br /><br />Then there is a discussion of the tools used to search for possible causes of extinction.  For example, a change in the ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12 can indicate a decline in the amount of oxygen available for life.  Or a change in sea level can lead to a rise in oxygen level.  It will help you to make notes of anything in this section with which you are not already familiar.<br /><br />Finally, the book goes through each of the five major extinctions and examines each in terms of the tools.  This is the bulk and payoff of the book.<br /><br />I was disappointed by one thing: there's not as much material as I would like on the aftermath mentioned in the title.  I am very interested in this because I believe that, after a mass extinction clears away most animals, there is plenty of opportunity for new forms to evolve.<br /><br />There are quite a number of questions left unanswered and disputes unsettled.  This may be frustrating to some readers, but it is inevitable in a book on current science.  Creationists will call these \\"gaps\\"; Ph.D.s will call them job opportunities and many readers will think of them as \\"to be continued\\".<br /><br />[Original review 9 Oct 2005; this paragraph 22 June 2006]  If this book sounds too technical for you, you might want to read the book Extinction: How Life on Earth Nearly Ended 250 Million Years Ago, by Douglas H. Erwin.  (Click on \\"See all my reviews\\" for a review.)  It's rather elementary, and it covers only the Permian extinction, but it has a lot of information.  Furthermore, Erwin gradually introduces technical matters at a rate that many non-scientists can absorb.  By the time you finish Erwin, you might want to read Hallam and Wignall.<br /><br />[Added 4 July 2006]  I have just finished reading this book for the second time.  With the knowledge gained from the first reading, and with what I learned from Erwin's book, I found it much more readable.  With my \\"jargon anxiety\\" greatly reduced, I was able to follow much of the remaining jargon with the help of charts in this book.  [For example, \\"Frasnian\\" and \\"Fammenian\\" are now entirely familiar to me.] Hallam and Wignall is aimed at advanced students, and there is much that I will probably never follow, especially regarding categories of marine invertebrates.  But, not being a scientist, I don't need all of that.  (E.g., I don't need to know the difference between rugose and scleractinian corals.  The important thing is that one type went extinct at the end of the Permian and that the other eventually took over.)  It's a great book for an interested non-scientist who likes to work at learning.<br /><br />And, yes, I did make some notes about the early material and I referred back to them often as I read.<br /><br />Regarding my disappointment over the shortage of material on recovery: on further consideration, what I really missed was material on how our mammal-like ancestors managed to squeeze through the Permian extinction.  Thanks to both H & W and Erwin, I realize that evidence for this is just about non-existent.h the Permian extinction.

US	36195190	RPY7HZ5AVTT3I	0374281580	481407616	I Am Charlotte Simmons: A Novel	Books	2	13	16	N	N	Not quite the right stuff	Tom Wolfe is best at exploring some cultural niche of American life. He is much less good as a pure novelist and characterization, except as it serves his primary goal as a social anthropologist, is not his forte. I am not going to criticize the weak portrayal of his title character but rather his cultural observations since I believe they were off in this book, and this is what he should have delivered in order to provide a good \\"Tom Wolfe\\" book.      The first point is perhaps a quibble. The fictional university, Dupont, has an average SAT score of 1490. I think that only a small number of universities would qualify, including: Harvard; Yale; Princeton; MIT; Cal Tech and possibly Stanford. The novel wants to make a point about the athlete class and how divorced their lives (and academic abilities) are from the putative mission of these selective colleges to educate the best and brightest. Of the colleges that would qualify for this elite level academically I believe only Stanford even offers athletic scholarships, and the athletes are relatively screened academically.      It is almost certainly true that most major universities have a class of \\"student-athletes\\" who are admitted and kept in school without any requirement that they perform academically at the level expected of an average student but it is specious and disingenuous to juxtapose this problem with a student body this highly selected. It winds up reading more like farce than an incisive observation of part of the current scene in American higher education (and this is the type of situation where Wolfe, with aspirations as a novelist, betrays Wolfe the social observer-you have to have it one way or the other- either it is a valid social observation or it is \\"literary\\" license.)     The second problem is more significant, especially for one paid big bucks for spotting trends in American life. In order to make this point it is important to understand one of the major currents in the book. Sex iseverywhere and women are as much the buyers as the sellers. This is probably true but Wolfe somehow seems to have missed the important issue behind this observation. The women (female students) seem to be anachronisms from the fifties or sixties. The author's implied view of intersex relationships appears frozen in amber from a previous time. The implication, to me anyway, is that Wolfe's women, in submitting to sex, are viewed by him as disadvantaged and objectified. In an era when women were economically and socially obligated to men this status relationship was true but the mothers of these women, when they entered college, would never have believed the demographic changes that would alter their daughters' lives and outlooks. Women now make up about 60% of entering undergraduate classes at universities; they comprise nearly 50% of admitted classes to professional schools. This is a revolutionary change in such a short period.     The result is that today's college woman is empowered economically, socially and sexually in the same way men are. She is independent of men and views herself so. Women are no longer exclusively sexual objects but also function as sexual objectifiers. Sex, rather than a romantic goal and conclusion to the war between the sexes- the ultimate prize to bestow and the power that women hold over otherwise more powerful men, has become simply one more commodity to be bartered between equals. These women have no intention of marrying in or right after college and they have every intention of enjoying themselves socially as much as men. They are as likely to be the victimizers in a sexual exchange as they are to be its victim.     Wolfe shows his age in his quaint and chivalrous view of women and this is not surprising given the rapidity of the change. The problem is it is his job to identify this kind of cultural change and he didn't deliver.	2005-10-09

Books	4	16	16	N	N	Elvis and Lucy  - does anyone know the whole truth?	<br /> <br />Lucy's life was filled with fear, doubt and terror.  Losing her father so abruptly at age 3 and going from being well off to homeless in a few short days, this was a great shock and trauma for such a young child.  Added to this, a very cruel grandmother forced her at age 11, to marry a much older man, who was an alcoholic, rapist and child abuser. <br /> <br />Lucy had her first baby at age 12 and by age 17 she had 3 children. She wanted to keep people from finding out the age she was when she was married, and the ages of her children.  Because she felt these were dark things, things to be deeply ashamed of.  To her young, traumatized mind, she felt she had a dark past, when in fact, she was innocent and needed the world of help, and the darkness was done to her by others. <br /> <br />As a result of feeling such deep shame and feeling she was responsible for the dark things that were done to her, she lived her life in great fear, always guarded, and felt she had to be as secretive as possible.  At her age and at that time she did not feel secure enough to let people find out.  She thought she would be judged and condemned and thought of as \\"not good enough\\".  This is very unfortunate.  I don't know what the people of that era would have said or done.  I am certain in this era she would be seen as an innocent, abused child. <br /> <br />It is with this state of mind that Lucy lived her life.  It is possible she was able to keep secrets very well because of her extreme fear. <br /> <br />She said she met Elvis when she was 16 and he was 18.  That was the year Elvis graduated from high school - 1953.  She said they were in love and he wanted to marry her, that they did take their vows in the presence of God.  He called her Desiree, which in French means desired one.  According to Lucy, she didn't see how it could work out because she realized that Elvis was headed for success and would be in the public eye.  This was the only man she ever loved and she didn't want her \\"dark past\\" to be revealed because it would hurt his success.  She encouraged him to pursue his career because she knew how much it meant to him.  She ran away so he could feel free to meet others and go on with his life without her. <br /> <br />In 1954 he was dating Dixie and he was her graduation date.  They were seeing each other but his career was taking off and they started growing apart because Elvis was on the road most of the time.  They went their different ways.  Dixie met someone and got married. <br /> <br />Elvis searched for Lucy and found her in 1955.  He still wanted to marry her.  She still couldn't see how things could work out for them, he was more famous than ever.  She ran away again in 1957 - she was pregnant with her daughter who she named Desiree.  She was afraid to tell Elvis about the child, because he would own her publicly.  She was terrified of what the press would do not only to Desiree but to her other children, also herself and Elvis's career.  This was the main reason everything was kept so secret.  <br /> <br />The book goes on about what happened as the years went by. <br /> <br />A lot of people doubt how truthful Lucy is.  The following could be food for thought. <br /> <br />Elvis knew how to ride a horse at that time.  The Memphis zoo rented them.   <br /> <br />Lucy has green eyes and in her book, Elvis said 'if they had a little girl she would be precious and have green eyes and say really! actually! like Lucy.'   <br /> <br />O'Grady, who had a career in the police force later went to do security work for Elvis.  He knows that the name \\"Desiree\\" was on the list of calls that must be accepted for Elvis at all times. <br /> <br />Elvis made arrangements with Lucy to meet him in Washington.  Everyone in his entourage knew he travelled there alone.  They had no idea why.  After he spent time with Lucy, he took a plane and went one way and Lucy took a plane and went a different way.  He did not go back to Graceland, he contacted Jerry Schilling and Red West to meet him and he went back to Washington, this time he met with President Nixon. <br /> <br />According to several accounts including Joe Esposito, after Priscilla went to live at Graceland, Elvis's feelings towards her changed.  He did not want to be married to her.  She began asking regularly when will they be married and he kept stalling by saying, when the time is right he would know.  She would then complain to her stepfather, Mr. Beaulieu, who would have it out with Tom Parker and Elvis's father, Vernon, and they in turn would put pressure on Elvis.  This went on for a while, Elvis refused to be married.  Mr. Beaulieu then threatened to sue Elvis.  Elvis still refused to be married.  Parker knew the situation was potentially explosive and talked Elvis into getting married.  Parker made all the arrangements and Elvis put up quite a front. <br /> <br />Priscilla and her relatives were recently on TV saying they were disappointed that they didn't have a chance to have their input in the wedding arrangements.  According to Lucy's book, Elvis (was married in May, 1967 and he) went to see Lucy in July 1967.  He was very upset that he was forced into the marriage.  Lucy did not want any physical intimacy with Elvis, they just talked. <br /> <br />Priscilla, in her movie and television appearances, said that in her seventh month of pregnancy, Elvis told her he wanted to have a separation.  Lucy said that when Priscilla was seven months pregnant, Elvis contacted her and wanted them to meet.  He was very upset and said he wanted to have a separation from Priscilla.  Lucy talked him out of it.  She said something like, Priscilla needed at that time and leaving at such a time would be bad and could hurt his career. <br /> <br />I have read that early in the marriage Elvis stopped having sexual relations with Priscilla.  After Lisa Marie was born and Priscilla was back to \\"normal\\", Elvis refused to have sexual relations with her.  It was in her television movie.  The explanation was that Elvis didn't want to have sex with women who had had a child.  That was only to reject Priscilla as softly as he could.  There could've been other reasons also, based on what I read in the book, \\"Child Bride\\". <br /> <br />There was no great love between Elvis and Priscilla.  According to one of Elvis's closest friends, Larry Geller, Elvis realized he loved Priscilla like a sister.  That explains a lot of why he behaved the way he did when he was with Priscilla. <br /> <br />Elvis had said several times he wanted to be married and have some children.  In order to \\"have some children\\" with his wife, he would have had to have sex with a woman who had a child. <br />  <br />And it goes on and still no one knows the whole truth. <br /> <br />I wonder what everyone would say if a DNA test proved that Desiree is Elvis's child.       <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

It is about Edith Irvine, a dedicated photographer, and her 15-year-old assistant Daisy. On their way to Europe, the earthquake hits and they have to stop in San Francisco, which is mostly destroyed and collapsing. After the quake, a great fire erupts and several of the city's houses and buildings they had not already fallen burn to the ground. The two are separated from Edith's father, who was traveling with them, and they become friends with a few other survivors. Meanwhile, the mayor is creating even more trouble. Men and women are threatened to being shot for using toilets or electricity, and dynamite, in an attempt to stop the fire, is being set off. But, Edith documents the trip with her photographs, even though that could mean death if she was caught by the mayor, who doesn't want the rest of the country to know the real disaster that is happening in San Francisco. In this incredibly realistic novel, Kristiana Gregory tells the exciting story, based on a letter written by survivor Mary Exa Atkin Campbell and the real photographs taken by Edith Irvine. I would highly recommend this book.	2005-10-09

Rene Descartes is often considered the founding father of modern philosophy.  A true Renaissance man, he studied Scholastic philosophy and physics as a student, spent time as a volunteer soldier and traveler throughout Europe, studied mathematics, appreciated the arts, and became a noted correspondent with royals and intellectual figures throughout the continent.  He died in Sweden while on assignment as tutor to the Queen, Christiana.<br /><br />Descartes 'Discourse on Method' is a fascinating text, combining the newly-invented form of essay (Descartes was familiar with the Essays of Montaigne) with the same kind of autobiographical impulse that underpins Augustine's Confessions.  Descartes writes about his own form of mystical experience, seeing this as almost a kind of revelation that all past knowledge would be superseded, and all problems would eventually be solved by human intellect.<br /><br />In the Discourse, Descartes formulates logical principles based on reason (which makes it somewhat ironic that this came to him almost as a revelation).  Descartes had some appreciation for thinkers such as Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes, but he thought that Bacon depended too much upon empirical data, and with Hobbes he disagreed on what would be the criteria for ascertaining certainty.<br /><br />Descartes was a mathematician at heart, and perhaps had a carry-over of Pythagorean mystical attachment to mathematics, for his sense of reason led him to impute an absolute quality to mathematics; this has major implications for metaphysics and epistemology.  Descartes method was a continuation in many ways of the ideas of Plato, Aristotle and the medieval thinkers, for they all tended toward thinking in absolute, universal terms in some degree.<br /><br />Descartes in his first section discounts much of Scholasticism, stating that the only real absolutes are theology and mathematics; because theology is based upon revelation, it is therefore beyond reason, and thus, mathematics becomes the only rational truth.  Descartes develops this idea further with rules of method, which include ideas of intuition, analysis and deduction.  He uses some of his method to come up with his greatest proposition:<br /><br />Cogito ergo sum  - -  I think, therefore I am<br /><br />'The Cogito is a first principle from which Descartes will now deduce all that follows.'  This permits Descartes to deal both with rational elements and empirical data.<br /><br />The other major piece in this collection, 'The Meditations', includes several different mediations, including that on the existence of the soul, the existence of God, the material world, things we may doubt, and other philosophical problems of the time.  These meditations do incorporate Descartes attempt to employ his method to some degree, but at the same time divert into other means.  For example, Descartes' meditation on the existence of God is in many ways the Anselm ontological proof revisited, and has a certain circular reasoning to it.<br /><br />This is an important text, one that I read the summer before I went to college, and makes a good study for those who wish to see the personal element in the development of philosophy.d thus, mathematics becomes the only rational truth.

This edition, however, is the ultimate.  The books are beautifully made, the strips are very nicely presented and carefully reproduced, the commentaries are just informative enough - and the index is always interesting.  (Only a fan, for example, would recognize the index's reference to \\"Msssp Msspe\\" - Schulz's coded name for one of Walt Disney's most famous characters.  A novice might see the entry, wonder what it meant, go to the strip in question - and see that the joke has not lost a bit of its relevance since it was created in the 1950s.)	2005-10-09

As a devout reader of The New Yorker I was anxiously awaiting access to their archives for a long time only to be sadly disappointed by this effort.  I have relished in the treasure chest of past articles from the other great publications with New York titles: The Times and the NYRB.  This release by Random House is simply an embarrassment, with the only explanation for this clumsy version I can imagine was a corporate demand for a pre-holiday rollout.  The two prominent faults are both so glaring and unnecessary in this moment of refined technology.  The search feature is abysmal, providing only dates for a given search but no elucidation to what the result refers to.  By far the greatest flaw is the actual reading format.  The display is basically microfilm on a disc with ads and all.  It is nearly impossible to read on my monitor and is useless if one wants to print the article.  How the creators of this collection could have released it without a printer friendly option stretches all credulity.  David Remnick who has done a fine job shepherding the magazine for the past decade should be particularly shamed by this shocking failure of product.  The New Yorker has set the pace for literary standards for decades, now falls unceremoniously on its face with this release.  The publishers should issue a mass recall and produce a useable archive.  This being doubtful, I will do all that is left for a jilted lover to do: return my sadly disappointing copy.	2005-10-09

Between her breasts she was shamefully emblazoned & tattooed as \\"Feld Hure\\" (field whore) with SN A135633.  The camp had both Labor & Joy Divisions where she was forced to watch \\"Public Chastisement\\" in Execution Square where 20 nude girls, strapped onto chairs, were bludgeoned to death upon order of Master (Mistress) Kalefactress, a criminal prison releasee overseer for Nazis.<br /><br />Daniella is transferred to Joy Division, sterilized & used as sex slave or Pleasure Maiden in the \\"Doll House\\" which holds 50 inmates. These girls are required to provide sex to Nazi soldiers before their departure to the Russian front.  During \\"Enjoyment Duty\\" they are instructed to smile and act happy - if not, & they accrue 3 bad reports, they are beaten & executed.  The 50 inmates are depicted as being arranged into 2 rows of 25 girls each, back to back, & awaiting the ingress of German Nazi soldiers who then arrive & assemble with agonizing fevor at distinctly 2:00 PM daily. Throughout, the Master Kalefactress observes lewd acts.<br /><br />There is a perfunctory introduction & an inglorious conclusion which is scummy, unsuccessfully written and/or poorly translated, but even if meant to merely mimic a depraved person's thoughts -- it absolutely falls short.  Totally lacking is some level of explanatory preface to indicate fantasy, fiction or a level of genuineness or authenticity where \\"names & places were changed to...\\", etc.	2005-10-09

In the process, he has audaciously ventured to disagree with many venerated masters and philosophical doctrines. Now that all these commentaries are available in one single volume, one should relish the delightful arguments and illumining explanations.<br /><br />It is important to know that, out of the repeated revision of these commentaries was born, 'The Life Divine', by far, the greatest philosophical work to date. His shorter commentary on the Kena Upanishad deals with epistemological issues while that on Isha takes up the ontological aspects. These works are much more accessible than the sophisticated idiom of 'The Life Divine', and, in fact, serve as guide-books.	2005-10-09

Starting a business with a lot of money is a bad idea and this book makes that case better than any other.  Using your cash instead of your brains will get you in more trouble than you need.    I teach Entrepreneurship at the University of Southern Mississippi and have found this book to be outstanding.  It is not an academic textbook but more of a nuts-and-bolts primer to actually getting a business off the ground while conserving your cash.      Making use of Other People's Money is the essence of intelligent business finance.  People do not start businesses intending to fail and yet most businesses do fail and the number one reason is that they run out of cash.  \\"Cash is King\\" and the longer you can make yours last the more likely you are to build a successful business.    This book gives practical examples of how to do that as well as cautionary tales of believing that your business cannot fail.    I cannot stress the importance of reading this book prior to building your business plan or embarking on a business venture.	2005-10-09

Instead of really telling you how to do things, it focuses on how you can make things more easy on yourself.<br /><br />It discusses the preparation, the shoot itself and post-production of the images. It doesn't tell you how to shoot perfectly, because in many conditions this just isn't possible. It does discuss how you can deal with those circumstances, making them work for you instead of you work for them all the time. It's general in its guidelines, but in-depth enough to show you how to do things for yourself.<br /><br />This book assumes that you're a bit creative (which you really are, don't worry) and then helps you develop this creativity.<br /><br />There's a lot in there, too much to put in here.

Sometimes things go past without us noticing, seedlings grow, seasons change and however many twists and turns our lives may take, nature unobtrusively exists alongside us. Rather than getting his \\"ears blown out\\" at gigs, Glen E Friedman, the notorious photographer of hip hop's golden era has taken his lens away from the stage and instead he's pointing it to the sky. Booking the window seat, and documenting \\"the uniqueness of every single second never to be possible again,\\" Recognize is the result of a five year project to capture the beauty of the world above. To Glen, clouds represent \\"the planet, our dreams, the past and the future. Absolute beauty, and perfection in nature.\\" Famed for his insider's perspective and \\"personal responsibility to the planet to inspire through vision and pictures\\", Glen adopts the same intimacy he did with the musicians, skaters and individuals who defined his career and whose careers he, in turn, helped define. Glen has always championed and documented the outsider and the caustic, from the American hardcore movement (photographing bands like Black Flag, Minor Threat and Bad Brains), to the early '80s rap scene (Run DMC, Ice-T and Public Enemy), right down to Tony Alva's Lords Of Dogtown skate era. In Recognize, page after page of huge, bold, other-worldly cumulus clouds in fluctuating colours, shape and density suck you in, spin you out and submerge you deep in the stratosphere. \\"So much of what has been passing for art in my lifetime really has so little technical skill, so little craftsmanship involved, so little of anything of interest to me other than some occasional entertainment. This was my chance to truly realign the aesthetic.\\" There's something resolutely powerful yet disconcertingly unsettling, as the clouds swirl and balloon above us, quietly in their own glory and we in oblivion rush back and forth below. \\"Plain heavenly,\\" Glen iterates. It makes you feel guilty for not noticing. Go on, look up. We dare you.	2005-10-09

Singularity Sky is an excellent scifi yarn and compelling space opera.  Stross has created a very interesting universe where 90% of the Earth's population  has been forcibly removed from Earth (by the Eschaton, a super intelligence) and distributed in such a way as to create some very unique cultures.  The trouble starts when the Carnival, who are masters of matter transformation, create anything and everything any wants on one of the colonies of the New Republic.  This of course destroys the colony's economy and feudal government.  The New Republic attempts to respond to this threat with conventional warships, not truly understanding what they are up against.  Singularity Sky follows two visitors to the New Republic from Earth who do understand how badly the New Republic are overmatched and attempt to lead them in a more rational direction, especially when the New Republic attempts to use time travel to gain an advantage.  The universe where this all takes place is quite fascinating and the characters are well written.  Stross adds a bit of mystery to the story as the goals of the earthlings are revealed to the reader and to the both of them.  Definitely a worthwhile read.	2005-10-09

People should know that this book cannot be the only thing that helps them stop their behavior. A behavior that is so much a part of them can only be changed through counseling, love, support, and the actual desire to change. This help might be an EXTRA help in ADDITION TO therapy for some people, but for most, this is a load of bull. Another thing is that this book and therapy and stuff is only going to work on someone who is ready to stop their behavior. This book should have been more about comforting and supporting self-injurers instead of judging them for a behavior they cannot help. I don't see what is wrong with injuring yourself in order to feel calmer and happier. Even if you do want to stop cutting, this book is no where NEAR the amount of help a person needs to stop a behavior so necassary to their very survival. What a self-injurer needs is a trained and licensed proffessional, not some book they found in the bargain bin.	2005-10-09

The author has in depth knowledge of early 18th England.  Very different from the kind of shallow research that one would have find if the author was not an academic expert to begin with.  Therefore, there is a fascinating realism in book's depiction of life in London as one would experience it at 1720. Superimposed on this structure is a rather routine and standard murder mystery. The only interesting part of that murder mystery is the internal conflict in private detective's mind about his Jewish heritage.  The rest of the mystery: physical fights with swords, fists, and pistols, murders, implausible and unrealistic twists and turns...etc are the usual stuff that one can see if you go to your local book store and pick a book at random from the mystery section.	2005-10-09

Here it should be remembered that Kimmerling is a scholar of very questionable credentials whose major achievement is ignoring the actual history of the Arab inhabitants of Southern Syria ( As they thought of themselves until Arafat et al. in the early sixties provided them a new name , a national identity, and a way of bamboozling the world. Here Kimmerling tries to prove that Ariel Sharon is involved in destroying that new national Arab identity .<br /><br />However since this book has been published Ariel Sharon withdrew Israeli forces from Gaza, and went before the United Nations to openly support a Palestinian state, even though he firmly believes that historically the Jewish claim to the Holy Land is  a far more legitimate one.<br /><br />Kimmerling ignores totally the eighty -years plus  war the Arabs( Not only the Palestinians ) have waged to drive the Jews from the Middle East. He ignores the fact that the Palestinian Arabs have refused Great Power offers of a state within the Holy Land five - times. He of course ignores too the fact that Ariel Sharon , the villain of this piece, is in favor of the Bush road-map plan calling for a Palestinian Arab state.<br /><br />Kimmerling has devoted his academic life to constructing Palestine for the Arabs, and destroying Israel for the Jews.<br /><br />He will have his own small chapter in the book of Jewish self- hatred ,Torquemada to Chomsky.<br /><br />It is not the worse thing in the world to be pompous, as the writing in this book is. However it is one of the worse for a historian and sociologist to ignore the evidence of history and present reality,and to create a text which is a tissue of myths and lies.	2005-10-09

And though the writing is simple and there is very little character development. I still was able to read it on one afternoon. It does help that the book is short. Though it has 380 pages, the typeset and margins make it equivalent to a 100-page book. <br /> <br />In this book we have Carpathia no longer being Mr. Nice guy. He orders that everyone will worship him. And to prove their loyalty they have a choice. They may take the mark of the beast; or have their heads cut off. We do read about the process of choice in Greece. And I have to say the violence is very graphic. <br /> <br />Of course with the mark being applied, those Tribulation Saints that are still out in the Global Community have to flee. And we have the Tribulation Force helping them escape where they can. Of course they cannot help everyone. Though they do what they can. <br /> <br />The end of this book has Carpathia heading to Jerusalem. Where he will desecrate the holy temple and proclaim himself God. Thereby breaking his pact with Israel. <br /> <br />Even though I only rated this book two stars. If you plan to continue the series to its conclusion, as I do, you will need to read it. It introduces new characters and sets up some of the next events. For example I think they will write about the exodus of Gods Chosen from Israel. <br />	2005-10-09

Iola (our heroine) is being forced to marry an old man.  Her family is thrilled since Lord Stoneham will offer her a title and comfortable life.  But he is old enough to be her grandfather and Iola is NOT thrilled!  Having been raised by a loving nanny who still keeps in touch, Iola runs off to ask her advice.  I won't spoil the part where she visits the nanny.  It turns out to be a unique situation.  I will tell you how descriptions of Nanny sharing fanciful stories and love to Iola as they reminisce about her childhood show how this wonderful woman shaped Iola into a lovely young lady.      <br /> <br />Iola ends up as nanny to a sweet little girl who acts so grown up.  (How Iola happens to get this position is part of what you must read in the visit to Nanny).  Lucy (the little girl) has a very rich father, Sir Wolfe Renton.  He cares about Lucy (but is not over-attentive) and does not want her head filled with fanciful stories and informs Iola of this.  Iola tries not to pass on her imagination but is unsuccessful.  She also comes to love Lucy.  Lucy soaks up the affection like a sponge.  There are some funny situations as a very precocious Lucy converses with Lady Isabel, a rather conniving woman who desires to be Sir Wolfe's mistress (and perhaps blackmail him also).   <br /> <br />Throw in beautiful locations as the \\"house party\\" of Sir Wolfe sails upon his yacht to the south of France and the adventure of a kidnapping and you have an amusing afternoon read.  Of course Iola falls in love but will that love be returned?   <br />	2005-10-09

It does have much eroticism with is the only thing that makes the book interesting.  The plot is sooo perfect for the typical brilliant Hellish twist in which lee is known for ... yet it never comes... in fact there is barely any supernatural happenings in the entire plot. And the ending? It is very very forced...and could have been so evil and intense yet Lee seems to have held back significantly - totally unlike him.  The book is a crime story with a few weird things thrown in so it can be called a \\"horror\\" book.  <br /> <br />I pray this isnt the direction Lee will be going down ... because this isnt horror...its crime suspense. <br /> <br />My recommendation is Ed Lee's INCUBI which is nothing short of amazing - from an intellectual standpoint as well as a entertaining stand point. If you dont want to spend the 20$, pick up FLESH GOTHIC.  I'll take them over $tephen King any day.    <br />	2005-10-09

There is almost no discussion of the impact made by cruisers, other than on the building of others. In general it is superficial, with little discussion of the detail of technological changes which lead to design development, eg in propulsion systems, metalurgy and gun development, with the exception of american missile and nuclear power technology post WW2 - it is disappointingly ethnocentric. <br />There is almost no discussion of the impact of specific commanders and notable cruises, or operational histories - probably the greatest being Thomas Cochrane in command of HM brig Speedy, and since the days of sail such as Karl Von Muller of SMS Emden are mentioned in passing, with no detail of their successes and failings. The role of the German Hifcruizers is passed over and there is no discussion of the impact of disruption of sailing of convoys and individual shipping by the presence , successful or otherwise of various cruiser forays, nor any discussion of the details of significant cruiser vs cruiser actions eg Coronel, the falklands and so on.  <br />The failings of various classes of cruisers are glossed over with simplistic comments such as they were not very successful, without discussing why.  <br /> <br />The book contains a variety of really basic factual errors - for instance p117 radar does NOT \\"consist of machinery that transmits sound waves over great distances\\" <br /> <br />Overall, if you want an overview of the impact of cruisers etc, you wont get it here.	2005-10-09

That's real.<br /><br />Metaphor: His metaphor of taking 19 people out to lunch every week for the rest of your life and them expecting you to pay because you work hard and earn more money than they do...BECAUSE...you work smart and hard...is wonderful. It shows the clear divide between those who are in-dependent and those who feel they are entitled to eat off the plates of those who are independent.<br /><br />His discussion on taxes is well done. His analysis of the current political situation. (Crummy democratic candidates for President coming in the next few elections...vs. a generally better group of Conservative options including McCain and Rice.<br /><br />I'm a Libertarian.

Banks is one of the few really gifted writers of sci-fi, and this novel is no exception.  The story itself -- a prolonged quest for a secret technology to save an isolated system from a ruthless invader -- seems familiar enough.  But, as always with Banks, half the fun is in the telling: the brilliant array of characters whom Fassin Taak (a human \\"Slow Seer\\") encounters on his travels.  However, as one gradually learns, the actual point of his travels is quite different from what it seems to be at the time, both to us and to Fassin.  I won't reveal the secret, of course, but keep your eye on the Dwellers, who understand \\"the mystery of the universe\\" far more deeply than the human characters do, and who are, or who at least may be, willing to make a tragic choice in revealing that mystery.  See if you can keep up!  I have to admit that I was entirely astonished by the ending. <br /> <br />Along the way: the description of the sailboat race on Nasq is simply dazzling.

It was definitely a page-turner.  I appreciated that she brought back several of the most popular characters from the series (yummy Drustan and Daegus Mackelter in particular), and that she set the stage nicely for the next several novels to come.  There seemed to be a little less humor in this novel than in, say, Kiss of the Highlander, but all in all the characters were engaging and the male protagonist, Cian Mackelter, was scrumptious and sexy. <br /> <br />I don't have a problem with Ms. Moning sticking to the same formula that has worked in the past as long as she keeps coming up with new and exciting characters to play out the time travel romances at which she excels...and this was definitely one of those.	2005-10-09

He intuitively captures the significance of the Internet:  the way it breaks down all the old silos of expertise and authority and distributes them into the homes of everyone.  The best part is probably the description of Jonathan Lebed, the 15-year online trader charged with securities fraud by the SEC...and the complete inability of the SEC to come to grips with the absurdity of the situation.	2005-10-09

The omega number arises in the context of what is called algorithmic information theory, which the author of this book has been instrumental in developing. It is not a difficult concept to understand at least from the standpoint of where it stands in the deductive ladder of modern mathematics. The goal of algorithmic information theory was to formulate a notion of randomness that was not only rigorous from a mathematical standpoint but was also embedded in the notion of an algorithm. Recognizing that it is impossible to construct and infinite random sequence using a (deterministic) algorithm, the author's main contribution was to define a random infinite (binary) sequence using what he has called the `halting probability.' The omega number, or `halting probability' is defined with respect to a (prefix) machine that halts for some input program. Since the machine can halt, the omega number is positive, but is less than 1 since the machine does not always halt. The omega number is a probabilistic notion since it is the probability that the machine halts if its program is given by a sequence of fair coin tosses. The author shows that the omega number is a random real number, is not computable, and therefore transcendental. All of these notions he discusses in fair detail in the book. The omega number, as he defines and discusses it, is quite an astounding quantity, for he concludes that it measures what can be known by human reason. If the entire edifice of mathematics were compressed to a particular number of bits, then the omega number (for this number of bits) can be used to decide whether every result in this edifice is true or false (or independent).<br /><br />The book is interesting reading, the reader obtaining insight into how the omega number was discovered, its role in the philosophy of mathematics, and its ramifications in the automatic discovery of mathematics. In addition, there are many places in the book where the author gives sound advice on how best to pursue research in science and mathematics, and even philosophy. For example, he encourages the sharing of ideas in order for them to become successful. He also complains of the excessive egotism that permeates the scientific community, and describes this as \\"poisoning\\" science. In this regard, he correctly notes that scientific results are the product of many minds, and that their prioritization to one individual is wrong and instead is diffused over the population of researchers.<br /><br />The author is correct in saying that mathematics is not very different from physics, and that the creation of mathematics involves intuition and guesswork. But he is not convincing in showing that this intuition cannot be emulated in a (calculating) machine, but merely takes it to be an activity that must take place due to the limitations arising from the omega number. It is one thing to prove that the omega number places limits on mathematics. It is quite another to characterize \\"intuition\\" explicitly, freeing it from its current mystical connotations, and showing how it operates to bring about creative ideas in mathematics. And yes, mathematics must be beautiful, as the author states in the book. Aesthetic quality in pure mathematics has driven many of the research programs in mathematics. But mathematical beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and varies radically from one mathematician to another. Each mathematician deploys their own hedonic function when judging the beauty of particular mathematical constructions.<br /><br />The author also mentions AM (Automated Mathematician) in the book, calling it, interestingly, a \\"program.\\" At the time it first appeared, AM was thought of as \\"intelligent\\" and had the capability of creating original concepts in mathematics. After this initial confidence, it was then subjected to intense criticism, and due to this criticism AM was abandoned both by its creator and everyone else in the automated reasoning community of researchers. It has now become merely a \\"program\\", i.e. a collection of statements that cannot possibly be thought of as intelligent or creative.<br /><br />The author though exaggerates the ramifications of the incompleteness theorems of Godel and in the formalist program of Hilbert. The everyday practice and discovery of mathematics is not done formally, and if it were it is doubtful that mathematicians could be as productive as they are.  Mathematical results are reported using a mixture of natural language and mathematical syntax, and in no way are like the formal languages that Godel and Hilbert insist on. So the results of Godel do not cause any trouble for mathematics, since all mathematical research is expressed in informal language. And there are no examples of statements of the Godelian type being derived in the everyday practice of mathematics. Godelian statements must be artificially contrived and even then using a non-constructive diagonalization argument. Therefore it is of no surprise at all to find out that all of mathematics has not been derived from a small collection of mathematics. It is certainly not discovered that way, but rather arises as vague, random mental associations in the mind of the mathematician. Once discovered though, the results are published, using as much rigor as practical, with this rigor being constrained by the use of natural language. It remains to be seen whether the use of natural language can be eliminated ala the strategy of Bourbaki. If it can, maybe using a variant of discourse representation theory or some other strategy, then it is not unreasonable to believe that all mathematical results can be derived from a few axioms. If they cannot, this is no reason for worry, as they are intrinsically beautiful in themselves, and their applications will still go on and on.hers.

The thing that caught my attention is that Mr. Hajnasr has so much passion and respect for the late Bruce Lee and his art.  Mr. Hajnasr's passion is best described through a passage from his book, in which I got off EBAY, listed below. <br />  Thank you for the opportunity to spread the art of Jeet Kune Do, as developed by the late Bruce Lee.  Bruce Lee is the founder of Jeet Kune Do (JKD), my idol and inspiration.   My skills are not by any means compared to the skills of Sijo (Bruce Lee) or any other JKD instructors in any way, shape, or form. This book is based on my own interpretation, which is a complete \\"System Without a System.\\"  My practice of Jeet Kune Do is a combination of other martial arts skills based on Bruce Lee's fighting methods, principles, and philosophy, in which I have learned over the years and compiled into one detailed book.  Many people suggested I call my book \\"The Encyclopedia of JKD,\\" because of its in-depth explanation.  This book demonstrates Jeet Kune Do step-by-step, which is something that has not been done before, though many have claimed to have authored such a work.  As such, I urge you to compare knowledge, talent and skills and I am sure you will see the difference.  <br /> As a  female Law Enforcement Officer, I found the weapons defense section extremely helpful for my line of work.  I will recommend this book to my fellow officers, and encourage others to read it as well. <br />	2005-10-09

However, once you pick it up, it's very hard to put down. The set up is as follows; Watanuki Kimihiro sees and is drawn to spirits around him, a fact that he gives him endless misery. One day on the street he is mysteriosly pulled to a \\"shop\\", which looks like an old Victorian manor, and into a conversation with it's unusual raven haired owner Yuko. Through a series of what she claims is preordained events, Watanuki enters a contract with her- she'll get rid of the spirits for a little help around the shop. Too bad he's working for a space time witch. What ensues is plenty of philosophy, demon exorcising and wish helping lightened by often humorous banter between the slightly sarcastic, uptight Watanuki and the dark, mysterious, melodramatic and slightly nutty Yuko. As other reviewers have mentioned, Tsubasa; Reservoir Chronicle characters make appearances just about every volume, and some of the events move between the two series and impact each manga's storyline. Hence, many will just have to pick up a copy of Tsubasa to get the other perspective. The art is dark and sensuous with a striking asian sensibilty and many references to the butterfly- arguably some of CLAMP's most lush and beautiful work. However, I would not recommend this series to those new to this genre, as the references to other works, manga, and japanese cultural nuances come thick and fast. Ideally you would have already read some of CLAMP's other works before diving in to xxxHolic, as Clampers will delight in the subtle and not so subtle references to series like Magic Knight Rayearth, Legal Drug- the boys get a cameo!-and most notably Cardcaptor Sakura. (Clow gets numerous references, as do things like Sakura's baton and even Kero!) Ultimately, a brilliant and dark edition to the genre that connects many of the pieces in the Clamp universe for loyal Clampers but is highly enjoyable for all.	2005-10-09

Widowed Zoe and her mother in law Winifred, have always been at loggerheads, with Winifred insisting that her late son married beneath him, and, because of her stubborness and pride, has cut off contact with Zoe and her daughter, Katie. Saying that she would need to see the property before investing her money and, not mentioning the fact that she has a serious illness looming, she comes for a visit and immediately puts everyone's back up with her domineering ways and arrogance. Katy has also moved in with her mother after the death of her severely handicapped daughter, but without knowing any of the details of Winifred's hurtful attitude to Zoe and her refusal to help in the years following the death of Zoe's husband, cuts through the barrier of years to become very attached to her grandmother. This is the story of three generations of women of the same family, trying to bond, trying to forgive and trying to make sense of their lives at this point. I don't know that I'd be quite as forgiving to such a hurtful person, even if I did know her background and some of the reasons for her behaviour, but then, perhaps I'm not of such a generous spirit as these women!	2005-10-09

Smith seems determined to write a sensational work of popular history; unfortunately, the subject he picked doesn't lend itself to his purpose. The attempt of \\"agent\\" George Mathews to stir up the residents of Spanish Florida to declare their independence and then cede their lands to the United States was not only a minor and, finally, futile event, but subsequent developments made the whole thing pointless. By 1812, war with Britain seemed eminent and the US was worried that Britain would try to seize West Florida; the government ordered forces into the area although diplomatically it had to deny this to the Spanish authorities. This duplicity rankles Smith. So much of what was going on was done covertly and behind the scenes, with apparently so little at stake, that it's hard to find much interest in Smith's account. Smith's sensational intentions are made clear when he opens the book with a chapter on James and Dolley Madison's marriage and their \\"inability\\" to have children. There are also no footnotes, odd for a \\"serious\\" historical work.<br /><br />One thing Smith declares that I can't agree with is his belief that the War of 1812 was lost by the Americans. There were two major causes of that war: America's abhorrance of her sailors being suppressed by English men-of-war and England's fear that America wanted to conquer Canada. It's true that when hostilities ended, neither of those concerns entered into the peace treaty signed by both nations, but never again were American sailors suppressed nor Canada threatened. In addition, America was once and for all an independent nation no longer dependent on others, especially England, for its economic survival. Sounds like a victory to me - for both sides.	2005-10-09

Nothing could be further from the truth.  This book is written with a clear eye and a sense of humor, and the author possesses an unusually perceptive and good-natured outlook on the people involved, both orphans and staff at the orphanage.  He doesn't pull any punches when describing the inevitable abuses and hardships that did occur, but he doesn't dwell on or sensationalize them.  He discusses the many positive aspects of \\"home\\" life in detail as well, and he concludes the book warmly, thankful that the staff at the orphanage was there to care for him.  The book is full of local color and casual social commentary as well, so if you're interested in 1920's Texas, you should definitely take a look. This is a touching and historically significant book that is worth looking for.	2005-10-09

And excellent book on an area that is neglected in magick but is a major part of life for almost everyone.  <br /> <br />We spend 40 (50) hours a week at the work site, with several people. Yet spells, when they refer to work are all about getting a job. Once you've got it, there's very little about support on the job, how to work. Also, the author spends a lot of time on emphasizing what you want out of a job or situation so you know what you want out of a spell. I particularly like her spell for initiation and how 'initiation' can be very broadly defined. It sounds simple but thinking through what your goal is really makes a difference than just throwing a spell at the surface problem.  <br /> <br />I totally recommend this book. And a lot of it can be applied to other areas of life as well.	2005-10-09

The scope is smaller than his usual work, and the plot feels a bit like a catastrophe movie, but it's very well executed.    A sightseeing shuttle is trapped below 15 meters of dust while travelling on one of the Moon's craters. The rest of mankind are working out a way to dig them up again, while they're slowly running out of calm and oxygen...    The scientific details of the accident, its subsequent terrors, and the rescue operation, are as always authoritative and clearly explained. Very believable.    Characterization was never Clarke's strongest point, and it's a bit cheap here too. Usually, it's not that important in hard SF, but here I feel it would be in order. The trapped people could have been fleshed out to make us care for them more. I came to associate their names with their professions rather than with their personalities. There are some really awkward \\"romantic\\" moments between the captain of the shuttle and the stewardess, and the humour attempts are downright cringeworthy. Clarke has the characters \\"bursting with laughter\\" over a couple of jokes that are simply embarrassing to read.    Also among the trapped is a \\"legendary explorer\\" (more or less presented as the greatest hero of the space age) who always knows what to do, and of course a brilliant physicist with the sole purpose of telling us what troubles he foresees. Including those two in the story I consider outright cheating on Clarke's part.    Of the outside characters, we are constantly told (as opposed to SHOWN) that Dr. Lawson, although helpful to the cause, is obnoxious and without social virtues, but he ended up being my favourite character simply because he wasn't so damn likeable all the time (Clarke's heroes are usually great leaders without a single human fault, or curiosity-driven university nerds, who, if Clarke had his way, would always get the girl).    Anyway, along with the science forming the backbone, Clarke's expertise in storytelling is what really makes this book shine. We follow the parallel storylines of the trapped people and the people on the outside working against and around the clock to save the shuttle. Nature has an endless amount of nasty tricks in store for the trapped ship, and Clarke presents them at just the right time, when you think all is safe for the moment. He makes it feel like you're there yourself, and that I would say is the mark of success in this kind of story. The final stage of the rescue attempt is really thrilling, and I'm not usually impressed with cheesy Hollywood scenes of that kind. But he pulls it off really well, and I finished the book feeling satisfied.    What makes this book fall slightly behind stuff like \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\" or \\"Childhood's end\\" is mainly that the setting is so small (and realistic!) that the ending becomes predictable. In his other books you often have NO IDEA how the story is going to unfold. Here there are only two possible ends - they live or they die. But he made that question interesting too, and so I recommend the book.	2005-10-09

Sam ponders during the entire novel if she should take her relationship with the presiden't son to The Next Level, and in the end, nothing is a big deal, but it should be.

I had a feeling that the only reason it was receiving such praise was because of the timeliness of it's subject matter. Finally after reading glowing review upon glowing review and finding that the book was still one of the top-10 bestsellers at my favorite bookstore (Elliot Bay Books in Seattle) I bought it.  I am  sorry to say my fears were justified.   <br /> <br />The plot is extremely formulaic, I'm sure I've read each \\"twist\\" or plot device the author used in at least 7 other books.  In addition the sheer number of these plot twists and surprise revelations would put a Mexican soap-opera to shame.  The characters are also very generic and are not developed at all. The most we ever get about the inner life of any character is about 1 page.  <br /> <br />This book provides very little entertainment and has even less literary merit.  The only reason that this doesn't get one star is because the author is a competent writer (in a journalistic sense) and because of a couple of interesting facts about Afghanistan that are included in the book.	2005-10-09

The same concept of two people with a telepathic connection linked with sexual tendencies has been done before, and frankly a lot better. Probably the best book I've read with that topic was MIMOSA GROVE, by Dinah McCall. Maybe if I had read this one before that, I would have thought differently about it. It was not a bad read, but there really was little to the story line and no great twists or surprise ending. Not even a reveal of any kind. It just kind of died off and was fairly non-climactic. I hate to say something so negative about this book when it was okay, but it just didn't do it for me. Is it worth the money to buy? Possibly. If you are into the sci-fi paranormal, sord of X-files story and like a lot of heated sex to your romance, than you will probably enjoy this book. As far as the plot goes, read it with an open mind and don't expect too much. That way, you won't be dissappointed.

My class was told that it would help to lead us into this chapter in our history class.  The first day of school, the teacher asked us how the book was coming along and found out firsthand just how open a class we are.  We all hated it.  It was terrible!  Every chapter tells a different tribe's story, but it was all the same.  This book was so repetitive.  There is a fight, there is a treaty, the whites break the treaty, there is another fight, and the Indians endure a terrible massacre.  I was saddened to read about the poor Indians, but it got a little old after the first 5 times or so.  Many of the people in my class are having so much trouble getting through the book, that they are either skimming through the book and risking the bad grade, or are buying the summary of each chapter off of a website.  The review on the front of the book reads, \\"...Impossible to put down.\\"  I found this true because after around 20 pages of reading this book, I would fall asleep with the book in my hand.

Every year hundreds of thousands of tourists and avid \\"river rats\\" float every type of river in the country. Challenging rivers like the Colorado through the Grand Canyon to the Middle Fork of the Salmon in Idaho, fromthe Tuolumme in California to the Gauley in West Virginia, are routinely rafted by adventurers seeking the challenge and thrill of facing these liquid locomotives. It is not uncommon to wait up to 15 years for a private permit and up to 3 years for a seat on a commercial raft trip through the Grand Canyon.<br /><br />Predictably, there are numerous books about individual whitewater rafting experiences and a respectable number that explain how to participate in the sport with or without the benefit of a guide. In addition, a few former guides have written books about their experiences but remarkably there are few anthologies written by river guides that purport to tell the truth about river running on western rivers.<br /><br />This book seeks to remedy that oversight by providing stories from 30 former and current \\"river rats\\" that will provide as good a description as one is likely to get of the less than scientific method of river running as practiced by a bunch of \\"...misfits and misanthropes, dreamers and daredevils, weekend warriors and professional guides, nataphobes and bibliophiles, \\"established voices\\" and undiscovered gems.\\" In short, these are stories purported to be factual from a group that's primary claim to fame is storytelling regardless of the truth. It is that and much more.<br /><br />The stories of kayakers, dory men, canoeists, rafters and assorted others are humorous, thoughtful, questionable, and a reminder of the river lore that has lured rafters to water since Huckelberry Finn. There are stories about nude canoeists, games and pranks favored by river guides, lost tourists on the river and a host of others that provide a hard-to-put down account of both adventures and misadventures on western rivers. Not to be missed is Jessica Maxwell's account of forcing herself to face the \\"grim river reaper\\" that is probably more true for a number of rafters than they would, or will, admit. While some of the essays appear to be designed to glorify the writer they are more than offset by the works of such legends as Bruce Berger, John Nichols, Scott Thybony, Brand Dimock and Edward Abbey. To read these eclectic accounts of river experiences is to be introduced to wilderness writings of the first order. Highly recommended.both adventures and misadventures on western rivers.

Read this book, but read it in print and bring these wonderful characters alive with your own mind's voice.

The book explains how various conspiracy beliefs have been shifted into a realm normally occupied by such stigmatized and underground beliefs as those of the New Age and UFO subcultures.  In addition conspiracy beliefs in the rise of a New World Order, beliefs in UFO abductions, government experiments in mind control, forbidden knowledge, occult science, alternative medicine, revisionist history, and speculations about the nature of reality have been combined into what Barkun refers to as \\"superconspiracies\\" which provide a systematic epistemological understanding of reality. <br /> <br />First though I have some criticisms of the book.  Barkun obviously supports the establishment view of history, politics, and science.  As such he seems to believe that conspiracy theories are \\"unfalsifiable\\" which he defines to be the determiner of a scientific theory (an arguable point) and therefore can be easily dismissed.  Barkun dismisses the claims and beliefs of various liberty loving individuals who seek to track the development of an all-encompassing global government without really backing up his dismissals except by appealing more to establishment beliefs.  Further, Barkun seems to believe that \\"improvisational millennialism\\" can be dangerous, leading to violence.  His claims on this point appear overly alarmist, particularly in the light of the very dangers posed today by modern governments.  Finally, Barkun refers to conspiracy beliefs as \\"right wing\\" and part of the \\"antigovernment right\\".  Such references to traditional political categories of right versus left seem feeble in the light of the encompassing nature of conspiracy theories.  Indeed, conspiracy theories are as often left wing as right wing, and simplistic categorizations of themserve no further purpose than providing a conveninent label with which to stigmatize and dismiss.  Nevertheless, despite these criticisms much in this book is interesting in that it provides a systematic approach to understanding the convergence of various subcultures as well as the rise of millennial beliefs among the conspiracist underground. <br /> <br />Two central things to most conspiracy beliefs are the presence of a hidden organization controlling events (usually the Illuminati, based on the very real quasi-masonic secret society of the Bavarian Illuminati founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776) and the rise of a New World Order (often with reference to Bush I's speech identifying a \\"new world order\\").  Barkun outlines in successive chapters the origins of the Illuminati in conspiracy literature as well as the role of the New World Order.  Barkun considers both religious millennial sources involving the coming of Antichrist (particularly with reference to Christian dispensationalism) as well esoteric \\"secular\\" sources focusing on elite conspirators.  Barkun considers the role of various government agencies in conspiracy beliefs including particularly the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as well as attempts at mind control by the CIA.  Barkun also discusses the notorious black helicopters and U.N. concentration camps which are bandied about by many New World Order conspiracy theorists. <br /> <br />Three prominent individuals played an important role in the creation of late 1990s conspiracy theories.  These included the researcher Jim Keith, who notoriously emphasized both black helicopters, UFOs, and CIA mind control experiments.  The tax protestor and favorite of the militias Milton William Cooper, a former military officer who expressed belief in UFO conspiracies at one point.  And, the eccentric New Age conspiracist David Icke, who has made various outrageous claims involving New World Order conspiracies and a \\"reptilian agenda\\".  Both Jim Keith andMilton William Cooper died mysteriously which has led to much speculation on their deaths by researchers (Cooper died in a shoot-out with local authorities). <br /> <br />Barkun also discusses the role of UFOs in conspiracy literature.  Barkun believes that UFOs which are actively believed in by a sizable portion of the population serve to legitimize conspiracy beliefs.  (Of course his argument here assumes that conspiracy beliefs are illegitimate to begin with!)  Barkun also discusses various esoteric beliefs in the existence of an inner earth, both in pulp literature (including especially the Shaver mystery) as well as in non-fictional travel narratives such as those of Ferdinand Ossendowski.  Barkun also discusses the role of anti-Catholicism, anti-masonry, and anti-Semitism in various conspiracy beliefs as well as the rise of these beliefs within certain UFO circles.  Barkun seems overly enthusiastic to attribute these labels to individuals who may take alternative views on religion to those expressed in the mainstream.  Finally, Barkun turns his attention to various conspiracy beliefs that arose out of the September 11, 2001 disaster. <br /> <br />This book provides a good compendium for understanding various conspiracy beliefs.  However, it must be approached with caution because Barkun obviously represents an establishment viewpoint opposed to all alternative modes of thinking.   <br />	2005-10-09

There's a cleverness in his conceits here, the way he reimagines cartoon and fairy tale characters into new and sometimes seemingly outlandish situations.  But he's talented enough to never falter.  Beneath the slick veneer there's a troubled, wildly beating heart.  It's an often lonely, bruised or despondent heart, and it's that juxtaposition that makes this collection so riveting and striking and moves it well beyond clever pulp and thrusts it into literary originality.  He doesn't shy away from unsavory characters -- sometimes they creep up on you, and sometimes they hit you full in the face -- but one of his greatest feats is how manages to twist and change our initial impressions.  Whether it's through a re-imagined modern-day Dick Tracy, a pair of (nonexistent)lucky pants, or a hitman named Big Elbow Macaroni, Ruland keeps you turning the pages and keeps you tangled up in the characters.  An excellent debut.	2005-10-09

Keroro and his extraterrestrial compatriots, in a failed attempt to conquer Pokopen (the Earth), find themselves stranded in the company of two Pokopenian siblings, Fuyuki and Natsumi Hinata, and their friends and family. Hilarity ensues. There you go. That's the series - beyond that there is no real coherent plot. But that's not particularly important, because the fact is a complex storyline isn't required for madcap comedy of this order.<br /><br />The best comparison you can draw to Sgt. Frog is probably to Pinky & the Brain: overloaded with pop culture (Japanese anyway) allusions and socio-political send-ups, our protagonist conjures up preposterous scheme after preposterous scheme, to no avail. Another easy comparison would be with Invader Zim. The biggest difference between Sgt. Frog and these others, however, is the ensemble size: while P&B revolved around the clashing personalities of the title characters, and Invader Zim a team of four or so, Sgt. Frog is propelled by a stable cast of about a dozen unique, distinctly off-the-wall personalities.<br /><br />There's Natsumi Hinata, for instance, the Pokopenian teen whose authoritative hot-headedness remains the biggest obstacle on the path to invasion - apart from Sgt. Keroro himself, equal parts inept interstellar conqueror and freeloading plastic Gundam model fanatic. Then there's Natsumi's younger brother Fuyuki, a quiet, introverted kid with a keen interest in the occultm or Momoka Nishizawa, the insecure heiress to a worldwide fortune with a keen interest in Fuyuki. Not to mention Private Tamama, one of the Sgt.'s fellow-invaders, whose adorable exterior belies a violent split personality; the ditzy Lady Angol Moa, sent to Earth by her father the universal Lord of Terror to destroy it, but diverted by Keroro's misadventures; and many more.<br /><br />The various plots, goofy and overblown as they are, make full use of the characters' interpersonal chemistry. For instance: when the School Sports Festival rolls around, athletic Natsumi petitions mom Aki to join her in the child-parent activities. But Aki is unable to attend due to her demanding career as a manga editor, which causes her to be gone most of the time anyway. Natsumi is forlorn by yet another absence, and while Keroro schemes to stand in for Mom Hinata in an attempt to put Natsumi in his debt, Corporal Giroro, whose hard-boiled shell hides a monstrous affection for the girl, has other plans. Meanwhile, Fuyuki suffers from a lack of self-confidence living in his sister's athletic shadow, and wealthy Momoka's attempts to aid his cause at the Festival, like having her bodyguards tranquilize the other racers, are sweet but probably misguided. That's just a sampling, from one of the tamer chapters at that - the insanity quotient is generally far more in excess.<br /><br />Many of the installments have sensitive undercurrents: unrequited love, the clash between friendship and duty, jealousy, emotional insecurity, family dynamics, and so on. But there's something of overanalyzing in that evaluation, because any pyschological underpinnings involved are offset by copious coatings of over-the-top illustration, harebrained scenarios, laugh-out-loud hilarious gags, and unforgettably zany characters. Be forewarned: in spite of Keroro and Company's admitted adorability it's not for kiddies - there's enough sexual suggestion here to border on ecchi at times. But it's all in fun, and if you have a well developed sense of the absurd, as I like to put it, Sgt. Frog is as good n' silly as it gets.use of the characters' interpersonal chemistry.

For some reason, Central Asia with its blood-stirring names -- Tashkent, Samarkand, the Silk Road, etc. -- has always fascinated me.  Bernstein, in his 50s, did what I, now in my 60s, would have liked to have done but didn't -- travel the Silk Road and exotic points beyond.  Perhaps his struggle with his mid-life crisis made his book all the more poignant to this old coot, but I found the story of the monk searching for truth and the story of the journalist searching for himself nicely completmentary.  By the time I had finished this delightful book, I felt that I had accompanied the author along the way.  And if Bernstein can do that for me, then I pronounce \\"Ultimate Journey\\" a helluva good read.	2005-10-09

It is difficult to tell exactly what is taking place. The narrator speaks in third person who is quite annoying at first but you get used to it; does not last through the whole book. Soon it becomes clear that Hiro is a pizza delivery boy who also thinks he is a samurai.  <br /> <br />Please don't stop reading after the first fifty or sixty pages as I almost did. I promise that it starts to make sense. The whole book is not about the process of future pizza delivery. If you stop, you will miss some of the best speculative fiction ever. Hiro must figure out who is unleashing a virus that can destroy minds through the Metaverse (the future internet). Rarely had a book raised my adrenalin levels as much as this did.  <br /> <br />I must admire an author who can take such a silly seeming idea and infuse it with so mush life and thankfully, Stephenson is writing faster than most people can read.

I knew that this book was in development. But I've  never been a big fan of \\"color\\" knitting. So, I wasn't anxiously awaiting its arrival. Boy was I in for a surprise. Although the book covers the basics of knitting with color, it goes so far beyond Fair Isle and Intarsia knitting. I find myself reading and reading and reading this book. Ms. Melville covers color theory in a way that's not at all intimidating. I've not considered the ideas she's presented here before...and all I can think of now is COLOR. This book has really ignited my interest in knitting with color. I really want to dive in and try out some of these techniques and ideas covered in the book. There are some great designs for men...I want to knit the vest and the \\"inside out\\" sweater immediately!  <br /> <br />A previous review gave  only one star and that surprised me. This book is a PERFECT addition to the pervious \\"Knitting Experience\\" book, \\"The Knit Stitch\\" and the \\"Purl Stitch.\\" Every knitter, whether beginning or experienced, will find him/her-self using this book as much as a reference as the pervious two.	2005-10-09

Beginner's Chinese has some good points.  It comes with two CDs featuring native speakers -- one for the lessons and one for Chinese syllable practice.  Simplified characters and pinyin are provided together for all material in the book. Each lesson has a good collection of exercises for translation, ad hoc response to questions, and grammar.  A Cultural Insights section that addresses some aspect of Chinese society caps each lesson.  The book has a pinyin-Wade Giles cross reference that is very helpful for English-speaking students. <br /> <br />But there are definitely areas for improvement.  This is a second edition.  The third edition could be a great book.  First, the CDs.  The CDs are indispensable, but each lesson takes up only a bit over three minutes.  No time is left between sentences for the student to practice pronunciation.  (The words can be pronounced if the student hurries.)  And then there is the organization.  On the CDs, first comes vocabulary, then sentence patterns, then conversations.  In the book, the order is sentence patterns, conversations, then vocabulary.  It would be nice if they were consistent and went through the lesson in order.  Much more use could have been made of the CDs, but here we get into a critique of the book itself. <br /> <br />In general, there is not enough practice material.  For example, in each chapter there is a list of \\"supplementary\\" words and expressions.  These are not used in the spoken exercises except to pronounce them once on the CD. <br /> <br />In the place of more practice material each chapter has extensive \\"language points\\" where the author sometimes belabors subtle linguistic points that, in my opinion, could be done without in an introductory text.  Here also is where speech patterns are discussed. In the actual Sentence Patterns section introducing each lesson, each \\"pattern\\" is given once, leaving the student to infer what the patterns are.  Most have the impression that the pattern sentences are just a collection of unique sentences.  Here is where more material should be added by giving additional examples of each pattern where such is possible. <br /> <br />In summary: <br /> <br />1. Remove the \\"supplementary\\" words and expressions section and just include it in the lesson vocabulary if individual words are important enough to include. <br />2. Make explicit what the pattern is for each pattern sentence. <br />Provide up to ten or twelve examples with each pattern using all the vocabulary introduced to that point. <br />3. Remove some of the show-off linguistics discussions and save them for a class on Chinese linguistics. <br />4. Include all the expanded practice material on the CDs with time for the students to repeat each sentence.  Since this may disrupt the continuity of the Conversations, I would suggest recording that section twice: first at normal conversation speed without breaks for comprehension practice; then a second time with a pause after each line so students can practice pronunciation.  If something has to go, do away with the Chinese syllable practice on the second CD, and continue the lessons on that CD.  It's more important for the students to get their syllable practice on their actual vocabulary rather than be able to recite the universe of abstract ba, bo, bi's. <br /> <br />If you are an instructor, realize that you are going to have to make up additional material to provide pattern and \\"supplementary\\" vocabulary practice and listen to student complaints about the CDs.  And hope the students don't lose their way or become discouraged trying to plough through the abstruse Language Points. <br />	2005-10-09

Alice makes me laugh up a storm, something I miss in teen novels these days. The second novel \\"Miss Smithers\\" was also funny but the plot seemed a bit forced and not too interesting. Still, it went by fast and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The third \\"Alice MacLeod, Realist at Last\\" is more of a romance. I missed the fact that Alice's boyfriend Goose has left the picture, but he is replaced by an equally lovable boy named Vince. Except Vince isn't exactly a boy, and he questions whether he is too old to be dating Alice.<br /><br />Alice's confusion over love and sex lead this novel with funny subplots about a prison-ridden mother, an unemployed father, and Alice's task to become a famous writer. Alice's writing is the best in this novel. In the second novel she wrote her own newspaper, but in \\"Alice MacLeod, Realist at Last\\" she heads out to write a script, which reads so utterly ridiculous, it's hilarious.<br /><br />A great read for the romantic, the one who loves to laugh, and anyone and everyone that wants to find a great friend in Alice.	2005-10-09

Empiricism is seen in distinction from Rationalism, in that it doubts the viability of universal principles (rational or otherwise), and uses sense data as the basis of all knowledge - experience is the source of knowledge.  Hume was a skeptic as well as empiricist, and had radical (for the time) atheist ideas that often got in the way of his professional advancement, but given his reliance on experience (and the kinds of experiences he had), his problem with much that was considered conventional was understandable.<br /><br />Hume's major work, 'A Treatise of Human Nature', was not well received intially - according to Hume, 'it fell dead-born from the press'.  Hume reworked the first part of this work in a more popular way for this text, which has become a standard, and perhaps the best introduction to Empiricism.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the idea of empiricism is that experience teaches, and rules and understanding are derived from this.  However, for Hume this wasn't sufficient.  Just because billiard balls when striking always behave in a certain manner, or just because the sun always rose in the morning, there was no direct causal connection that could be automatically affirmed - we assume a necessary connection, but how can this be proved?<br /><br />Hume's ideas impact not only metaphysics, but also epistemology and psychology.  Hume develops empiricism to a point that empiricism is practically unsupportable (and it is in this regard that Kant sees this text as a very important piece, and works toward his synthesis of Empiricism and Rationalism).  For Hume, empirical thought requires skepticism, but leaves it unresolved as far as what one then needs to accept with regard to reason and understanding.  According to scholar Eric Steinberg, 'A view that pervades nearly all of Hume's philosophical writings is that both ancient and modern philosophers have been guilty of optimistic and exaggerated claims for the power of human reason.'<br /><br />Some have seen Hume as presenting a fundamental mistrust of daily belief while recognising that we cannot escape from some sort of framework; others have seen Hume as working toward a more naturalist paradigm of human understanding.  In fact, Hume is open to a number of different interpretations, and these different interpretations have been taken up by subsequent philosophers to develop areas of synthetic philosophical ideas, as well as further developments more directly out of Empiricism (such as Phenomenology).<br /><br />This is in fact a rather short book, a mere 100 pages or so in many editions.  As a primer for understanding Hume, the British Empiricists (who include Hobbes, Locke, and Berkeley), as well as the major philosphical concerns of the eighteenth century, this is a great text with which to start.aims for the power of human reason.'

We usually read the headlines of the Vietnam War in the newspapers but they would never be able to take account of how the war affected the daily life of the ordinary people at a personal level. Of course, living in a war torn country where many big conflicts of the last 20th century occurred, there was no way to escape the events as they brutally unfolded. The author is telling his personal story but it may also be a story of any other Vietnamese as well. We were caught in the middle as the Cold war became a hot spot in a conflict rivaling between the capitalist and communist ideology. This conflict was artificial imposed on a little and poor Asian country and its people. As telling by the book, the war had not only been found on the battle field, it was also found inside our families, brother against brother, sister against sister, sometimes even between far and son. Our hearts were torn apart and filled with hate, bitterness and suspicious. These scars are still visible today between the Vietnamese living abroad and their country men in Vietnam. The American could leave on 30 April 1975, 30 years ago, but we the Vietnamese are still haunted by the ghost of war to the day today. We are still looking at each other with the same glasses as during the war time. A new generation of Vietnamese has grown up both abroad and inside Vietnam. We just pray they will be able to forgive and forget the pass, starting the healing process, learning the history as has been told in the book like this one and others that have been published. We must learn about our history in order to not make the same mistake again. No kind of war is more brutal and cruel as between brother and brother. Just ask the Americans about their own civil war. The book is heart fully recommend to be read by anyone whowant to have an insight of the Vietnam War.	2005-10-09

Philosophy) (English and German Edition)	Books	5	39	41	N	N	Husserl's last introduction	It is somewhat ironic that Phenomenology, as a term or as a philosophical school, has yet to really reach the popular consciousness, given that phenomenology is in many respects a study of consciousness and how reality impacts consciousness. Phenomenology in the most formal sense of being a school of philosophy is largely traced to Franz Brentano (1838-1917) and Edmund Husserl (1859-1938). Husserl's great work at the turn of the last century, Logical Investigations, set the stage for the development of phenomenology as a way of seeing, a descriptive study with roots in empiricism going back to inspiration from Aristotelian ideas. This is a key word - description. Rather than being a set of constructs and principles typical of previous philosophical systems, Phenomenology attempts to describe reality fully as reality is presented to our senses.<br /><br />Phenomenology is different from scientific study in that it does not pretend toward a universal truth or experience unmediated through our subjectivity (a principle modern science seems to be incorporating more and more). Editor Dermot Moran has a solid introduction to the subject, including distinctions of different kinds of study, some of the personalities involved in the development of phenomenology, and the current state of the discipline.<br /><br />This book by Husserl is one written late in his career.  The Nazi party was well on its way to taking complete power in Germany, and other forces of despair were very present in the Western culture.  Husserl's protege Heidegger had gone from phenomenology to existentialism, a philosophical framework that Husserl distrusted, but understood as completely in keeping with the overall crisis of meaning and purpose that he saw taking root in society at its very core.<br /><br />Husserl's work from 1900 forward was always involved in recasting and adapting phenomenology to the current culture; each of his books in that time had as a title or subtitle 'An Introduction to Phenomenology', and this particular text was no different.  Often overlooked in this text's presentation is that it was actually unfinished at Husserl's death, and had once again taken phenomenology in new directions.  Perhaps the most radical departure of this version of phenomenology to Husserl's earlier constructs is the incorporation of psychological ideas.<br /><br />Husserl's concern is to overcome the lack of meaning found in science and technology, the lack of telos and the lack of an inherent moral structure.  Husserl traces the history of ideas and search for meaning in intellectual enterprise, and ends with a sense of a 'life-world' that draws closer to the aims of existentialism than he had ever done before.<br /><br />This is a fascinating text.n to Phenomenology', and this particular text was no different.

Unlike Hastie's Statistical Learning book, it is not geared towards those with an expert level knowledge of statistics, and instead takes time to explain functions and formulas for the person with a decent but not extrordinary understanding of statistical/math concepts. For example, their description of a Gaussian was the clearest I've seen. On the other hand, if you're math/statistics background is considerable, you may find this book somewhat simplistic or tedious.    The book has a good coverage of techniques and algorithms, although I was somewhat disappointed that they do not mention Influence Diagrams, considering the amount of coverage of both decision trees and Bayesian techniques. Their discussion of Combining Multiple Models, however, is well done, and is not covered to this extent in most books I've seen. I also like how they broke out the discussion of input and output (knowledge representation) into their own chapters.    Addendum 10/30: After reading a good hunk of this book I still agree with most of what I said earlier, but I do think the authors could have gone into graphical models a lot more. At the end of the discussion on Bayesian networks, Markov networks and other graphical models are mentioned very briefly and the author says they are very big in ML right now, but he doesn't say why they didn't describe them further. It might have something to do with the organization of the book. Graphical models almost need a chapter of their own but the book's chapters discuss all techniques in one chapter but with varying levels of detail.	2005-10-09

I was disappointed.<br /><br />Jesse Sullivan's mother has amputated her own finger, and no one knows why or if she will mutilate herself again.  Jesse leaves her empty nest and her handsome pychiatrist husband and rushes back to the South Carolina island of her childhood and to the eclectic group of women that make up her mother's circle of friends.  While attempting to the discover the meaning behind her mother's actions, Jesse must face some issues of her own, primarily her instant attraction to Brother Thomas, a member of the island's monastery, seeking spiritual asylum after the death of his loved ones, the guilt she feels over her father's death and her own quest for her lost identity.<br /><br />Sounds entertaining and unsettlingly insightful, but instead, Kidd does not reproduce the nuanced yearning of the adolescent Lily of \\"Bees\\" as heard from a megaphone of experience, instead she creates a rather uncomfortable portrait of a woman unsure of herself and her place in the world on the many levels, of woman, mother, wife, daughter, artist, child, friend and lover--a rather sad commentary on suburban American life which isn't explored in all its possible complexities. None of Jesse's subsequent actions or revelations are necessarily earth-shattering, instead they seem almost unimportant and a waste of a reader's valuable time, making no real statement about life in general or 21st century life as 'Bees' did with regard to attitudes in the South during the Civil Rights Era or the delicate unfolding of a budding wonam's soul.<br /><br />More particularly, whereas the Calendar Sisters of \\"Bees\\" are rendered with a deft hand for character without being stereotypical, Nellies' longtime friends were too familiar as mundane parodies of the overly commericalized Ya-Ya sisterhood.  Unoriginal.  Again the character of Hepzibah could have wielded great literary power as the apex of all of the island's mysterious goings-on as symbolized by the Mermaid's Chair, instead, she is reduced to a mangled soliloquy on the beach in front of a canned fire without even uttering anything vaguely as memorable as a single 'Ya-Ya'.  How sad.<br /><br />Bottom line:  for me, this book only worked on the level of adequately describing the lush nooks and cranies of the Carolina low country set against the roiling of the grey Atlantic.  For a better portrayal of southern sensibilities, stick to the old masters: Faukner, Welty and Katherine Anne Porter.

In Polar Shift, he never even opens a door--or porthole, in this case--for a reader to do so. <br /> <br />The fact that Kurt Austin is no Dirk Pitt is part of the problem.  After all, why create characters who are vague images of much-better realized ones...distorted shapes in a flawed mirror of the writer's imagination?  Do we need Kurt and Joe when the originals work much better...And about whom we care, when they become involved in their adventures? <br /> <br />A deeper problems lies with the threat posed by the \\"mad\\" villain.  While polar shifts will be a real threat to the world security in perhaps 100,000 years, they are no threats today.  We have much more serious nightmares, including nuclear anihilation warfare or eco-disasters through global warming. <br /> <br />Without a believable and credible threat, Polar Shift never allows for the suspension of disbelief for the reader.  It just wanders on and on, with mundane scenes and dialogue, an unnecessary sub-plot involving an extraordinary scientific discovery, and no real physical or pyschological threats for our heroes. <br /> <br />Mr. Cussler should dump his writer and go back to what he does best:  Create more deeds of derring-do for Dirk and Al. <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

I read the criticisms from other readers and felt that they didn't understand the intention of the book.  They wanted an explanation of how to do EMDR, and this is a casebook of examples not a text.  If you want to understand how to do EMDR, you have to read the textbook by Dr. Shapiro that explains the procedures and protocols.  If you want to actually do EMDR, you have to take the class.  I did last year, and because I haven't practiced I am taking it again.  It's not something you want to try on your own.<br /><br />So, if you want examples of cases, read this book. If you want to know the protocols, get the textbook.  They are both good. Some of the cases are somewhat graphic in detail, but you get a better idea of \\"how\\" EMDR is used.  It is a good companion to the text.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd want a client to read this book, unless I'd carefully thought about how it would impact them.  These are not your run of the mill cases.  The majority of cases have suffered extremely horrific traumas to better illustrate how well EMDR can work.	2005-10-09

Not having read the other book, the first, in this series, it took me a little while to get into the characters depicted in Chris Bunch's novel.  Taking place in the distant future, the members of Star Risk, Ltd, a mercenary group, attempt to make money out of two warring groups in a part of the galaxy far, far away.  The plot starts out simple: the company is hired by one government to actually help them replace money into a bank that was stolen - the government used it for investment purposes without anyone knowing, and now has the money to repay its unofficial loan.  Unfortunately for Star Risk, what seems a simple job turns into a conflict between warring states, both of whom turn out to be corrupt and greedy for maln, a new consumer product that Alliance officials want to spread throughout the galaxy.  The plot has numerous twists and turns, and at times, it's hard to follow exactly what's going on.  The characters are fairly interesting, and it's nice to see two women as vital, leading characters. The most interesting character is Grok, a Chewbaca-like alien, who seems to really enjoy killing.  However, the battle scenes drag the book down, and I found I wasn't caring a lot about the fate of the main characters all that much.  Again, perhaps if I had read the other book in the series, I would have had a greater connection to the reality created by the author.	2005-10-09

SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THIS BOOK <br /> <br />From my view as a theorist and practicing evaluator of university quality and excellence, The psychology of abilities, competencies, and expertise, edited by Robert J. Sternberg and Elena L. Grigorenko, constitutes a first-rate, excellent book. Here are some reasons for this assertion: <br /> <br />1. The main goal of the book, \\"to characterize the nature of abilities, competencies, and expertice and to understand the relations among them\\", is fully achieved through out the ten chapters that comprises the book. <br /> <br />2. Each of the chapters provides an innovative contribution to the state of the art in the specific topic approached. Following are just a few examples. <br /> <br />Philip Ackerman and Margaret E. Beir, in chapter one, on trait complexes, cognitive investment, and damain knowledge, concludes with an extremely important implication for assessment and evaluation: \\"our view of intelligence is that the trait can more usefully be considered as representing \\"what an individual can do\\" in a way that encompasses both the solution of novel problems and the solution of problems with which the individual may have an extensive body of knowledge or developed expertise.\\" (p. 25) [Consequently], to serve society and by implication school in a more relevant way, measures \\"need to be developed that provide a more comprehensive assessment of what an indidivudual can do\\". (p. 26).  <br /> <br />K. Anders Ericsson, in chapter four, concerning theoretical implications from the modifiability and complexity of mechanisms mediating expert performance, concludes that \\"the analyses of expert performers in domains such as chess, music, and tennis show a qualitative difference in structure and complexity of the mediating mechanisms that such individuals use to progress to higher levels of performance.\\" <br /> <br />Dean Keith Simonton, in chapter eight, about expertise, competence, and creative ability, analyses the nature, definition, and implications of creativity as a psychological capacity. According to him, \\"creativity entails the capacity to generate ideas that are simultaneusly original and adaptive.\\" (p. 214), [However] \\"it is not a unique, psychological, phenomenon to be subsumed under a simple conceptual scheme [but] rather ... a complicated and dynamic mixture of various components, some innate and others experimental.\\" (p. 232). <br /> <br />Robert J. Sternberg, in chapter nine, concerning biological intelligence, analyses the most relevant biological approaches to intelligence, as well as the nature of adaptation to the environment. According to Sternberg,  <br /> <br />Biological intelligence refers to an organism's ability to adapt to the biological/physiical environment as measured by transmission of genes.... [However], biological approaches to intelligence have largely ignored this basic and singular fact, and have instead \\"attempted to account for (a) how humans among other species have reached the top of the existing evolutionary scale in intelligence or (b) biological mechanisms that account for individual differences in human intelligence (p. 253). [But], a central conclusion by Sternberg is that \\"humans may well be at the top of some evolutionary scale in terms of cultural intelligence. In terms of biological intelligence, they are, at best, middling. They have been responsible, directly or indirectly, for the extinction of a number of species. At the rate there are going, they may soon be responsible for the extinction of their own (p. 257).  <br /> <br />Finally, Richard  E. Mayer, in chapter ten, about what causes individual differences in cognitive performance, \\"provides a model of the determinants of individual differences in cognitive performance and show  how it relates to some of the proposed answers provided by the contributors to this book.\\" (p. 263). He concludes with the assertion that \\"additional research is needed to articulate more clearly the mechanism by which ability and experience interact to produce knowledge and the mechanism by which knowledge anables cognitive performance.\\" (p. 273). <br /> <br />On the basis of this review, I do recommend reading this book without omitting any of the chapters, as they all contribute in substantive and theoretical terms to give us an excellent overview of the state of the art concerning the topics approached. <br /> <br />Hernando Salcedo-Galvis  <br /> <br />*** <br />	2005-10-09

Get the book, read the stories, and prepare to turn your imagination on full blast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

Dr. Jeremiah gives practical advise for those who truly want to communicate with God.  He interprets the scriptures in simple terms, \\"Ask don't beg\\" \\"too busy not to pray\\" and also adds the dimension of his own experience dealing with Cancer.  He does not talk \\"down\\" to the reader, but takes him into his confidence and even inserts personal notes from his journal.He breaks down the \\"Lord's Prayer\\" into practical terms, showing us (the reader) how we can apply each area.   <br />This book is one, I feel, that cannot be read at one sitting, but should be taken showly, a chapter at a time, and \\"digested\\" <br />before preceeding to the next phase.  It is a book that could be  <br />read by a young person or a person of more mature years. It is a book that I will read again and again and would unhesitantly recommend to any \\"disciple\\".  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> . <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

It is an easy-to-read narrative about the real-life environment and adventures of the first pirates of the Caribbean - and it's written by a 17th-century buccaneer!  <br /> <br />The first part of the book concentrates on describing how the buccaneering lifestyle was established, as well as included an in-depth description of the flora and fauna of Tortuga and Hispaniola.  Having been to the Dominican Republic on Hispaniola, I really appreciated the rich detail and history of what the island was like in the 17th century.  I can't believe Hispaniola had so many animals back then - if you go there today, you'll find all the wildlife was killed for food long, long ago. <br /> <br />The second part of the book mostly covers the exploits of Henry Morgan, probably the most famous buccaneer of them all.  One of the fascinating chapters is about the sack of Panama, which includes all the hardships the buccaneers endured in order to pillage Spanish cities and fortresses. <br /> <br />This was a neat little book that kept my attention from chapter one onward.  I also stopped quite often just to read different passages aloud.  If you are going to travel to the Dominican Republic or Haiti, I'd recommend reading this book or taking it along as your \\"beach book.\\"  It's too bad there aren't really any touring trips to Tortuga, the infamous pirate haven that is referred to quite often in BUCCANEERS OF AMERICA, as it is nowadays an uninhabited island. <br /> <br />The only part of this book I didn't enjoy was the Introduction, which was pretty dry to read.  If you bypass it completely and just start with the first chapter, you'll be fine! <br /> <br />***Another fascinating pirate book to read is UNDER THE BLACK FLAG by David Cordingly.**** <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

My typical literary fare is not light stuff, so I don't think I was being too ambitious to undertake this book.  However, it turned out to be a laborious and heavy handed read.  I have nothing against metaphor and allegory, and I enjoy works that cause me to think.  But this one just wasn't the enjoyable read I had expected based on its popularity and hype.	2005-10-09

If you already own Home Comforts, I would skip Laundry (or if you must have it, wait until the paperback comes out, likely some time next year).  If, however, you don't care about food storage, bathroom cleaning, domestic employment laws, fireplaces, resilient flooring materials, \\"other components of household dust,\\" and you just want a well written, thorough, up-to-date guide to clothes and linens, then Laundry is a fine purchase, worth the current price.	2005-10-09

It was and it was much more. Eames deftly handles the bio-history of Christie, the juxtaposition of her trip 75 years earlier with his modern day experience, as well as giving very sharp insight into the people and history of today. I was especially interested, and surprised, to read his detailed accounts of traveling through the recently peaceful Balkans and the people he encountered. I had not expected that element of the travelogue and was intrigued by his experiences.  <br /> <br />Also of interest were his travels along what was the Taurus Express--the rail line that ran between Istanbul and Baghdad. These now mainly muslim countries that still held so much evidence of the imperialist occupation by European countries were of great interest to read about--especially given that many of those countries are not safe to travel.  <br /> <br />Christie's remarkably brave trek from London to Baghdad as a lone female in 1928 was equalled by Eames' much more hazardous trip on the brink of a major war.	2005-10-09

Kostova's descriptions of the landscape, while beautifully written, get old after the first 200 pages. The reader is left wishing she would just get to the answer of this vampire mystery already. The suspense of the unknown is only tempered by the belabored, wordy descriptions. Still, if you like Dracula, you need to read this book.

We are HUGE consumers of goods created both here and abroad.  <br /> <br />With \\"Fair Tax\\", at a flip of the calendar, every one of our expenditures will suddenly have a 23% (or more) Federal tax rate. Makes you stop and think before buying that new house or car, doesn't it?  <br /> <br />Regardless of whether companies will lower their product/services prices by the same amount (and by no means is that assured), it's still a large bump every time you spend on something. What happens if USA consumers suddenly stop partying at Wal-Mart like it's 1999?  <br /> <br />Many economists think we need to start saving more, but are worried that we actually might start saving more and drag the world economy into a depression. Scary thoughts, but the \\"Fair Tax\\" isn't concerned with scary thoughts. <br /> <br />In my mind, the bad things in this proposal are summed up by the nonsense buried at the end of the Fair Tax bill -- HR 25!	2005-10-09

The story revolves around the William Beckwith, a young gay aristocrat who is approached by the elderly Lord Nantwich to write his biography. As he learns about and unravels the mysteries of the life of Lord Nantwich, he realizes that the writing of the biography is an assignment he cannot accept. He is appalled by certain details of Nantwich's gay life and finds his emotions at conflict when he realizes that Lord Nantwich was put into prison by his very own grandfather, who led the anti-homosexuality efforts with the Home Secretary and British police. <br /> <br />Through the wittily crafted words of Allan Hollinghurst, we gain an insight into the psyche of gays and homosexuals. The writer exposes the promiscuity of homosexuals, who are often overwhelmed by lust and bodily desires. The happenings within public changing rooms, shower cubicles and gymnasiums, the one-off sexual escapades with strangers and the undercurrents in clubs and pubs introduce us to this group of individuals whom we know little about.  <br /> <br />Aptly named \\"The Swimming-Pool Library\\" because of the protagonist's role as the swimming pool caretaker in his school days, the book is a breakthrough for a novel of the 1980s. Though it contains some graphic descriptions of sexual encounters, the book's erotica is definitely not the focus of the story. It simply weaved into fiction the complexities of gay life in modern society. To accept or disapprove of gays? You decide. <br /> <br />Interestingly enough, when the book was first released in pre-AIDS London, it caused a stir among the readers. A decade and a half later, with cases of AIDS steadily increasing over the years, could the promiscuity of gays be put in the spotlight once again?  <br />	2005-10-09

Possessor of the title of Most High Academe by methods not quite orthodox, Vox is now a prisoner of his own machinations, his greatest triumphs usurped by those he once trusted.<br /><br />The hero of this book is again young Rook, the librarian-knight from book five.  Captured after losing his precious Stormhornet sky-craft while on patrol, he is sold into slavery and ends up in Vox's palace, as an assistant to Hestera Spikesap, an exciting new character with a lot going on in her kitchen and heart.  He meets the other minions of Vox - Speegspeel the goblin servant, Amberfuce the ghost-waif, and Flambusia, Amberfuce's nurse, and manages to get himself in the middle of most of the action which springs up in every chapter.<br /><br />Judging from the signs in the sky, a huge storm is brewing, which the Guardians of the Night believe will cure the stone sickness which has devastated New Sanctaphrax.  The natives are restless also, and it doesn't take much prompting to set Shrikes and Goblins against each other in a huge battle in the sewers beneath Undertown.<br /><br />There's more violence than usual in this one, and several mentions of the smell of unwashed bodies of various species.  It's also not as well thought out as the others, as major plot points happen too often by either chance or carelessness.  There are stories running concurrently that are sometimes hard to tie together, and lots of loose ends. There's even romance in the air along with the usual imaginative cast of creatures, but as usual, the illustrations truly bring the book to life.<br /><br />Not the best in the series, but packed with action and well worth reading.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 9, 2005	2005-10-09

It is very unusual to read either a Mob or a business book, and this book falls in both categories, that approaches its subject in that manner. <br /> <br />You practically have to go back to Jimmy Breslin, and his Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight, to find a less reverential view of the mob. The difference is that Breslin was working in fiction and this is a true story.  <br /> <br />In business, the only parallel is Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker, which of course delved into an entirely different side of Wall Street.	2005-10-09

After doing some research I made a trip to the mall and purchased The Wallflower, and I couldn't put it down.  The main character is a girl by the name of Sunako Nakahara, an anti-social \\"creature of the darkness\\" who loves nothing better than sitting in her room, watching American horror flicks (In chapter 1 you see her watching Friday the 13th) and talking to her anatomical dolls, Akira-kun, Josephine, and Hiroshi-kun. <br /> <br />Her aunt owns a gorgeous mansion, and offers four 15 yr old boys the chance of a lifetime- if they can turn Sunako into a proper lady they'll get to live in the mansion rent-free for three years.  Sounds easy, right?  Maybe not. <br /> <br />The overall quality of the art and translation was excellent.  They left all of the Japanese sound effects intact, and there's very little 'Americanization'.  There are many references to Japanese pop culture, and a translation guide in the back to explain jokes and translations that English-speaking readers might not understand.  It's reads right-to-left, like all good mangas should, and has a preview of the next chapter (in Japanese, not translated) in the back. <br /> <br />So, there's my two cents.  If you love unique, whacky mangas with a good balance of humor, romance, and maybe a bit of angst, this is definitely the way to go.	2005-10-09

In truth, they are NOT in it for the money, but must charge simply because they have to keep their doors open and continue to provide for the services they offer.

Kreeft's book is, on the whole, really quite good. Please be aware, however, of certain very troubling assertions found on *page 293*. (Kreeft himself has already expressed regret for his wording with respect to this issue.) Assuming the reader is aware of the content of said page, I proffer the following:<br /><br />Authentic Catholic orthodoxy holds that Christian belief with respect to the truth of the divine origin and infallibility of the Catholic Church has (/via/ the supernatural virtue of faith) every bit as much 'positive epistemic status' (to use Plantinga's term) as Christian belief with respect to the divinity of Christ. Indeed, at least as concerns the theological virtue of faith, the two stand or fall together. In other words, a Catholic may not hold that one has greater certitude with respect to one than the other: if one can be absolutely certain that one is not in error with respect to the truth of the divinity Christ, the same holds (by way of the same Christian faith) with respect to the truth of the divine origin and infallibility of the Catholic Church. From an authentically Catholic perspective, therefore, it is unorthodox (or at least misleading) to claim that Protestants \\"might be right after all\\". Kreeft's wording in this regard is apt to cause serious misunderstanding among already malinformed Catholics (not to mention the great mass of people as a whole) as to the nature of the supernatural virtue of faith.<br /><br />As an anecdote to the (as it were) \\"epistemic perils\\" of p. 293, I'd put forth for consideration Garrigou-Lagrange's ON FAITH (distributed by TAN), \\"Faith and Revealed Truth\\" by George D. Smith (found online, though be aware of a certain creeping evidentialism), and the portion of Frank Sheed's THEOLOGY AND SANITY (published by Ignatius) delineating the virtue of faith.<br /><br />Thus, aside from caveats with respect to both:<br /><br />a) page 293<br />*and*<br />b) certain \\"Rahnerian\\" 'anonymous Christian' tendencies evinced by Kreeft -- tendencies found in many otherwise superb Catholic works (springing, in large measure, from a *misinterpretation* of Vatican II),<br /><br />I'd recommend the cautious reading of this book. Its flaws notwithstanding, it remains a tremendous work of Christian and, specifically, Catholic apologetics.otherwise superb Catholic works (springing, in large measure, from a *misinterpretation* of Vatican II),    I'd recommend the cautious reading of this book.

With so many books and writers out there today finding anything fresh and intriguing can be difficult, but Box fits the bill. And Out of Range might be his best yet. The characters are tightly drawn and memorable. Each feels as though you have met them in life outside the book. Joe Pickett is the most compelling hero in fiction today. Pickett strives to do the right thing, but he is not perfect. He struggles with moral dilemmas as a Game Warden, as a husband, as a father, as a man. Pickett struggles with the same things we all do. It is very easy to relate to, and to root for Joe. Furthermore, Box's lean muscular style keeps the plot moving. Everything about this book, the characters, plot, descriptions, they all ring true. Out of Range is authentic and it is great.	2005-10-09

It begins harmlessly enough, with rather simple, obvious ideas, and seems the sort of textbook that there's no point reading and which accompany classes there is no point taking.<br /><br />It looks to be a logic textbook, but there's nothing about Ps and Qs and this set and that element, nor arcane symbols indicating what has a union with who. In fact, the opening examples are from Spinoza--just the sort of thing to interest a professional philosopher, and further reason for the casual student to put the book down. Later examples show the book's 1972 pedigree, and are drawn from women's liberation, rap sessions, the Kennedy assasination and rock music.<br /><br />Still no Ps and Qs, but now there's a bit on organization and making those horrible outlines they always suggest in English class before writing a paper. Except it's about over organization and how those outlines aren't the best way to get the gray matter going, and the exercises help you determine your writing and thinking style and what works best with your brain. Before you know it, you can also spot false ploys in advertising, the ad hominem and card stacking fallacies in arguments, and the relation between a premise and conclusion. Finally, like some drink sneaking up on you, all this leads into four chapters of Ps and Qs, also known as inductive and deductive reasoning.<br /><br />Some thirty years later, this 1972 paperback in the original Harper and Row edition shows its age. Harper and Row is now HarperCollins, Western Washington State College where Dr. Purtill taught long since became Western Washington University, and Charlie Brown is mispelled \\"Charley Brown.\\" A new edition would be welcome, but if some of the examples seem quaint, the book remains a relatively painless workout for the synapses and bulking up on the Ps and Qs.the synapses and bulking up on the Ps and Qs.	2005-10-09

Journalist Polly Toynbee does justice to the genre. She works mind-numbing jobs that pay just enough to keep her in poverty. She packages pastries and cleans hotel rooms, she lives in a squalid flat she can barely afford, and she tries to make ends meet on minimum wage. It is very depressing.<br /><br />Toynbee finds that being one of the working poor is to be defeated at every turn. When she gets her dark, damp, unfurnished flat, she has to borrow money from the Housing Authority to furnish it because she won't get paid until she has been working for at least two weeks. She can't make an appointment to see the doctor because her job doesn't allow any paid time off. She can't try to get a better job because all the employers want to schedule interviews during her work hours (and she can't afford to take time off) or they want her to devote the day to waiting for an interview. She can't even make her views as a voter known, because to get to the voting station would mean unpaid time off from work, or an hour on the bus and in line waiting to vote after a 10-hour shift on her feet.<br /><br />Life is a constant Catch-22 and she finally admits defeat when she has to move out of her apartment because the building's front door doesn't lock, there are drug dealers in the lobby, and she can't afford a phone.<br /><br />In between descriptions of her alternate life in the slum, she splices discussions of the politics behind the policies regarding wages and poverty in Great Britain. Even for someone who isn't familiar with British government, it is very clear. It is also obvious that we in America have a lot in common with Britain.	2005-10-09

No longer will she be your sole focus. The book has lots of netural colors,and there are beautiful photos of mom's, daughters, babies and toddlers. There are lots of sentences with fill in the blanks to make this book taylor made for your daughter to make her own. Because of the photos I think this is more for girls then boys. Maybe some day down the road the author will make a book for boys and maybe even a book for children who are getting a sibling through adoption.  <br /> <br />This book will help your child know that they are still special to you now & for always. A book they can go back to time and time again helping them processing everything that is going on to them, their mother and the newest member of their family.  <br /> <br />This book starts out taking about how our family is having a baby and how this book is special and just for she... Mommy's tiny big girl. It has a space for a current family photo. The book then moves on to talk about when they where born, how much they weighed, how many inches long you where and what things you liked to do as a baby. There is space for your child to add a photo of the two of you or if your child is old enough to draw a photos or drawings that can be pasted to that page. There is even a page for the new babies' ultrasound photo. It then goes on to talk about how big your mommy is going to get and how different your mommy will look. It then talks about how mommy will back a bag & will go to the hospital.It also tells your child that the doctors & nurses will take care of your mommy and new baby. As well as who you will stay with and what fun things you might do while you are together.  It talks about how you will be able to visit and meet your new sister or brother with a space for a  your siblings photo. What is also cute is a page where you talk about a name for the new baby and if your child had a chance to name the baby what she'd name her or him.The last several pages talks about what a baby does and there is a space for a photo of your daughter and her new sibling. <br /> <br />This is such a smart and wonderful book! A perfect shower gift for anyone who has a daughter. And here's hoping that the author will also creating a book for boys, and another for siblings who are getting a sibling through adoption.	2005-10-09
US	51406912	R2L1KEBNC65CD3	3423200553	583085887	Die Abenteuer des Röde Orm.	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Worth the Trouble it Takes to Find It!	Having heard so much about this saga-type novel I sought it eagerly and finally broke down and bought it via amazon uk (after a long, fruitless hunt stateside). Rather expensive for the copy I managed to secure (not the one featured on this page). And it had lots of typos and editing problems. But the book was worth it in the end. The tale of Orm Tostesson and \\"friends\\", it follows the adventures of this typical late tenth century viking through nearly all the high-points of vikingdom in the period. From raids and servitude on the coasts of Moorish Spain, to visits with Irish monks and dinner with the Danish King, Harald Bluetooth, and his assorted guests, including no less a worthy than Styrbiorn Olafsson, the Jomsviking and claimant to the Swedish throne about whom E. R. Eddison wrote so brilliantly in his own viking novel, STYRBIORN THE STRONG, this book takes us through all the paces. Orm ends up with a very noble wife living in a backwater part of Scandinavia (the borderlands between Sweden and medieval Denmark) but even there he gets no peace since his enemies and adventures pursue him. And in his maturity another and final adventure comes his way when he is summoned to the eastern reaches of far Gaardarike (the country that was to become Russia) to claim an \\"inheritance\\" of great value. Along the way, Orm makes some good friends, some bad enemies, participates in some (but by no means all) of the great events of viking history in that period, and finally mellows to become a better man who embraces the new way of thinking while yet feeling at home in the old.<br /><br />I did think the book a bit too episodic though this is no indictment of it since the sagas themselves are nearly always such and the \\"voice\\" smacks very much of the sagaman's art. However, a close reading makes this very clearly a modern novel for the humor is quite bracing and alone marks this tale out as one of ours and not one from an earlier time. I especially appreciated Orm's hypochondria, despite his courage in the face of battle, a very human and humorous touch! And the fighting is all very realistic, no great superhuman feats of derring do (except occasionally as we find in the real sagas). Some of the literary technniques used, besides the marvelous sense of tongue-in-cheek humor, are also quite contemporary. I did think the tale a bit slow in places, especially at the beginning, and rather more predictable than not.<br /><br />And, more, it is not, in my opinion the best of the viking or saga novels despite what others have said here. For tautness and action, none have yet done it better, in my opinion, than H. Rider Haggard with ERIC BRIGHTEYES. For the pure poetry of style, Eddison's STYRBIORN THE STRONG still has my vote. And for the resounding greatness of the tale and the power to move, no modern author has ever penned a better saga novel than Hope Muntz did with THE GOLDEN WARRIOR. But Bengtsson did a very nice job and deserves five stars for it. I take my hat off to him and to those here whose reviews obliged me to obtain and read this fine viking tale.<br /><br />By the way, there are a whole slew of good books out there for those into vikings and historical adventure, including a brand new one by Jeff Janoda called SAGA: A NOVEL OF MEDIEVAL ICELAND which details the events surrounding one of the most intriguing episodes in Eyrbyggja Saga (one of the most renowned of the original Norse sagas). It tells the story of a great feud between two chieftains over a little piece of forested land in an Iceland in which wood was as precious as gold. Other good ones include Cecelia Holland's very modern and psychological TWO RAVENS, a glimpse into the hot-house environment of an Icelandic farm, and Jane Smiley's THE GREENLANDERS which tells of the final days of the the Norse settlement in Greenland as the cold and Eskimos close in around the settlers. And if you still have any patience and want more, perhaps you'd want to try my own small effort, THE KING OF VINLAND'S SAGA, which I wrote to be the saga I'd always wished had been written and preserved about the Norse excursions to North America.<br /><br />All, I believe, are available in some form or another on-line.

The Final Solution includes the chapters Hitler's Pledge, Warnings And Forebodings, Britain's Dilemma, Evidence And Omissions, Rescue and Refuge, Eyewitness and This Bestial Policy. Part Two: Hope And Hopelessness includes Warsaw And Bermuda, The Spread Of Nazi Power and The German Occupation Of Hungary. Part Three: Auschwitz revealed, includes inter alia, Escape From Auschwitz, Zionism At Bay, The Deportations From Hungary, The End Of Auschwitz and the Epilogue.<br /><br />The book is painful to read as it chronicles the history of the Shoah from the earliest warnings of Hitler's intentions through the war, the doomed attempts of many individuals and organisations to rescue the Jews, the indifference and the excuses given by certain officials on the Allied side, and the actions, good and bad, of occupied and neutral countries. Although the book does not focus on personal experiences in the holocaust, there are some examples of unspeakable horror that the sensitive reader had best avoid.<br /><br />The author ascribes the extent of the tragedy and the failure to do more as failures of imagination, of response, of intelligence, co-ordination and of sympathy. To me the most shocking revelations are those where policymakers used the excuse that they were afraid of flooding Palestine and the UK with Jewish refugees. Or maybe even worse, those who claimed that the reports coming out of Europe were exaggerated. Another incredible show of indifference was the refusal of the Allies to bomb Auschwitz, while their planes were overflying the accursed place to drop supplies on Warsaw for the Polish uprising.<br /><br />Here and there one finds some glimpses of right action, for example Bulgaria, an Axis ally that nevertheless managed to protect its Jews from the worst. But overall, one is left with a feeling of utter despair at the way the events unfolded and the frustration that Zionist leaders must have endured in trying to help their doomed people. It is chilling to read how countries like Switzerland refused to accommodate refugees and how every obstacle was placed in the way of orphaned children trying to reach Israel. The world looked on and it still does. Since then, we have witnessed Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya and Darfur.<br /><br />The book contains 16 pages of black and white plates and 20 maps. It concludes with biographical notes and a thorough index. For more information and background on the horror and the indifference, I recommend [[ASIN:0060915331 A History of the Jews]] by Paul Johnson and [[ASIN:1859842291 The Contract of Mutual Indifference: Political Philosophy After the Holocaust]] by Norman Geras.

Prior to this novel, I read several of her courtroom novels, and although they were excellent reads, I needed a break from the format.  Picoult's writing is drenched with rich, realistic characters for which readers humanistically identify, and Harvesting the Heart is her writing at is best minus the suspense-dominated drama.  The book is a fantastic read.<br /><br />Nicolas and Paige, the two primary characters and the points of view from which the narrative is told, are superbly drawn and complex.  Both Paige and Nicholas' flaws are very humanistic and identifiable.  The reader has no choice but to empathize, hate, celebrate, and scold each as the narrative unfolds.  Even the more static characters such as Astrid and Robert Prescott are believable.<br /><br />The story does not lead you on a \\"whodunit\\" trail.  Instead, it pleasantly unfolds the love story of a man and woman from different circumstances - two humans who find each other and, through human flaw, nearly lose out on life's finest treasures.<br /><br />The book is a very worthwhile read that holds you entranced in Picoult's pleasantly artistic yet simple prose.	2005-10-09

Not to *!SPOIL*! anyone's enjoyment of the book, if anyone is still reading this old thing, but it seems to be the story of a family of demon-possessed firstborn children who are cursed by Judas Iscariot in the time of Christ. Over the centuries, they make their way to a remote mountain location in America, where they intermarry, breed, and feud with a family of werewolves. What exactly this cursed family is capable of, or what they are, is never explained, and the story of the werewolf family is never explained either. The book is too short to go into detail about either family, and not much is very frightening about it. There are a couple of creepy scenes involving a sister who disappeared over two decades ago, but that's about it. The ending is not very satisfying, and the whole story is rather pointless. It's an okay way to kill a few hours, though, so I guess it isn't a complete waste of time. Well, that's my opinion, hope it helps.	2005-10-09

His only negative comment when I gave it to him was, \\"That is a dagger on the cover!\\" and He knows his knives!! I guess the publisher doesn't know what a bowie knife looks like.  If you like bowie knives or know someone who does, this is a perfect book.	2005-10-09

It has two main points of view: From below, because the writer does not give us the bird's view, foolish, superficial and immature that many tourists get and then spread in their countries. Those tourists, visitors and \\"friends of the revolution\\" go to Cuba for cheap pleasures, young prostitutes and, in some cases, for almost-slave labor for their hotels and \\"foreign\\" enterprises in the beautiful island-prison.  <br /> <br />     From inside, because this is neither the \\"official\\" Cuban government interpretation nor the exile's viewpoint that has in many cases lost touch with the Cuban reality within the island. The book contents are objective, honest and verifiable. The author is a bit naive at times, as when he thinks Castro, a dictator already 46 years in power, is still trying to do what he thinks is right. No!!! Castro is just desperately trying to cling to power, his Mercedes Benz fleet, his personal yatchs and his many mansions all through the island. He knows very well that average Cubans live from hand to mouth and from day to day. Proof of that is the 80 workers, humble people that were put in prison in 2003 for the terrible crime of trying to \\"inform\\" foreign journals and magazines of the terrible situation in Cuba. Proof is also the three young black kids that tried to highjack a boat to the US and, with the assistance of some French tourists, were captured and executed by the Cuban authorities in less than 72 hours. Proof is in the tens of thousands of Cubans that risk their lives in the treacherous, shark-infested waters of Florida Strait to try to set foot on US coasts or any other country that may grant them asylum. Proof lies in the thousands of dissidents who populate Castro's terrible jails and prisons. <br />     Castro is neither a product of the US short-sighted foreign policy nor the former Soviet imperialism: He is a product of his own delusions, megalomania and craving for power. He is like a littleStalin or Hitler with nowhere to escape to. He has to die in Cuba and so he will, for the release and peace of mind and heart of over 13 million Cubans, spread all over the world!  <br />     Very good book, Mr. Corbett!	2005-10-09

Every dish I have made from here has always generated praise at parties or dinners. People think I am a great cook, when really all I do is follow these recipes well. I like this cookbook because it does not demand fancy, expensive, complicated or exotic ingrediants, its simple foods prepared simply well. Every recipe is a winner from meats to cookies to veggies. Also there are substitution charts on the back inside cover (very handy when on a budget in college) and measuring charts. Also it gives the advice on refridgeration expiration dates for meats and cutting techniques. Plus it gives meat safety temperatures, which is good when you are roasting a chicken or pork. I highly recommend this and whenever I see this cookbook at someones house, its always a topic of conversation since its has great recipes and solid reference charts.	2005-10-09

I have to say I disagree with it. The biography does not necessarily focus on all his Beebe's personal issues, but it is a vibrant and gripping read about a very unique man. I thought it was extremely well done. <br /> <br />Born in the last quarter of the nineteenth century in Brooklyn, it was still a world of forests and wildlife nearby for him to explore. This love of nature, and comfort away from the trappings of civilisation stayed with him all his life. But he also had this almost supernatural ability to dissociate himself from his possible fate - or even his reality and instead go beyond that to look at what was happening around him. So his observations were extraodinary.  <br /> <br />He was the first person to be travel down to 2000ft in the ocean in a small metal capsule. The enormous pressures could have caved in the tiny craft - it did even start leaking at some stage. Yet he broadcast live from it, and managed to make some ground breaking observations about his time there and the strange animals which dwelt there - some of which have never been seen since.  <br /> <br />Gould has divided this biography into four distinct sections which followed his life, Naturalist, Ornithologist, Marine Biologist and Tropical Ecologist.  <br /> <br />this is illustrated throughout with printed pictures on each page, the only drawback is that these pictures are all of poor to fair quality -  a problem of matt paper combined with size of pictures and that they are all in black and white. <br /> <br />Beebe's life is worth reading about and I think Gould's biography is an excellent reference, readable and engaging.	2005-10-09

But the truth is, we, as humans, do not have all the answers.  We are lost, confused, and often very doubtful.  In Blue Like Jazz, Donald Miller shows these feelings in his life.  Instead of hiding insecurites and doubt he opens them up, so that we can see that there are people who feel the same way we do - that being a Christian, doesn't mean you have to be perfect.  Miller also shows that we don't just become Christians, and that's it.  He shows that it is something that we work at everyday, and that there will always be something more that we need to do.  It is a beautiful book, and I would reccomend it to Christians and Non-Christians, alike.	2005-10-09

While his own experience is mainly in fencing, he also incorporates the work of other sports photographers in his book, which according to the introduction, is aimed at every photographer except full time professional sports photographers.  The book is divided into four main parts. Understanding digital sports photography includes a general introduction, a section about workflow and a discussion of equipment and techniques.  Shooting sports on location groups the approach to different sports depending on their venue.  Working in the digital studio discusses the requirements for digital processing and processing techniques.  A section on presentation talks about everything from printing through earning money from your photographs to legal issues.<br /><br />I found the section on shooting sports on location the most useful.  For example you can turn to the chapter on indoor competition sports and find a number of hints that may prove useful in such a venue.<br /><br />Unfortunately, other parts of the book are less useful.  While the author is undoubtedly a good photographer, his organizational skills as a writer are weak.  He will repeat the same advice over and over.  For example on a single page he will ask \\"[W]hat if you inadvertently click the wrong setting and delete all the photos..?\\" and then a few sentences later say \\"Don't be in a hurry.  More than one photographer has deleted a card without meaning to....\\"<br /><br />He often gives wrong advice.  For example, he states that you cannot upgrade from Photoshop Elements to the full blown Photoshop.  Yet for some time now, and as of the date of this writing, Adobe has given a $100 discount to Photoshop Elements owners on the purchase of Photoshop.  He also gives contradictory advice.  On one page he recommends establishing a digital darkroom with \\"a good-quality monitor, preferably the CRT kind, not an LCD display.\\"  A few pages later he says \\"a good quality LCD will be perfectly sufficient.\\"<br /><br />His discussion of digital processing could have been limited to a discussion of some of the possibilities of Photoshop.  Instead he provides just enough instruction to confuse any would-be user.<br /><br />But the biggest problem is that he leaves out the discussion of factors that are important to new digital photographers.  For example, one of the tools that separates film from digital in the control of exposure is the in-camera histogram.  Yet there is no mention of the facility until the chapter on darkroom processing and then it is given short shrift.<br /><br />For another example, digital cameras shoot in various formats like Raw and JPEG, which is not as flexible for post-processing as Raw but creates smaller picture files.  Digital cameras store picture files in a buffer before they write the data to a memory card.  When the buffer is full, the camera will not take a photograph.  For this reason sports photographers, who often shoot in long bursts, prefer JPEG so that they can store more pictures in the buffer.  Timacheff does not even suggest that this might be a reason for selecting JPEG over Raw.<br /><br />If you purchase this book for the tips on shooting in sports locations, you may find it useful.  Otherwise, you will probably be disappointed.ality LCD will be perfectly sufficient.\\"    His discussion of digital processing could have been limited to a discussion of some of the possibilities of Photoshop.

I finally got around to reading a book that's been talked about a lot in blogging circles...  Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell.  I found it fascinating, and it certainly explains a lot of things that I've often wondered about...<br /><br />The main question here is what happens in those first couple of seconds when you observe something?  Without often knowing why, you make some snap judgements that can often be extremely accurate.  But when asked to explain why you felt that way, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint the correct reasons.  This process of decision-making is called \\"thin-slicing\\", and it's the stripping away of various inputs that don't end up affecting the outcome of your decision.  If faced with 100 items of information about a decision, it's often just a small handful of items that consistently predict success or failure.  The subconscious can often find those points and sift out the pattern without us being able to know why.  Experts in a field, due to their exposure to the subject, can thin-slice even more quickly.  They stand a better chance of being able to explain the \\"why\\" behind it, but even then it's somewhat iffy.  Once you're aware of the thin-slicing phenomenon, you can start to accept it as a valid way to aid in the decision-making process.<br /><br />It wasn't covered in the book, but an application of this is something I've always found irritating in sports broadcasts.  You have color commentators taking a play and dissecting the smallest movements in the players, explaining how each one made conscious decisions to shift the hips here or move the arm there.  In reality, there's little conscious decisions made at all.  The players are really thin-slicing the situation based on their past experiences, and making split-second reactions.  The more experience and practice, the better the thin-slicing.  All the extraneous action and information is stripped away, and the things that matter are handled instantaneously.  If this type of thinking was more well-known, color commentators could be out of a job...  :)<br /><br />Definitely worth reading and pondering.  You may not agree with Gladwell, but it will force you to think about things...ntaneously.

Up till that point the author writes a endearing, mature romance about two older (30's) characters who've been hurt by past loves and are realistically flawed because of it. The author then goes a bit wanky with her writing-having both the hero and heroine behaving so outlandishly you'll be wondering if you're reading the same book:)<br /><br />The book does have a happy ending-and the writing is at least above average. The love scenes are mild, to moderately erotic at the end.The hero, Simon, a man who was entrenched in  women's rights issues-a hero before his time, and a true romantic-ya gotta love him!<br /><br />Overall, a pleasant read and I'll be trying more of this author's books. 4 stars!	2005-10-09

Ignorance is just plain ignorance, and ignorance regarding the income tax code is costing Americans billions of dollars each year. This ignorance is by design. Title 26 of the US Code, the income tax code, is an indecipherable mishmash of double speak. If you do not believe this, simply read Title 26 and then any of the other parts of the US Code and you will be immediately struck by the differences. This is done purposefully to keep the tax code as confusing as possible. What other possible explanation can there be but to keep you in the dark about the truth regarding the income tax laws?  <br /> <br />Peter Hendrickson has taken on the task of deciphering the double speak and laying it out in plain English for all to understand.  In my humble opinion, he has done a remarkable job. His book, Cracking the Code: The Fascinating Truth About Taxation in America explains the tax code in a very clear, easy to grasp manner. This is not a \\"scheme\\" to avoid paying taxes and you will not find Mr. Hendrickson advocating not paying one's fair share. He does however point out how the tax code is by design very limited in its scope, and how this is disguised by the double speak.  <br /> <br />As with anything, we are all ultimately accountable for our behavior based on the conclusions at which we arrive. Thankfully, Mr. Hendrickson has provided an invaluable tool to help all of us make our decisions in an educated, informed manner. I give this book my highest recommendation.	2005-10-09

This is the seminal work on the poor in America, analyzed within the context of government proffered, anti-poverty programs. It is a scathing critique and analysis of the war on poverty, where bold rhetoric and political grandstanding have often supplanted action. The author in his analysis categorizes poverty as a cultural and often institutional way of life that would require radical innovations, social planning, and long term financial investment, were the government really serious about eradicating poverty in America. What is amazing is that the arguments made by the author, when he wrote this book forty years ago, are still sound today.	2005-10-09

This is another collection of delightful boxes which includes my favourite octagonal design.  She shows you in this book how to work the same design so that it has five, six, seven or eight sides as you wish and how to make suitable bases which will always fit your box.  There is a nice variety of designs including simple little \\"docking boxes\\".<br /><br />Miss Fuse's boxes often look quite delicate but aren't at all - considering they are made from several sheets of paper slotted together they are remarkably strong and I have had a number on my desk at work acting as receptacles for various items for some years without mishap.<br /><br />Care is required in the folding and the boxes are not for the complete beginner.  Anyone starting to make them should at least have mastered the basic models in any beginner's book and then the boxes will be relatively easy though that final sheet is always fiddly to maneouvre into place.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys origami as I have come back to it again and again over several years and still enjoy folding from it.	2005-10-09

The father Lord Tellan is elated though dazed at becoming a first time father.  However as the Loreteller Girard begins to scribe the birthing information on parchment, monks from the Keepers of the Covenant surprise everyone when they arrive to predict the newborn babe would become the Protectoress of the Covenant and bring affluence to the land.  However, the elderly monk tries to kill the baby; after quite a struggle he dies, but not before he murders Eyslk.<br /><br />Just under sixteen years later, her home is in fiery ruins as dragons take to the sky to stop the prophecy from happening so that they can rule the Broken Stone Lands from the sky, They must kill Rhiannon as the only potential threat.  Her tutor Lakenna has taught her more than just book knowledge.  Only a teen, she is the one person who can enter the spirit plane to weaken unbeatable dragons and their even more invincible evil masters(demons) so that they can be harmed by master sword fighters and archers on the mortal plane.  She is the red haired DAUGHTER OF PROPHECY, but has a long weary quest to meet what has been foretold about her since birth.<br /><br />This is an extremely exciting fantasy that opens at a fevered pitch and never slows down until the concluding battle occurs with the above paragraphs only describe the beginning of Rhiannon's geas.  The cast is strong enabling the audience to believe in dragons, demons and wars on a spiritual plane.  Readers who enjoy good vs. evil confrontations will appreciate Rhiannon's tale, sort of like Saint Joan and the Dragon.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-10-09

My husband died in 2003; we had been married forty-five happy years and I was certainly not ready to become a widow.  We have four grown children and much for which to be grateful; but it was a very difficult time for me.  THIS book was shared with me by a friend who had to bury one of her own adult children after a tedious illness.  Somehow this little book had just the right words to help me through this sorrowful time of my life.  I have shared it with others and hope that it brings them the same joy and relief that it did me.  In reality, there is very little a person can say to you that helps (at least for me) but this profound small book gave me great insight and help in dealing with living my life as a widow.

I don't understand why Amazon says this program is \\"Out of Print\\" as it is new and readily available. This is the only program in the global marketplace that gives you the mental software to optimize work and life.  I started the audio-CD program as a mediocre positive thinker. Optimal Thinking is now my dominant thinking level. I no longer have to consciously consider optimal choices because choosing the best option in any circumstance is now instinctive. I use Optimal Thinking to set goals, make decisions, resolve negative emotions, and in my verbal and written communications at home and work.  The CD's are fun and informative, and you integrate the information into your life with action steps every day. What I like most is that you don't just go to the next level.  You really do integrate living life at the level of \\"what is in your/our best interest\\" no matter what you are faced with.  My organization began implementing the Optimal Thinking program for the employees in our department six months ago as a pilot program. It was so successful that the managers are now going through the program.

This was 1985.  From that point forward, all comics that approach this level of script and art can pay nothing but homage to Miller and Mazzucchelli.  Most attempts have been but poor imitation; the truly good ones must acknowledge their indebtedness to this collaboration.<br /><br />As a collection, this book succeeds on so many levels.  Miller's technique of using internal monologue to insightfully reveal the characters is now much imitated but was revolutionary in those days.  Its skillful use underlines here the terrible isolation of Matt Murdock/Daredevil and Wilson Fisk/Kingpin.  In the first chapter, \\"Apocalypse\\", the Kingpin learns that Matt Murdock is Daredevil and systematically deconstructs Murdock's professional, financial and personal life.  Kingpin reflects that Murdock is \\"an efficacious opponent...Still I am not satisfied...I should leave him to the misery that awaits him.  I must deny myself the exquisite pleasure of a killing stroke...\\"<br /><br />Later, as Matt Murdock retrieves his Daredevil costume from the rubble of his destroyed apartment, Murdock thinks, \\"I never would have connected it to you.  Nothing about it said gangster --- until this.  It was a nice piece of work, Kingpin.  You shouldn't have signed it.\\"<br /><br />Later still, in \\"Pariah!\\", the Kingpin arranges for an \\"accident\\" for Murdock.  Weeks later, the crime scene is discovered but to the Kingpin's consternation \\"There is no corpse.  There is no corpse.\\"  The man he thought he'd murdered is alive.  \\"And I ----I have shown him...that a man without hope...is a man without fear.\\"<br /><br />Miller's pacing is breathtaking.  Not a word is wasted, there is no filler.  In the wrong hands, the appearance of the Avengers would have been a stunt; here, it is a thrilling plot device, with a depth of insight offered about Captain America that is unexpectedly fulfilling.  Yes, it's a story about costumed superheroes, so there are fight scenes, skillfully plotted and staged...<br /><br />Which brings me to the art.  David Mazzucchelli (two Z's, two C's, two L's, thank you very much) matches Miller here, stroke for stroke.  Hyperbole or no, his effort here is genius.  (Miller actually has the most cogent analysis:  in the Afterword of this edition, he writes that Mazzucchelli \\"creates actors whose dramatic range is startling, whose best and most compelling moments are wordless.\\")  Throughout, he expands the genre of panel art, using the page in ways little seen before (but oft-imitated now, as is Miller's scripting).  His innovative composition blows up the panels on occasion, ignoring the tightly prescribed limitations of the typical comics page.  He uses narrow horizontal panels to terrific effect, as motif.  The fight scenes are some of the best you'll ever see; check out the fight in Ben Urich's apartment.  It's brutally visceral: the change-up is that it's between a hulkingly violent nurse and Matt Murdock!  This is but one example.  The art is so skillful, so detailed, that panel-for-panel, it is some of the best you'll ever see.  (I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the incredible work of the colorists, Christie Scheele and Richmond Lewis.)<br /><br />My favorite panels are the six full page ones that serve as the title pages for each chapter.  Five of the six are views from above and exemplify the Biblical motif used throughout.  The cover of the paperback edition is stunning; the stained-glass in the background is nothing short of beautiful, and cleverly executed to boot.  A treat for those of us, like me, who have read and re-read this brilliant story dozens of times.<br /><br />Remember that Mazzucchelli's resum&eacute; includes both \\"Born Again\\" and \\"Batman: Year One\\".  Right after you finish reading \\"Born Again\\", buy the other.  I envy you if you haven't read either of them yet.  You are in for a truly transcendent experience.t.

It may be, in its \\"milder\\" forms, as that experienced by Dawn Prince-Hughes, who writes so beautifully well, an attempt to adapt to an ancient environment in which social abilities are not as valuable as some other talents.  Many autistics would be more at home in the jungle or in woodlands or on the savannas of Africa than non-autistic people.  Their ability to concentrate and to sense things acutely would serve them well.  And any lack in social skill would not matter.<br /><br />At least that is my impression after reading this wonderful book by a woman who \\"went forward by going backwards\\"--backwards, that is, \\"into the most primal and ancient part of myself.\\"  She had this experience with her \\"first and best friends, a family of captive gorillas, people of an ancient nation.\\"<br /><br />On the other hand, the autistic spectrum of disorders may represent imperfect ways of dealing with the world and with others.  Usually autistic people are at a disadvantage, especially socially and vocationally, because other people find their behavior inappropriate and unfeeling.  Dawn's behavior seemed at times cold and withdrawn and without proper affect.  She had to force herself to make eye contact with people and to remind herself to engage in the social niceties.  The curious thing about this is that autistics may actually feel things more strongly than the rest of us.  The lack of social grace that many autistics display does not mean they are incapable of feeling or that their feelings of love and empathy are less than that of \\"normal\\" people.  Clearly we can see in this memoir that Dawn has always been a deeply caring person with a great capacity for love.<br /><br />The problem for some autistics is that they feel things too deeply.  Many autistics have senses that are so acute that everyday interactions with other people overwhelm them emotionally.  Satchel Paige famously said that \\"the social ramble ain't restful.\\"  He was, in understatement, expressing what Dawn has always felt.<br /><br />As a child Dawn could repeat conversations verbatim and had a \\"vast repertoire of commercial jingles\\" which she would sing.  She loved repetition and symmetry, and later as an adult learned from her gorilla friends \\"the value and beauty of ritual.\\"<br /><br />She had sensory addictions, as she calls them, to various sights and sounds and tactile sensations.  She craved salt and would eat it straight from the shaker; and she would suck on burnt matchheads and \\"craved Alka-Seltzer for its taste and feel.\\"  She loved to smell her grandparents' car and her grandmother's purse.  She felt a sense of calm and security in the presence of familiar things.  Away from the familiar, she became frightened and insecure.  She liked to hide in caves and other places away from people and from the \\"chaos of noise\\" all about her.<br /><br />After a horrendous childhood in which she was abused by peers at school, and an adolescence and young womanhood in which she was often homeless and terribly alone, she found a sense of love and belonging by watching and interacting with gorillas at the zoo.  She herself became a gorilla in part, and refers to her kin throughout the book as \\"people.\\"  This of course is part of the political and moral message of the book: the great apes are \\"people,\\" or at least they should be treated as people and not as inferior animals to be enslaved and experimented upon.<br /><br />Prince-Hughes's experience with the gentle and peaceful gorillas marked the beginning of her transformation from hopeless misfit to instructor at Western Washington University with a PhD in anthropology.  It also helped that she came to understand that she is autistic, and came to accept that she is different from other people.  From that understanding she came to realize that she had to consciously make adaptations to better fit in with others, and to make allowances for what they expected and considered proper even though for Dawn some of their expectations were strange and needless.<br /><br />This is a fascinating, honest, and deeply revealing memoir about what it is like to be autistic.t she had to consciously make adaptations to better fit in with others, and to make allowances for what they expected and considered proper even though for Dawn some of their expectations were strange and needless. <br /> <br />This is a fascinating, honest, and deeply revealing memoir about what it is like to be autistic.	2005-10-09

Including the book that started this series, \\"Irish Thoroughbred\\".  I LOVED that story, but I have to say that I was a little let down by this story.  It is the story of Dee and Travis's daughter Keeley.  She is all grown up and makes a living owning and teaching children how to ride horses.  She is very independent in this story and I like her way of thinking, (some of her comments on her relationship with Brian are very funny and made me laugh a lot).  Brian is Travis's new horse groomsmen.  He replaces Paddy at the beginning of the story.  He is a loner and wants to stay that way.  I loved reading about his \\"gift\\" with the horses.  It is beautiful the way he relates to them in this story.   <br />     This is a really great book to read if you aren't looking for a lot of romance.  The story line was very entertaining and the scenery was beautiful.  There was NOT a lot of romance though and I don't like books where the woman chases after the man. I like books where the man chases after the woman.  Brian didn't want anything but sex from Keeley right up until the end of the book.  After she is threatend by a jerk in the stables.

It's straight, mercifully free of purple prose and self indulgence (which is a paradox in the world of 'blogging).  I finally got a chance to devote a whole evening to this book after sneaking it into work only to shun lunchtime shmoozing to read it at my desk.  Let me tell ya the signifance I drew from this book: Had it been written 20 years from now, something would have been lost in the impact of looking at the world knowing this is happening RIGHT NOW to the kid that just graduated high school, your neighbour's spouse, and some child's parent.  I found Buzzell's book to be dichotomous in the laugh-out-loud hilarity and sobering depictions, freedom and censorship, and most of all his painting a picture so that you THINK you might know what it's like and realizing how deeply you will never know what it's like unless you were there and have a \\"shoebox\\" with a lid closed tight.  I'm glad I got the hard back because this will be a book I will thumb again and place alongside \\"Fields of Fire\\"(James Webb), \\"Guns Up\\"(Johnnie Clark) and \\"COPS: Their Lives in their Own Words\\"(Mark Baker)	2005-10-09

Ehrenreich had much more of an agenda going into this book than she did with her previous hit and I think that is what damaged her attempt to research middle-class workers.    The corporate world is intricately complex. And she didn't get far enough to enter it, so it is difficult to believe that her conclusions after her research are fair.     Instead of attempting an executive PR position (this is laughable, there are so few executive PR positions her chances of being hired in a good economy would've been slim) she should've just tried out for an administrative assistant position to an executive or a human resources position.     Also, Ehrenreich didn't research her own false identity enough to make her story plausible. Suggesting that a car wash company needs PR is a dead giveaway of an amateur. A well-seasoned Public Relations rep knows the difference between sales and PR. Ehrenreich made it clear to the car wash owner she doesn't by suggesting that car wash companies need someone to explain their purpose to the public and to mediate questions from the media about issues facing the car wash industry. What was she thinking???    One good point she makes though, is that people with non-scientific and non-technical degrees are basically being washed out of the job market. This is a terrible trend and a terrible mistake- creative people are the ones with the innovative ideas and can make the workplace dynamic and more enjoyable. She also points out the disturbing trend of frequent lay offs of educated, qualified workers.    Unfortunately, these points are lost in the scope of a book that isn't thorough and wasn't well planned.	2005-10-09

Because there is A LOT to read. It's a hefty book.  <br /> <br />It's in three sections, so you can skip to the part you want to read about. Personally, I prefer the song chapters. You can dip in and out of it because each song is written about seperately. And you can see how important the song is by how much he writes about it.  <br /> <br />Hey Jude, for example, gets a couple of pages all to itself, whilst others will only get a paragraph. Each version of Revolution gets a page on its own, so all three songs together span a few pages - which is a lot to write about a single song. And then what makes the book great, is that it doesn't end there. He writes about it again in the Hey Jude British single (because Revolution was the B-side), and also the American single -- and he also includes some material about it in the history section -- when he discusses how John got into politics. He even lists the revolutions that occured around the time that he wrote it. <br /> <br />So there is lots of varied information there, all shared out between the history, song, and record sections - that is where a better index would have come in handy. But if you want to learn the whole story of The Beatles, and go behind the stories of all of the songs, then check it out.	2005-10-09

The odd think about conspiracy theorists is how they build layer after layer of 'proof' on spurious sources - a house of cards of inference based, in the long run, on myth, hallucination, and too much moonshine. Michael Barkun does an excellent job of debunking the conspiratorial mindset and showing how this false layer of belief has been used to support many of the atrocities of apocalyptic thinking and behaviour. <br /> <br />Barkun's theses are simple presentations of the lack of any concrete proof behind the rambling raciocinations of the paranoid minority.  And that, if anything, it is the ethnophobic radical right which has seized on fevered imaginings like those of F. A. Ossendowski to further agendas that would be inconceivable except in the context of a terrified fear of God's final reckoning.   <br /> <br />Barkun uses good sense toblow back the dark clouds of conspiracy.  This is a breath of fresh air.  One can't help but wonder if the world would be a saner place if more people read enough of books like these to maintain a health scepticism when dealing with apocalyptic fantasies.	2005-10-09

What I didn't expect was the small section on Youth and Maiden Lovemaking, and the irresponsible advice it touted.  Written by a 14-year old (which is surprising enough) who obviously has no idea what he's talking about, it opens with \\"A lot to being a Pagan is being a good lover.  My attitude is, why not start sooner than later?\\"  This child is 14!  Our kids are already out there experimenting at early ages, and now we have this boy promoting that?!  Next he talks about STDs - \\"You may hear about STDs, and the fact is, the *only* way to prevent STDs are condoms and outercourse.\\"  Uh, no...the *only* way to fully prevent an STD is abstinence, but since that is not a realistic way to think, why not say that condoms will *protect* you from STDs, but not always *prevent*, so make sure you use them correctly and responsibly.  And you can't get an STD from \\"outercourse\\"?  Really?  I think this kid needs to go back and do his homework on this one.   <br /> <br />It's a shame, because up until this point, this chapter was really beautiful and informative, but by throwing in this drivel it managed to take away from the previous good advice and end this chapter on a negligent and dangerous note. <br />	2005-10-09

At least some of it. I watch each and every episode of Survivor and The Amazing Race. I've tuned into portions of The Bachlorette, The Mole and Big Brother (I didn't like that one at all). So when the book, So You Wannabe On Reality TV by Jack Benza hit my desk, I picked it up and began reading it immediately.     Whew! This is the book to read if you want to be on TV. I've decided that it is definitely not for me because I'm just too high maintenance and I don't want all of my flaws to be aired on national television. I can't take the humiliation! And I enjoy anonymity far too much. Oh, and my mother really, really loves me and I'd like to keep it that way.    Benza has experience with \\"reality\\" TV and shares his experience of participating in over thirty reality, dating, and game shows. He's also produced audition tapes for other \\"wannabe contestants.\\" He discusses the application traps, audition tapes, personal interviews, physical and mental tests and everything else connected to reality TV in a clear and straight-forward, no-holds-barred manner. And it's not always pretty.    If you want, really want, to break into reality TV, this just might be the book for you. It might also deter you from following that path, and even Benza would say, don't do it unless you're willing to play a part, be humiliated and suffer other \\"things\\" at the hands of the producers.    Armchair Interviews says: This book is not only helpful in navigating the reality TV path, but it is both a funny and scary look at this new phenomenon.	2005-10-09

In reading the newspaper headlines in this book, if you did not know which storm they were writing about, it would be hard to tell the difference between the two. I suppose the old saying, the more things change, the more they stay the same, at least in this particular instance, is true. I read Jacob's Storm, but this book is told in first person narative which makes the similarities all the more strange. Although Katrina was a horrible storm, the hurricane which struck Galveston in 1900, and the devestation, and deaths it caused, makes Katrina look puny by comparison. No one knows what category storm hit Galveston simply because they didn't grade storms at that time, but all guesses I have read said it was most certainly a cat 5. <br /> <br />This is a great book for those who wish to make comparisons between Katrina, and the unnamed storm which struck Galveston.	2005-10-09

My daughter and I both read it.  I found the characters to be engaging and real.  As I began to read, I too was going along for the adventure; sensing danger, facing fear, laughing at times, enjoying certain characters, while loathing others.  I pictured myself wielding a sword doing battle with Kirilin, ogres and draconians.  I felt the coldness of Icereach and wondered what lard would feel like on my face in order to protect my skin from such extreme temperatures.  At sea, on a ship--could I have stitched up Icefire's wound after the battle with Kirilin.  What inner strength would I have in the use of magic for either good or bad?  This is a book you can experience and enjoy. <br /> <br />There is plenty of action and adventure as Icefire leads Nearra, her sister Jirah, and friend Davyn on a journey to restore magic to Nearra's family.  Davyn and Icefire clash at every turn, while Jirah's feelings of jealousy over Nearra lead them down a path of danger.  You'll also meet Keene and his dog Pip.  They are Icefire's companions.  Keene is funny and a bit of a trouble maker, but loyal nonetheless.  As for Icefire, he's my favorite.  For me, he's the wild card (a charmer, rogue, adventurer and risk taker). <br /> <br />I loved this book because the characters and story were made real for me.	2005-10-09

It reads something like a decent academic text for someone who hasn't any notion of how to write a story at all, and needs enough of the basics that they'll be prepared to write at least badly. There's nothing that I can see which is wrong with it, I just found it to be a waste of paper, money, and time. <br /> <br />(The one good thing I have to say about it is that in one of the last chapters Field describes the process of showing one's work to others -- that everyone is (or thinks that they are) a writer, and unless they're very good will try to rewrite your story to be the one that they want to tell, not yours.) <br /> <br />I heartily recommend Crafty Screenwriting (by Alex Epstein) over this book. It's fresher, much better written, vastly more engaging, contains a lot more useful information, and is actually helpful to write stories that will work as movies and still be good stories.	2005-10-09
