It would not surprise me if that person was arrogant, egotistical, sexist, or worse.  He himself suffered from this egotism to the point of contemplating suicide. <br /> <br />I think it's be safe to assume that the person that emerged from that single transformative experience, lived his teaching for twenty years and began to write it down only recently, bears little relation to the person you knew. <br /> <br />Though I've never met Mr. Tolle, I can imagine that the personality of a fully-realized, or \\"enlightened\\" human being might still manage to offend certain people.  The enlightened state is one of both detachment and great compassion; ironically, the detachment of egolessness can easily be misinterpreted as egotism.  I believe Ramana Maharshi appeared that way to some.  See the Tao te Ching (Stephen Mitchell translation) for a more detailed description of such a person. <br /> <br />And once again, even if Mr. Tolle could not embody his teaching 100% of the time, it detracts nothing from his works.  The proof of the value of his teaching lies in the lives transformed by it, such as mine, from one of brooding, self-involvment, and pain, to lightness, joy and ease.   <br /> <br />Pick up a copy and give it a try.  Just keep reading it, and try to live with the teaching.   <br /> <br />Review: I have not read this new book yet, but thus far the original is my favorite book.  I can go back time and again.  In Stillness Speaks, Tolle experimented with a more concise, poetic style that I believe did not suit him as well as his extended discourses.  From the sounds of things, his new book goes back to that original style.	2005-10-12

A simply superb book, written in - I think - a much more attractive style than the majority of horse training books. At no point does Hempfling speak down to the reader - although he states his views, and the reasoning behind them, without any hesitation, and this might offend some readers who lack in open-mindedness and insight. <br /> <br />This book is definitely \\"different\\" to the usual run of training books and as such will not appeal to some. As an educated horsewoman of over 50 years experience, though, this is one of the best of the non-traditional books that I have read, and I feel I have learned a great deal from it and had many ideas and inklings confirmed by it.	2005-10-12

This coincidence did, however, lead me to her remarkable book. <br /> <br />Memoirs of screwed-up childhoods are popular these days, but few of them can match PIECES OF PIE for hellishness, heart-ache, and ultimately, redemption. We see a life destroyed, and we see a life painstakingly rebuilt. <br /> <br />But the book succeeds so well not because its elements are dramatic -- though that helps -- but because of Pie Dumas' story-telling prowess. PIECES OF PIE is alive with sensory detail, sharp observation, and a respect for the complexity of human relationships. Those things, and good old-fashioned narrative muscle.	2005-10-12

From start to finish, Michael Chorost's experience and knowledge captivated me. As the mother of a toddler with a cochlear implant, I was eager to dive into the experience of someone who once had hearing but now depended on the implant. For the first time, I was able to understand some of what my son is experiencing. His knowledge of the engineering and technology took me far beyond the basics we covered while exploring options for our son. His sensitivity to Deaf culture I found respectful and appropriate. And his ability to delve into the more personal side of his life and how he continues to grow and change I found so refreshing and honest. I hope he continues to chronicle and share as time passes. I'd definitely buy another installment!	2005-10-12

This novel is well written, packed with action, humor, and the misery-loves-company angst that made Buffy such an incredible show. <br /> <br />The story, sort of a Buffyverse version of Hitler and his genocidal mania, finds our beloved characters fighting not only evil, but their own previous mindsets as they all learn that not all demons are evil, and some are worth laying your life down for. <br /> <br />It's a story worthy of Buffy, Angel and their crews, and the author does a brilliant job of bringing the two casts together.  He has a gift for painting a picture with his words that bring the characters to life in the reader's mind.  He describes Angel, crouching like a stone gargoyle, and captures that bat-like thing that makes Angel so delicious. <br /> <br />I loved the book and was sorry when it came to an end.  It's definitely worth the read. <br /> <br />I only have one complaint with this book.  The Spike bashing other reviewers have mentioned - it's the only reason I didn't give this book five stars.  Major Spike Bash-o-rama! <br /> <br /> <br />The cruel things they say to Spike, especially Buffy, go way beyond being funny or amusing.  They even go past being irksome.  The bashing is not only distracting, it actually takes something away from an otherwise great and beautifully written story.  Spike even saves Angel's life, and they all still treat him like crap.  Even Willow takes pot shots at him.  It's ... disconcerting. <br /> <br />If you're a devoted Spike fan, it'll likely tick you off.  And that's a shame, because everything else in this book comes together so well. <br /> <br />Was the Spike Slamming Contest really necessary? <br /> <br />Nope.  Nor was it comic relief. <br /> <br />Aside from that, a thoroughly enjoyable book from cover to cover.	2005-10-12

Although this is not a particularly quick read (and a bit dry),  <br /> <br />it is very informative.  It is less about Morgan Spulocks debut film \\"Super-Size Me\\" and more about fast food, junk food over eating and nutrition.  One  <br /> <br />thing I particularly like about this book is that he goes in to detail about the caloric content of many fast foods going as far as comparing the caloric  <br /> <br />intake of a meal at one fast food establishment to another which yield some surprising results.  What you think is a healthy dining choice may not be at  <br /> <br />all.  Morgan stresses the importance of eating whole foods and home cooked meals.  \\"Don't Eat This Book's\\" message is simple; If you eat good healthy food  <br /> <br />and exercise you will be a healthy person, if you do the opposite you will not live a healthy and happy life.  I reccomend this to anyone interested in  <br /> <br />nutrition, health or obesity!	2005-10-12

I found this book fun to read and very enlightening. Mr. Sherman has a witty writing style and gives very compelling reasons for home schooling.  I found myself longing to have made that choice but as my son is now in high school, it's a moot point.  I just learned from my step-daughter that she has decided to home school her 4th and 5th graders because the school they attend in North Las Vegas is very rough.  I visited Amazon.com to order a copy of the book for her but when I discovered that it's on backorder, I decided to send her my copy. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this book for parents who home school, for relatives of home school parents and for those who are considering this option.	2005-10-12

During the period of the 1745 rebellion, the 'big kilt' (f&egrave;ileadh-m&ograve;r) was essentially a large blanket rolled about the body and belted in the middle. There was no flat apron in the front and the kilt didn't necessarily open on right side. The standardization of the modern kilt is due to regulations of Highland regiments in the 19th/20th centuries.<br /><br />I suggest anyone interested in the topic read:<br /><br />Hugh Cheape's 'Tartan',<br /><br /> J.Telfer Dunbar's 'History of Highland Dress,<br /><br />Christian Hesketh's 'Tartans', or<br /><br />McClintock' & Dunbar's 'Old Irish and Highland Dress'.<br /><br />The editor seems to be unaware that 'Highlander' is synonymous with<br /><br />'Scottish Gael'; that is, the first language of Highlanders is Gaelic, not Scots English.<br /><br />The book would have been enriched with quotes from J.L. Campbell's 'Highland Songs of the Forty-Five', contemporary Jacobite songs in the original Gaelic with English translations, or Ronald Black's 'An Lasair', also bilingual.	2005-10-12

Stormbreaker was a great way to introduce me to this series and i thought it was good so i gave the next book a shot and i wasn't disappointed or at least not very much.. I really liked the way the characters  were described and how their personalities came out really good. The first few chapters of the books were pretty boring just like in any other book, but then things started to pick up. The main character Alex Rider is a 14 year old boy who finds himself  inside the  British Intelligence Agency (MI6) as one of their top  agents. Anthony Horowitz  tells how Alex goes undercover to the  school of Point Blank (somewhere in the  French Alps). He finds  an evil scientist who is trying to take over the world,  and he  is the only one who can foil his plan. Any way the book was pretty good over all, BUT it wasn't all that great for example the ending sucked i'm sorry it just did, this is why the book was really exciting most of the way through and at the end it only got better, but then at the end when it was getting really exciting he just stopped and he didn't say what happened at the end. That is the one thing i find really annoying and really hate. I would rate this book a 3/5 because of the ending. I would recommend this book the people that like action packed books with a not so great ending and to the people that like james bond movies this book is right up your alley. <br />	2005-10-12

This is a very good reference/utility book for any software designer, developer, maintainer...  Unlike the traditional design pattern books, which talk about how to apply various design patterns under various situations, this book focus more on how to find badly designed and implemented code and apply simple yet effective patterns to make the existing code better.  The author starts with listing some common problems in the existing code, such as conditonal complexity, long method, etc.  He goes on by suggesting some possible solutions to the problems, such as using a strategy pattern to reduce conditional complexity, etc.  He uses some very good examples and shows the detail steps involving in the refactoring process. <br /> <br />This book deserves \\"*****\\" if the complete source code before and after refactoring is available.  Without the complete source code, it takes much more time and effort in trying to understand what is involved in the refactoring process.	2005-10-12

Not having had the pleasure of reading the previous titles before Ms. Ewell Foster's latest effort I admit to some fear that I would be lost in the dust.  This was a senseless fear as Ms. Ewell Foster took the time to catch readers up without dropping the storyline or boring long time fans.<br /><br />The story opens with a bang as we stand along side Naomi on the set of \\"The Wheel of Fortune.\\"  The improbable happens and this lady manages to win.  Same day she finds out that she has lost her job and with no direct plans in the future except to attend the wedding of her best friend Mary, Naomi begins her journey into self evaluation.  Her journey will take her to Bodega Bay, where she will find another friend in the unlikely Ruthie, a former drug addict, abused, and abandoned rich girl. Naomi feels lost but she won't for much longer.<br /><br />Anthony who is good friends with Moor (Mary's fianc&eacute;) finds himself with a pink slip, and a request from his long-term girlfriend to hit the streets.  They are through!  Anthony packs up his few belongings and with time on his hands decides to follow up on a teenage dream.  This quest will take him to Napa Valley, a place of beauty and peace. But will he find the one thing that he's looking for?<br /><br />Along the way we are re-introduced to friends and family that some how or another connect with Mary, Moor, or Naomi.  This is truly a story that celebrates life, friendship, and love.  I truly enjoyed this read as Ms. Ewell Foster manages to cross gender, social, and ethnic barriers to deliver a heart warming read.  Thelma Latrice, Mary, are friends that everyone should be blessed with.  Add to these colorful ladies, Garvin Meemaw and the rest of this colorful cast of characters and you have a well populated but entertaining read.  This is truly an inspirational read in more ways than one.<br /><br />Official Reviewer for Romance Designs	2005-10-12

The Secret Life of Bees was a wonderful, beautifully nuanced work of modern fiction, blending Southern gothic with mysticism and a modern look at the dynamics of family. This novel was, despite my best efforts to see otherwise, a somewhat beautiful mess. I applaud her effort, but to me, the characters never rose above the level of facile caricature, and at times I almost laughed aloud at the silliness of both the style and dialogue. Here's hoping the next is better. This author is truly gifted, but this novel is a well-intentioned flop.	2005-10-12

On a whim, I finally decided to get one from the library this past weekend. I vaguely remembered reading Frog & Toad as a child, but couldn't remember any of the specific stories. <br /> <br />We are having SO much fun listening to these stories! The stories are so delightful, and my son is really enjoying it too. I think we were both pleasantly surprised to hear it and to experience listening to an audiotape for a change instead of our usual \\"mommy read a book\\" routine. Of course, the occasional music (which is oh so perfect in how it depicts what's going on in the story....particularly for moments depicting light moments, and also those depicting danger) and the author's tone of the voice are what add to already great adventures in the book. <br /> <br />The first day we listened to it, we had so much fun that we played it about 3 more times in a row. My son asks for us to listen/read the story every night.  <br /> <br />I agree with one other reviewer who said the author's narration (voice, tone, etc) is perfect for the story.  <br /> <br />My son loves all the stories, although for The Dream story, he looks a little perplexed, so I told him it's a story about a dream and most dreams don't make sense. <br /> <br />In \\"A List\\", he loves the part where Toad says \\"Blah\\". And he also loves when earlier in that story, you can hear the sound of a door opening as Toad leaves his house on his way to see Frog. My son just turns to me and grins from ear to ear. <br /> <br />For the \\"Cookies\\" story, he loves to hear the crunch of the cookie as Toad take that first bite at his own house before he goes to Frog's. He also enjoys hearing Toad tell Frog all the different ways that they can get into the box.  <br /> <br />His very favorite line in the book though is in \\"Dragons and Giants\\", when the snake comes out the cave and says, \\"Hello Lunch\\". We both crack up over time....and sometimes rewind it a few times :-) <br /> <br />Like all the other reviewers mentioned, this is definitely a wonderful book about friendship. It was also interesting to read many reviewers note how there are so many real-life learning examples in it for adults. So true. <br /> <br />Of all the books we've read, this is by far the one that has engaged my son the most, which is saying a lot since he has about 15 Thomas books and is usually preoccupied with those. <br /> <br />This is I definitely have to get the other books from the collection. Definitely a classic. <br /> <br />Happy reading everyone :-) <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

The very minute I opened the book it was almost impossible to lay it down. The story starts with her journey from her home in Eastern Kentucky to Dehra Dun in India to the arms of an Indian male child waiting for her. This story is told with so much detail that you make every move, see everything, hear everything, as she wanders through the streets, alleys, homes and government agencies of India, preparing for the adoption of her son. You laugh with her, cry with her, and grieve with her, as she encounters one stumbling block after another in her journey that was to last a few weeks and turned into three and one half months away from her loving family in Kentucky. She logs for us the beauty, the depression, and introduces the reader to many characters who play such an integral part in her journey. Her faith in God leads her through countless days of anticipation, and her belief in the almighty power of prayer, enables her to continue her journey until she brings the reader from India back to her home in Eastern Kentucky, and introduces the child to a waiting and loving family.  <br /> <br />After you read the last few lines of the book, you will want to open it again and start all over, just in case you missed something. You will remember this powerful story and the characters she introduces you to long after you close \\"Journey to the Son.\\"	2005-10-12

Overall I would have to say that this is definitely one of the better LSAT logic games books. Why, because unlike many, it tries to show you techniques that are at least fairly consistent without being too \\"gimmicky.\\" In addition, they do a fairly comprehensive guide of building up a basic foundation of basic game types and moving on to permutations of those basic games, but they at least also tell you what the likelihood is of actually coming across those particular types of questions. One additional fringe benefit that I found particularly helpful was their updated content which is available for free online at their webpage. I highly recommend going there to get the latest info, at the very least they have a chapter addendum that you can look at to get an idea of the rest of the book's content and style. <br /> <br />If I had to do it all over again, I would have studied from this book first, than practiced those particular game types before moving on. Time management is my biggest weakness and I've yet to find an overall strategy that works to help me deal with this. In any case, this book is a very, very good value for the money.	2005-10-12

I'd argue that most Stephen King stories aren't so much about the horror or fantastic elements in the story so much as they're about how those horrific or fantastic elements affect ordinary people. King's great strength is taking ordinary characters, developing them a bit and then setting them down in some circumstance and watching how they deal with it. For some like Jack Torrence, they go mad. For others, like Roland the Gunslinger, they become a sort of anti-hero. But in all of these stories, the insanity of the worlds King creates are grounded by characters who feel authentic.<br /><br />For King, it's less about the destination and more about the journey. Let's see how these characters react to things, he seems to say.<br /><br />Such is the case with his latest novel The Colorado Kid.<br /><br />Really, to call it a novel is stretching the defintion, especially by the tome sized standard King has set with previous novels. Weighing it at just under 200 pages, this one might be better classified as a novella. Luckily, it's part of the Hard Case Crime series and is published to increase the visiblity of the line (it helped me with as I've read half a dozen of the other books published under this banner). Also, it's offered at a lower price to the consumer. So, if it only takes you a couple of hours to read, you're only out six bucks and not the price of a hard-cover.<br /><br />Now, I will warn you--those of you looking for a neat, tidy little mystery might want to look elsewhere. King acknowledges this in his afterward saying this novel will be one that fans love or hate with little middle ground. And I can see why. The story is one of a dead body discovered on a beach in Maine and how the investigation into solving that mystery affects his family, the people around him and two newspaper reporters who have kept the story to themselves all these years. The story is told by the two guys to a young female reporter so they can share the secret and keep it going. Again, let me say that this is not a neat, tidy package where thing will all be resolved in the end. King offers up some solutions and bits of answers, but there is no great denouncement or a smoking gun. In short--this ain't an Agatha Christie mystery where the culprit is denounced by the final chapter after a lot of red herrings over the course of the novel.<br /><br />Instead, what you get is a story of how the mystery affects everyone is comes in contact with. Some are forever changed, some aren't. And King's greatest strength--creating intersting characters, whether it be for two pages or 180 plus--is fully on display here. There is little or no supernatural stuff happening here, but instead an interesting little story that is a pleasant way to spend a few hours with a good book.ing.

There were periods when European Christianity was just as bad as Wahabbi Salafism.  The people to emulate are the founding fathers of the USA, almost all were secular deists.  They saw the evil of organized religion, no matter what form.  What would they do if they were transported in time to the present and ran the \\"War on Terror\\"? <br /> <br />1.  Have the Senate reafirm article 11 the Treaty of Tripoli, which it unanimously passed in 1797.  It reads: <br />\\"As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquillity, of Mussulmen; and, as the said States never entered into any war, or act of hostility against any Mahometan nation, it is declared by the parties, that no pretext arising from religious opinions, shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries\\". <br /> <br />2. Propose new treaties of religious toleration and push Muslim countries and Israel to sign them.  It is important that all anti apostacy and anti blasphemy laws be repealed.  No religion should be mentioned on identity cards.  Civil marriages should be allowed everywhere. <br /> <br />3. Mount a massive propaganda campaign to push the secularization of society.  It is absolutely essential that Muslims realize they have no proof of the truth of their religion, just as Christians, Jews and Hindus can't prove theirs.  If that means attacking popular interpretations of statements in the Koran, so be it. <br /> <br />4. Force Israel to go tit for tat with its Muslim enemies.  For example, if the Jewish community of Medina is reestablished, then an equivalent number of Arab Muslims will be allowed to return to Israel. <br /> <br />	2005-10-12

Descriptions of the location and the people lead the reader to believe that \\"North Fork\\" is utterly depressing and that those who live there are uneducated, bigoted, obese idiots.  This book shows the author's lack of understanding and utter disrespect for the people of the area.  This book was overblown and unrealistic.  I was so distracted by the author's obvious contempt for \\"North Fork\\" and it's residents that I was distracted from what could have been an interesting storyline, had it been fully developed and written with an understanding of the socio-economic systems that exist outside of most large cities.

Taken place during our time period, we follow Harvard graduate and world renowned symbologist, Robert Langdon on his journey to find out why and how a mysterious symbol from an ancient brotherhood has resurfaced. Although he begins his journey at a very secretive Swiss research facility, his journey takes him deep inside Vatican City. this page turner keeps you in suspense after every chapter, it is almost impossible to put this book down. It is recommended for adult readers for language and controversial issues. <br /> <br />Angels and Demons is one for those who love suspense. It is also a good read for those who love to read historical fiction. Dan Brown does an excellent job of keeping the reader interested and wanting to know more about what happense to Robert Langdon and his comrades. Within the first few paragraphs of the novel, you can tell that this book will keep you wanting more. How often in a novel does it begin with an unpredictible murder that know one can figure out how or why it happened? From the very beginning and throughout the whole novel, you will be enticed. After Robert Langdon arrives at the scene of the crime, he figures out that the secret symbol is that of an ancient brotherhood called the illuminati. The brotherhood has a reputation of hating the catholic church and the church has doene everything in its power to abolish the brotherhood. Until now, the illuminati has been thought extinct. Not only has the illuminati resurfaced to power but they have stolen one of the most powerful and deadly compounds in the world...antimatter. Antimatter is the opposite of matter so when they come in contact with each other, it can be very deadly. It gets better than this, the illuminati has hidden the antimatter deep inside Vatican City. After the recent death of the pope, the ceremony to pick the new one is about to take place called conclave. This of course means that all of the cardinals needto be present, especially the most important four called the preferiti. These are the four who are in the running to be the next pope. Not only have the illuminati hidden the antimatter but the preferiti are somehow missing from the ceremony. <br />	2005-10-12

Morgan's provocative third novel even begins, he dedicates it to \\"all those, globally, whose lives have been wrecked or snuffed out by the Great Neoliberal Dream and Slash-and-Brun Globalization\\". He also makes sure the reader knows he drew inspiration from left-wing extremists like Noam Chomsky, John Pilger and Michael Moore. The reader, upon encountering this, could be forgiven for slipping the book quietly back on the shelf with a slight shake of the head. But that would be a mistake. <br /> <br />Despite the ideological chest-thumping, \\"Market Forces\\" is not just a wisp of a story wrapped around a shrill anti-capitalist polemic. It's actually a rollicking good read that doesn't get swamped by the author's ideological crusade, except perhaps near the end. But more on that later. <br /> <br />The setting is deliciously twisted. Fifty years from now, the world is run by a handful of financial houses that deal in \\"conflict investment\\" -- giving financial assistance to tinpot dictators in exchange for a cut of the country's GDP if they stay in power. Executives vie for promotion or contract tenders by staging highway duels in armored cars. It's a bizzare mixture -- \\"Liar's Poker\\" meets \\"Mad Max\\" -- but Morgan deftly pulls it off. <br /> <br />Morgan's first novel proved that he is adept at drawing imperfect characters, and here he serves up a whole cast of scummy anti-heros and scummier villians. Chris Faulkner fought his way up from the slums and is a new hotshot executive. His wife, Carla, is a mechanic who keeps his sedan in prime dueling condition. Her father is an idealistic outcast whose socialist views are a constant source of tension in the family. Along the way, Chris falls in with a media vixen, a chummy but brutal partner, and a team of envious colleagues intent on seeing the newcomer go down in flames, quite literally if it should come to that. <br /> <br />The action ticks over nicely as Chris careens between stoking conflicts in Cambodia and Latin America, terrorizing street thugs with Mike, and grinding rival investors into scrap metal under the bumper of his armored Saab. All the while he is trying to rescue his foundering marriage and avoid the plasticene temptations of Liz, a powerful journalist tracking his career. <br /> <br />While Morgan's conclusions on the nature of the modern geo-political/economic system may be black and white, he lays it out for us through shades of gray. The rapacious corporations are clearly the bad guys, but characters like Mike are strangely charismatic, and it's easy to cheer the suits when they wield their power to wipe out white supremacists or permanently cripple an abusive husband for beating his wife. Likewise, those characters with the \\"right\\" socialist viewpoints are quick to espouse their ideals but are too weak or scared to act on them. <br /> <br />Morgan's contention that capitalism is inherently brutal and self-destructive only starts to become obvious in the last part of the book as Chris repeatedly snubs chances for redemption and mires himself deeper in the brutal corporate culture he once held at arm's length. But the book works despite this late-game heavy-handedness, and while I might have wished for a cheerier conclusion, I have to give credit to Morgan for pushing things to what he must see as their logical conclusion, insofar as that logic works in the fantasy version of capitalism and globalization he has constructed. <br /> <br />This *is* a sci-fi book, after all.	2005-10-12

I am a huge racing enthusist and jump at the chance to start getting into depth about the sport. The only thing that surprised me was the fact that the saddle club knew so little about racehorses. But coming from me, who's been learning everything I possibly can about horse racing since last summer doesn't come as a surprise. Sometimes when I was reading the book, I wished I was the fourth member of the saddle club and could tell them so much more than what the author made them learn. That was just the very very very basic things. There is so much else to learn to get into this fascinating and age-old sport.<br /><br />Prancer's accident is one of not so many that happen at the racetrack. racing usually doesn't have so many horses drop out because with injuries *although this year, with the retirement of Roses In May and Kitten's Joy, that fact is questionable.* The key is to not ask the horse to do more than he can perform. Wright's dying wish was what forever crippled Citation. But trainers who have their heads on straight will do what's right for the horse. Plus, it is highly unlikely that Prancer's father would be used for breeding anyway. The hereditary hoof infection would just continue to pass, so they probably could have had better luck gelding and selling him as an english mount. But all the same, the book made the saddle club learn some good lessons and thankfully, coming off of the worst book of the series (#12) learning something worthwhile. Pretty enjoyable except for the fact that I already knew what they were learning. But very good overall anyway.	2005-10-12

This is not a criticism in any way, just a forewarning that I read this book cover to cover in well under two hours. To Carnahan's credit, he doesn't waste a lot of words and manages to stuff a fair amount of vivid imagery and wacky action in a small package. When a book comes blurbed by Elmore Leonard, Carl Hiassan, and John Ridley, you pretty much know you're going to get an outsize crime caper populated with bizarro characters, snappy dialogue, and some kind of anti-hero -- and that's just what Carnahan delivers<br /><br />Protagonist Bailey is a 22-year-old slacker on break from college and in the midst of a run of larceny. From the moment we meet him, lying in the desert, holding his genitals, whacked out on peyote, and bleeding from his neck, we are propelled into an ultra-lurid cartoon underworld. The story flashes back and forth between Bailey's actions after getting off the desert floor, and giving the backstory as to how he got there. Basically, the story revolves around a payroll heist Bailey planned at the skanky circus he was working at. This was going to be the long con that would pay his college tuition and allow him to return to the normal world. It's a pretty standard neo-noir genre tale, with Bailey on the run from some nasty circus freaks (owners of the circus, they want their money back plus a pound of flesh), while also trying to track down his double-crossing partners in crime.<br /><br />This quest leads him to LA, where he meets an awfully nice hippie-chick/recovering addict named Sissy. She ends up tagging along with him to a Tarantinoesque climax at a SoCal biker meth lab where the freaks also manage to catch up with him. There's a rather predictable bloodbath of an ending, and it all ends rather neatly. The one major complaint I have with the story is that Sissy's presence at the end proves vital, but makes no sense based on her character. Carnahan establishes her as being tough, common-sense, and heavy into recovery, and yet after a single night with Bailey, she's going to tag along to a meet with some heavy biker meth dealers out in the middle of nowhere? A meeting that even Bailey admits has a good chance of ending with him dead? Even cartoons need to have internal consistency, and this is the one part of the ride that doesn't work.<br /><br />In any event, it's a mostly fun little diversion, if somewhat disposable and forgettable. The outsize characters are almost all given enough personality to stand on their own. I especially liked the weirdo who picks up hitchhiking Bailey at the start, and the titular Serpent Girl (a woman with no arms and legs) is a creepy but affecting character, and Carnahan manages to fulfill the clown stereotype with extreme nastiness. In the end, although the characters are pretty nifty, and there's some really nice descriptive moments and dialogue, the book still manages to feel derivative and lacking in something. It's perfectly fine pulp fiction, but not something I would recommend to anyone I know unless they like to read anything and everything relating to circuses.ce at the end proves vital, but makes no sense based on her character.

Michael Connelly has put aside, for the moment, his Harry Bosch novels and stepped into the world of the \\"legal thriller.\\" I'm sorry he waited this long to do it.<br /><br />Mickey Haller is a \\"Lincoln lawyer.\\" That does not mean that Lincoln was his idol or that he was elected to some prestigious group. What it means is that Mickey uses a Lincoln Towne car as his office and his mode of transportation amongst the various court houses in the LA area. After 15 years of practice, whatever high ideals about the law he may have had have pretty much gone by the wayside. In his opinion \\"the law is a large rusting machine that sucks up people and lives and money. I am just a mechanic and I have become expert at going inside the machine and fixing things and extracting what I need from it in return.\\"<br /><br />In this artfully crafted story, Haller is retained to represent a young man who is alleged to have assaulted and attempted to rape his victim. However, as he investigates the case, doors from the past open and he is eventually confronted with one of the most delicious legal delemnas an attorney can confront. To try and outline the story here would only spoil it for you later. The writing is powerful and the court room  action is authentic.<br /><br />This is a tale which will hold your attention from beginning to end and leave you looking for Mr. Connelly's next excursion into this type of fiction.	2005-10-12

If anyone enjoys or is interested in reading a gripping spy thriller or just an amazing thriller I suggest you pick up Good News, Bad News by David Wolstencroft.  <br /> <br />The author is the award-winning writer and creator of the MI-5 tv show on A&E (or Spooks in England) and, as a reviewer put it, a modern day John le Carre. Besides being able to weave an amazing plot with plenty of twists like Ludlum, Wolstencroft's best achievement is his being able to break the mold from previous previous previous Cold War spy novel writers and their archetype of characters and scenarios. For example, the characters possess a sense of realistic wit and use modern technology such as text messaging.  <br /> <br />Good news? It was an amazing read. Bad news? It had to end. Good news? Wolstencroft has another novel out, Contact Zero!	2005-10-12

It goes without saying that they are thrilled, but that does not last long. Charlie is kidnapped, and his parents, Claudio, King Boris, Sergie, Ninu and two lions promptly take off after him.<br /><br />The Truth was really good, though not as good as the first book. There was not as much humor, tension or the exhalent conversations between Charlie and the lions. Sergie was in this book, but he was not as prominent as in the other two books, I really missed that. There was not as much conversation between Charlie's parents. Primo was in this book, but only briefly. I really missed all those parts, and also the fact that the characters did not seem as bright as in the previous books. But the thing I liked least was the beginning, on the beginning Charlie's parents make some very dumb choices, without those choices the plot would almost be impossible, but they come off as cheesy because of the brilliance these people have already shown. I did like Ninu, but a chameleon, especially when it does not have as much character as the lions, is really no substitute for the lions.<br /><br />If you liked the other two books I would probably recommend this book  because of some of the resolutions in the climax. If you Have not read `Lionboy' and `Lionboy the Chase' you will get nothing out of this book. If you haven't read those books I would HIGHLY recommend them before you read this book.	2005-10-12

Stirling revisits the world of his Island in the Sea of Time trilogy in which the island of Nantucket and its population is mysteriously transported three thousand years into the past. This novel tells us what happened back in the world Nantucket was lifted out of. Following that night with its strange, lightning-like lights, people discover that none of their technology works. Cars coast to a halt and airplanes fall from the sky. From then on electricity no longer flows; internal combustion engines don't work; and guns won't fire bullets. This event comes to be known as \\"The Change\\". <br /> <br />The story follows the adjustment to \\"The Change\\" of two people -- Mike Havel and Juniper Mackenzie -- who become instrumental in establishing a new society. Mike is a pilot flying a family of five to their wilderness cabin when \\"The Change\\" occurs. Juniper is a Wiccan - a \\"New Age\\" witch -- who plays music at a local bar in Oregon when \\"The Change\\" happens. As society degenerates to savagery each becomes the leader of a community of followers. Those incorporated into these new communities bring knowledge and skills from a diverse set of backgrounds, including military service, urban gang membership and role-playing in Renaissance Fairs and such like.   <br /> <br />Mike and Juniper's groups eventually meet and agree to be allies against a common enemy - the \\"Lord Protector\\".  The Lord Protector is a former professor of medieval history who, finding himself quite at home in a world virtually returned to the Dark Ages, has set himself up as a king. Not only must they ultimately have a battle with his forces, but they also have to contend with bandits, White supremacists, and \\"eaters\\"-- people who have resorted to cannibalism. <br /> <br />Stirling is an intense and exciting writer who is particularly good at describing military operations and battle scenes. He creates characters that are memorable and believable. His premise is utterly absurd and presented without the slightest effort at a plausible explanation, but if you will practice a little suspension of disbelief you will soon find yourself too caught up in the tale to think about its absurdity. Once you have, this is a book you won't find easy to put down	2005-10-12
US	53017184	R1UKU3PBS0P3N3	1904027288	909457366	Tatiana: Five Passports in a Shifting Europe	Books	4	16	16	N	N	The Death of Mittel Europa	This is a moving first hand account of Mittel Europa's suicide in the mid 20th century and the impact of the proceedings on a woman born to privilege and married into yet more privilege.  What the book lacks by way of analytical insight and literary quality is rather more than made up for by the honesty and the immediacy of the account.  The humanity of the account shines through the occasional purple prose and the numerous spelling errors - on all of which headings the author should have been well served by an astute editor.    In the first instance, the book is a warning about the dangers of \\"grand ideas\\" in human affairs.  Here the dangers witnessed at first hand by a woman of grace and nobility first in her native Russia, at the hands of the Bolsheviks, and then in her adopted Mittel Europa at the hands of the National Socialists.  When institutions and customs of long standing are peremptorily destroyed and replaced by new fangled constructs, individual liberty inevitably destructs and the consequence is suffered by serf and prince alike.  Not a new thought this.  Any reader of Edmund Burke's speech on the French revolution is undoubtedly familiar with the main line of argument.  And yet it is one thing to read the fine logic and the even finer rhetoric of Burke's oratory and quite another to see the human dimension of the argument.  On this view, the non-analytical version presented in Tatiana is more moving, horrifying and edifying than Burke's oratorical flourishes in the English Parliament.    In the final analysis Tatiana's is a story of hope.  For it is a testament to the enduring existence of the European civilization and experience undamaged by the \\"grand ideas\\" of the pernicious 20th century.  The aristocracy of the 19th century (and the inter-war years) may have been it previous embodiment and the EU its present manifestation but the civilization endures.  Tatiana's life is a testament to not only the will of Europe to survive but also to do so with grace and panache.  The barbarians may appear at the gate, they may breach the walls, they may even momentarily penetrate and occupy the citadel but they always fail to prevail.  And Tatiana's story is a most delicious and gratifying paean to the triumph of Europe over its most recent barbarian invaders!  The ones that came not across the steppes but arrived in the dead of the night by train into Finland Station and begot even more dangerous offspring in the Germanic lands.	2005-10-12

That was a whirlwind of chaos and loose ends never tied up. <br /> <br />I loved the first two books in this trilogy and couldn't wait to get my hands on the last book, the conclusion of what, until now, had been a great story. <br /> <br />Things kinda fell apart in this book.  Okay ... not kinda.  They totally fell apart. <br /> <br />The authors tried to pack so much into this one novel that it's almost impossible to keep up with without a map!  It was rushed, and as a reader I felt it.  It left me feeling winded and exhausted. <br /> <br />As others have mentioned, the continuity in this novel leaves much to be desired.  There were storylines left unfinished, big ones.   <br /> <br />Willow stops breathing and dies in one chapter, steps out of the room looking pale and ill and says to Cordy, \\"I feel dead,\\" in another chapter, and then is her usual self in the rest of the book.  It ends with no conclusion or even acknowledgment that it even occured at all.  I kept waiting for Willow to go evil and betray them, or take some kind of unexpected action as a result of apparently dying, but nada. <br /> <br />Faith is thrown in the mix in a slick, almost after-thought manner that doesn't do her character justice.  (And that says a LOT coming from me, because I'm not a Faith or Eliza fan.)  She comes in and saves everyone, despite their obvious distrust, and then hugs Buffy and Angel before willingly going back to jail. She didn't even get a Thank You.  It just didn't fly, it was never rang true or came to life for me. <br /> <br />And then there's Spike.  I love this guy.  Love the wit, the naughty undertone to his character and the huge heart he tries to hide.  (Figuratively speaking, of course.)  He's a great character, and provides great comic relief.  But what in the world happened to him?  What was the ending supposed to mean?  The story ended with him, in his pre-vamp body, running like a coward and hurling himself into a light, begging for help.   <br /> <br />Huh? <br /> <br />When this book ends, it leaves the reader feeling like the story is unfinished.  They crammed too much into it and it got sloppy.  They could've easily fleshed it out and added another novel to the series. <br /> <br />A disappointing ending to what had otherwise been a terrific story.	2005-10-12

It doesn't have much information on centuries prior to the twentieth and largely focuses on art, artists, and issues from the 1960's on, so it wouldn't do as the only text for such a course. But this is all you need for late twentieth century concerns.<br /><br />The early essays are dripping with Freudian psychology and psychoanalytical social criticism. The issues surrounding why it took so long for there to be a sense of equality of greatness amongst artists of all genders is explored deeply. The issues of representation of all races and sexual orientations then follows. The book stops just short of discussing the newest research on intersex persons (persons born with an extra chomosome, among others {XXY, for example}).<br /><br />For a movement that was intending to create a sense of equality, feminist theory highlights both the vast differences as well as the profound similarities between the perception processes of men and women. This includes both the perceptions of and different approaches to art as well as life. Yet, when all is said and done, more recent artists are primarily interested not in these issues, but more a sense of having their work judged based on its quality, not their gender.<br /><br />The only disappointment I have in this book is one that no other book addresses either. So, I mean this only as a minor criticism. In short, the book does not answer the following: Is ther an intersex mind state? Feminist theory either didn't reach the point of asking this in time for the extensive research put into this book or it has come to its conclusion and will transform gradually into a whole other movement.<br /><br />The art chosen to represent the above ideas and explorations is top quality. The reproductions are sharp and colorful. I would recommend this book to anyone with interests in women in art or in feminist theory.	2005-10-11

Lucky for me, this was the book I picked off the shelf when I wanted to start knitting.

It starts with the very basics of knitting and gives you simple projects to practice what you just learned.

The author does not mistake socialism for totalitarianism. Historical socialism is the religious belief that if you steal property from every individual and hand it to the state (who defines the state?), people will magically become better human beings -- all will be egalitarian, err equal.<br /><br />Socialism is state religion forced on the individual by its believers. Simple. Stealing any form of property from those who earn to hand it out to those who did not is pure theft. Look what has happened in China when the communist priests (The Party) finally allowed capitalism (ownership and merit) into China. Marx is wrong.<br /><br />Socialism should be treated like all religions, no one has the right to impose their religious beliefs on another adult.<br /><br />\\"Heaven on Earth\\" proves it.	2005-10-11

The book offers academics a new set of data and interpretations concerning the role that ethnicity plays on patterns of interpersonal violence. The author contrasts \\"structural\\" explanations with \\"cultural\\" explanations in an attempt to evaluate the relative importance of such social forces. Although many criminologists favor structural views and are wary to consider the role of culture (especially concerning ethnicity), Mullen provides strong support for the cultural thesis. For readers less familiar with this academic debate, first recognize that most homicides involve interpersonal disputes over money, romantic relationships, or other squabbles. Structural theorists think that non-cultural forces such as discrimination, unemployment and poverty lead to more frustration among individuals, and this in turn leads to violent forms of dispute resolution. Cultural theorists agree with this, but highlight that different populations have different cultural rules and values about how disputes should be resolved. In some societies, individuals can actually be punished by their peers for not acting aggressively to react to insults or to resolve disputes. Mullen does an excellent job illustrating that a variety of groups such as the Chinese, Italians, Irish, and Mexicans all were somewhat different in their preferences to deal with disputes. For example, the Chinese immigrants brought with them Tong organizations that eventually became involved in the vice industry. These organizations also had a strong sense of group loyalty and honor that resulted in many \\"tit for tat\\" killings to save face after one's organization had been slighted. Overall, Mullen is correct not to dichotomize the debate between culture and society, but to understand the complex interactions between these forces. In reality, BOTH social structure and culture are important!  <br /> <br/> <br />Although of interest to academics, this book is also a great read for non-academic readers. The book is jargon free, and is easy to understand. Many of the anecdotes read like a fun crime novel! Being a university teacher, I also think this book would be great to still up conversation and debate in university classes concerning criminology, violence, and immigration. I sincerely hope the book is soon offered in a paperback so as to make the book more affordable to students! In sum, this is a great book for a variety of audiences!!! <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

Indeed, some seem unaware that he has written other books, at all.  Halperin's Ph.D. is in Classics, as in all things ancient Greek and Roman, not English or Queer Theory.  He has been a Classics professor in a Department of Classics.  I once had a Classics professor who had been his advisee as either an undergraduate or graduate student, I don't recall which.  He gravitated to Queer Theory only sometime thereafter.  He has written a book largely about the history of male-male sex in antiquity, _One Hundred Years of Homosexuality and Other Essays in Greek Love_, which is both well-known and standard reading in the field, in which he largely follows Kenneth Dover.  As far as I know, and I am surmising from what I have read, he now teaches in an English department only because: (a) he has become somewhat disenchanted with sexual-identity politics in Classics departments, (b) he is now much more interested in Queer Theory, though he continues to address antiquity in the occasionally plublished essay, some of which have also become standard in the field, (c) many Queer Theorists have gravitated to English departments, and, (d) as a Classics Ph.D., he is well qualified to teach ancient literature.   <br /> <br />Though I choose not to adopt Halperin's suggestions in this book in their entirety, I do see a very great deal worth either adopting or rigorously considering in this book.  I particularly enjoy his treatment of the controversies and shady dealings surrounding Bernadette Brooten and Amy Richlin.	2005-10-11

For Mr. Harris that villain is religious belief.  He is astounded that some people in this would have the audacity to believe in a power higher than themselves.  Moreover, he is convinced - like a conspiracy nut looking for a grand unification theory - that there would not be misery but for the irrational propensity to religion.  Never mind that there would not be a Sistine chapel or Handel's Messiah either- humanity has been held back by monkish superstition foisted upon it by charlatans. <br /> <br />There is really nothing new here, except perhaps for the level of vitriol aimed at modern believers.  When you impose a philosophy of objective characterizations on a matter that summons personal and subjective beliefs it is called chauvinism.  When you condemn a people for their religious beliefs it is called hatred.  This quibbling mountain of twaddle somehow relishes in both.  Bowing in homage to the humanist altar of `science', Mr. Harris writes with myopic intensity that makes the reader question his motives.  Is he disheartened by American political trends which polarize policymaking on the basis of moral approbation?  Is he threatened by those who challenge the ironclad orthodoxies of his `Star Trek' like world-view?  I suspect that his work has its appeal for an insular minority of nattering intelligentsia, but almost no marketable potential as a political movement.  In the United States an object called the Constitution (drafted by pernicious Christians) presents a formidable obstacle to his `final solution' of eradicating religious inclination.  Atheistic fascism of the early 20th century failed to give this sort of ranting any political traction in American life.  Why should this book be any more successful?   <br /> <br />Somewhere a college professor is thumbing through this book madly with ecstacy.  I suppose even the nonbelievers have their Bibles.	2005-10-11

The memory of the intensity of my response remains with me today.     I would invite today's reader to imagine the social and political climate of the times before passing too harsh a judgement on the work.  The realization of women's and civil rights didn't happen as a result of a single event. It was an on-going struggle that took place during an equally frustrating, long term social initiative to end the war in Vietnam. Everyone new somebody who had been lost. To whatever degree people were for or against the war, everyone shared a deep sense of frustration about the resulting national divide.  In those angry times, Women's Room was a literary lightening rod to ground.	2005-10-11

This edition adds some chapters to Geza Vermes' (1983) Jesus and the World of Judaism.  Most of the essays date back to the 70s and 80s.  The Qumran related ones are more recent (1996, 1999) and the reflection in the final chapter is taken from Vermes' autobiography, published in 1998.<br /><br />Vermes is now mainstream, though it appears that thirty years ago this was not the case.  He argues for an historical approach, in contrast to what he calls a theological approach.  Whereas the latter would focus on Jesus in his New testament context and regard the rest of what was happening in the intertestamental years as background, Vermes takes the opposite view.  It is more historically valid and enlightening, in his view, to begin with what we know of the temporal and spatial setting and work back to the representation of Jesus in the synoptic gospels.  From that point we can excavate what we think represents actual speech and events in the life of Jesus and what is constructed by the evangelists (ie the synoptics, not John, which Vermes believes has almost no historical validity at all).<br /><br />I have said that I believe that Vermes is now mainstream - not necessarily that all his conclusions are accepted by the scholarly community, but that a more historically deductive approach is now common.  By historical deduction I refer to the process of discovery proceeding from the general historical context to the particular events and characters to be discovered.  My belief is not based on expertise, and is open to challenge from those who know better.  However, I recently completed a course in biblical studies at a Catholic university that used extensively recent scholarship that did exactly what Vermes was arguing for in the 70s and 80s, ie placed gospel-based interpretations firmly in the context of the time and place of their writing and of the broader contemporary Jewish world.  I would think it difficult for New Testament scholars now writing for a wider community to begin with a theological position and then proceed simply to find justification for it.<br /><br />Vermes writes well and with a degree of passion.  There is a degree of polemicism in his style.  His wit and pleasure in pith have got him into trouble with sober scholars who have taken him to task for insufficient deference to method or unsubtle summative statements.  This book begins with a self-defence from criticism by John Meier arising from a Vermes attempt to be humorous.  At another time he argues that people misrepresent him for understanding statements such as \\"Jesus was a Galilean Hasid\\" (p. 10) as implying that that's all he was, but it's not an unreasonable inference when considered in the light of Vermes' argument as a whole.  On other occasions, Vermes does make the explicit point that he thinks Jesus was in fact a Galilean Hasid, like Honi and Hanina ben Dosa, but much more as well (though still within the parameters of Hasidism).<br /><br />I have found the three books I've read by Vermes on Jesus enlightening and very readable.  They have helped me greatly to understand Jesus in his Jewish context without in any way lessening my faith in the value of Jesus' mission and its subsequent development in the mission of the Church.  I believe Vermes would see this as a reasonable outcome of his message to the reader.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my Fortress Press paperback copy ordered through Amazon fell apart almost immediately.  I've not come across such a poorly bound book in many years.  I hope it was a one-off, as I know Fortress Press is a quality publisher.

First of all, I'm a really big Star Wars fan.  I've read every novel as well as a few of the comics and have enjoyed nearly all of them (except for the novel Jedi Trial.  That was terrible).<br /><br />A few years ago I had taken a large break from reading Star Wars novels and last year around this time I started reading again.  So, I read all 19 of the New Jedi Order books back-to-back.  It was a grueling and rewarding experience.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this novel.  Troy Denning is easily one of my favorite Star Wars authors.  But for those of you who are not really huge Star Wars fans and are looking into reading this book there are a few books that I think you should read first in order to get maximum enjoyment out of reading this trilogy.<br /><br />If you want to get more background on Raynar Thul read The Young Jedi Knights series by Kevin Anderson and Rebecca Moesta.  Also, if you want to know more about Lomi Plo and Raynar check out New Jedi Order: Star By Star by Troy Denning.  If you want to learn more about Jacen Solo check out New Jedi Order: Traitor by Matt Stover.<br /><br />Now on to my review.<br /><br />You can imagine my excitement when I heard about this post NJO series by Troy Denning coming out.  I liked the 1st book in this series a lot and was looking forward to this one even more.<br /><br />In this 2nd novel in Troy Denning's post NJO series we find that the Gorog are not destroyed as we were lead to believe at the end of the 1st book (this is really no surprise since this is a trilogy after all).  This sets off mistrust between Cal Omas and the Jedi as well as a potential galactic war between the Chiss, the Galactic Alliance, and the Killiks.<br /><br />One story line involves Luke and Han trying to help the Killiks out with a major problem on one of the planets that Han and Leia gave to them at the end of Joiner King.  In with this story line is the continuing story line of Luke slowly unlocking recorded moments of his parents from Episode III.  A little twist is thrown in with the last one Luke sees in this book and makes me wonder exactly what Luke will find out about his father in the third book of this series.<br /><br />Another arc is one that involves Leia developing her Jedi skills with Master Saba.  I can't tell you how refreshing it is to see Leia as a Jedi.  In all of the other books I always had to read about how hard it was for her to be a senator over and over again.  It got really tiring.  So seeing Leia like this was a real breath of fresh air for me.<br /><br />A third major arc in this book is about Jacen.  This book finally solves the whole Jacen/Tenel Ka relationship once and for all in a pretty surprising manner.  We also get to see some of the powers that Jacen learned while being away from the Jedi for five years.  There is one scene between him and Tenel Ka's grandmother that is probably one of the coolest scenes in this book.<br /><br />The final arc worth mentioning involves Cal Omas and his growing distrust of the Jedi.  This was a very interesting plot point and one that takes the Cal Omas character on a very different path.  After reading the NJO series I really liked Cal Omas.  Now, after reading this book it seems that Cal Omas might not be as good as he seemed before.  In the end I believe this story line will actually bring some greater structure to the Jedi.  That's about as much of a spoiler as I'm going to give you.<br /><br />One thing that I enjoyed is that we get to actually see Ben Skywalker use the force in this book.  I won't ruin it for you but I think you'll like what you read.<br /><br />Overall this is one of the better Star Wars books out there.  Troy Denning does a great job of tying up some bothersome loose ends while weaving a very interesting story.  I highly recommend this book to those who are fans of the New Jedi Order series or just Star Wars fans in general.<br /><br />Until next time MTFBWY!arents from Episode III.

The book shifts between time frames, characters (band members, managers, friends, etc.) narrations, and bio facts to amusing and crazy stories pretty much each chapter. But it does this in a very cohesive way that makes this one of those books that is interesting and easy to blaze through. Whether for good or not, after reading this book it will definitely change your attitude and the way you act when you cruise the town. Not many books can do this but this book really will affect you...at least for a week or so.	2005-10-11

Freeh, the former FBI director(1993-2001), has put together a string of life's accomplishments, struggles, obstacles, and frustrations presented in the clarity of the moment, as he sees it.   <br /> <br />The chronicle is his own biography, and nearly half of the book encompasses educational background, and experiences with  New York city crimes while working in the US Attorney's office. But, make no mistake! The theme of the book craftily pivots on issues that involve his difficult relationship with Bill Clinton, who had chosen him, as a \\"law enforcement legend\\", and later regretful as his \\"worst\\" appointment. <br /> <br />Freeh graduated from the New York University Law Scool in 1975, worked as an FBI agent from 1975-1981, and then in the US Attorney's office in New York city until 1991. He was appointed as the US District Court from 1991-1993. <br /> <br />The book is interesting, informative, captivating, and easy to read. There is a hint of venom that Mr. Freeh carefully guards, as he delves into his chapter critical of his boss, his President, our President -- intelligent and politically skillful, but a crack in his thought process, which let the truth slip by...just slip by!  <br /> <br />The following are the highlights that troubled Mr. Freeh:  <br />>The Kobar Towers investigation in Saudi Arabia, which he believes Mr. Clinton ignored, and the interference in the probing of the matter...allowing the terrorists to escape. <br />>He is surprised by the underestimation of casualties by Mr. Clinton in his book \\"My Life\\"...by as many as 70...and even the misrepresentation or the inference that these terrorists were caught. <br />>Modernization of FBI computer system, requesting $90 million but only receiving two million. <br />>Pardoning of Marc Rich whose former wife donated one million to the Clintons. <br />>Scandels of the nineties, particularly the Lewensky scandle that plagued the presidency. <br />>Views on Robert Hanssen -- the double agent. <br /> <br />Freeh underscores the difficulties he had in dealing with his job, because of Mr. Clinton's never-ending scandels, rumors, and personal conflicts, which triggered FBI investigations. His views are forthright, and seemingly based on facts and candid  recollections. Understandably, perhaps, this book is in contrast to Mr. Clinton's \\"My Life\\", and ultimately it will be up to the reader to decide which one prevails. <br /> <br />Character does matter! The book is a credible source of information, and does indulge in the strengths of FBI and future imptovements. It is a worthy read and will no doubt cause some political repercussions and debates on the airways.    <br /> <br />     <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />     <br />	2005-10-11

I read the back cover and wanted to see how the author worked through the conflict. It was a bit slow to start (for me,) but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. The conflict with her sister's marriage was realistic and gut-wrenching, and I wish it had turned out with a happier ending, but hey, that's not reality. In regards to Hanna, I liked the way the author brought everything to a climax toward the ending. I felt Micah's pain as well as Hanna's. It is a wonderful story of forgiveness. Though it may seem unrealistic to some, I've known people in weirder situations. I liked the redemption piece and felt like the author handled the resolution beautifully.	2005-10-11

The philosophy was OK but not great and it was buried in a non-plot story.  The language, when used for philosophy was OK, but the rest of the time it was either tired and pedestrian or just plain potty mouth.<br /><br />The \\"story\\" revolves around the heart-broken author, who is down and out in Paris.  His life entails bumming enough money to score food, women and a place to sleep.  Naturally, as a down and outer, he constantly complains about the system without ever having the guts to do anything about it.  I was really surprised that his character never did anything given his vitriolic nihilism towards just about everything.  The irony of the character is that despite hating society and everything in it, he must beg in order to exist in it.  I would have never guessed that Miller was such a chicken anarchist.<br /><br />This book won its mark of importance because of its symbol of freedom of speech and I am fine with that, but it just felt a little contrived the way he threw around the C word and his degradation of women.  There are only so many ways to describe cold-hearted sex and after you get the idea, Miller, if it is autobiographical, keeps on bragging.<br /><br />There were many times I felt like I was reading \\"On the Road\\", but without all of the good times and the passion.  They both have a strong counter culture current, but OTR is down and happy while TOC is down and miserable.  If you have to pick one, go with OTR.  I would much rather hang out, philosophize, party and travel with JK than HM.	2005-10-11

Every once in a while i hear it on a mix tape and think, \\"what ever happened to Lisa Suckdog\\"?  I was in a bookstore yesterday when I saw some familair words in pink lettering on this book's spine and was staggered with vague memories.  Reading the copy on the back cover I was truly enticed and figured that for a few bucks it would be worth finding out \\"whatever happened\\".  I guess she never really went away and has fascinated a bunch of people younger than I and this isn't even her first book.  Nevertheless, in those great days before some loser named Kurt signed a big money contract, Lisa Carver was among a dingy pantheon of musicians (or whatever) who were truly fascinating, inspiring, and confounding to me.  I would not have guessed however that reading a memoir about one of the dingiest in the pantheon - glorious Pennyface notwithstanding - would be so fascinating, inspiring and confounding as well.  Her story is much more interesting than I would have guessed and she tells it with surprising eloquence and verve.  Any time she writes about her father is particularly riveting.  As for her life in the underground world...  Those days...  those days were incredibly fun and mysterious.  But her book reminds me that they were also desperate - emotionally and fiscally - and perilous.  The person who wrote this book 'got' at a young age that she could stare down the nightmare and come back for more just for the sheer aliveness of it all.  And that aliveness is all we have.	2005-10-11

Is The story of the Wizard of Oz told in a different light. It focuses on Elphaba, The future wicked witch of the west, instead of the usual characters of Dorothy and the gang. Elphaba is cursed with a terrible life. She has a terrible skin condition, sharp teeth and a mother who is repulsed by her. <br />This book is all about Elphaba's life and how she wants meaning and happiness. When she finds out about the Wizard and what he is doing, She wants to stop him. She makes it her purpose in life. To stop the Wizard and all he is doing. To make life better for her, and everyone. Throughout the book, you don't get one evil thought about \\"the wicked witch of the west\\" you feel sorry for her. That her mom was an alcoholic and repulsed by her, that she cant be touched by water, that she has skin that makes her different and hatted by people. Surprisingly, the book makes you feel sorry for Elphaba, It doesn't show her as wicked at all, but depressed, and yet.. still inspiring. It makes you want her to succeed in her mission. You want her to win so her life will be better. Elphaba isn't evil...just misunderstood. She had a horrible life. Who wouldn't want to try and make the world a better place? For her, and everyone one else.  <br />This book is very interesting and inspiring. I like it better than the original Wizard of Oz because it has a darker light on it, a depressing side. It helps you get to know the not so Wicked Witch of the West, that was portrayed as so incredibly evil in the original tale.  Definitely worth a read if your interested in fantasy and a lighter side of an evil witch.	2005-10-11

While I didn't pan the Fiery Cross as much as most, it was a bit slow but picked up halfway through.  This book, however, just grabs you and runs.   <br /> <br />Although I feel largely inadequate cricitizing writing that is obviously of such tremendous quality, I am compelled as a true \\"Gabaldonofile\\" to be honest.  While it was nice to see the focus shift back to the main characters, I did find a few things unbelievable.  (Although if one were to be honest, couldn't we argue that the entire story is such?)  :)   <br /> <br />SPOILER:  This time it was Claire's turn to be hovering near death instead of Jamie.  The kidnapping segment was awesome, and I couldn't help but get goosebumps when Jamie says, \\"It is I who kills for her.\\"  (Although to be fair, Jamie, she has done a pretty good job of killing when she's needed to both without and for you.)   <br /> <br />SPOILER:  Claire's bout with fever was also very exciting, although it seemed like Jamie and especially Brianna were almost, well, nonchalant.  I know that many might disagree, as the author goes out of her way to show Jamie's concern (shadows under the eyes and tears), but it just seemed odd to me that he would be out there splitting kindling and performing every day tasks while the love of his life was dying; he was in his study whilst Malva (had a hard time buying that whole \\"apprentice of the heart\\" storyline) was making eyes at him; why wasn't he up with Claire?  I guess one might say that Gabaldon portrays convincingly that life goes on no matter what, but darn it, Claire barely left his side through his (can it be only 5?) illnesses and near death experiences.  And we only got one brief touching scene with Brianna after Claire was on the road to recovery, although I suppose the assumption is that she she couldn't endanger her children in the sickroom.   <br /> <br />Again, SPOILER ALERT:  The goodbye scene at the end, particularly Jamie and Brianna, left a lump in my throat, but it also seemed a bit, well, abrupt.   <br /> <br />For the Lord's sake, Diana, please don't leave us hanging about William!  I found myself reading ahead to get to that part, having read the scene a year ago.  I cannot wait until the next installment. <br /> <br />Anyway, these are trifling matters.  Overall, this is an excellent read.  Far be it from me (a mere mortal) to question this author's choices.  But I think many of these reviews show how many of us feel such ownership of these characters.  Towards the end of the book I began feeling a bit sad; I'll have to wait another three years or so (or more!) to find out what happens to these people that I have been reading about for 11 years.  While it's rather embarassing to admit this, I feel as though Jamie and Claire have become friends of mine, and I am loath to part with them, which I think, says it all.   <br /> <br />Keep up the good work, Diana.  Your writing has really had a positive influence in my life.   <br />	2005-10-11

I saw this book as something I would read and then give friends so that they can understand the universal applications possible with a little bit of study of the \\"dismal science\\".  As an Economist myself, the synopses and reviews of this book hinted at something I was very much after - an accessible insight into the heart of economics, a vertibale bag of consumer psychology, decision making and allocating the scarce resources in our life more effectively.<br /><br />However upon reading this book it was rather disappointing.  Maybe my expectations were a little high, but it is a book which doesn't really talk about \\"economics for the punters\\".  It simply gives a couple of snapshots of society and talks about why or how these people make money, or organise their lives.  The problem is it gives absolutely no indication as to WHY these things occur.  It doesn't try and build a thesis for these actions, any type of continuum or a sense to the reader that this is simply a small and amusing glimpse into the world of economics.  There is no perceptible narrative or link - there is no sense of: \\"what is it about these stories which is about economic choice.  What have we discovered?\\"<br /><br />Levitt, being a skilled Economist, should have concentrated on economic theories such as the following and built anecdotes around them:<br /><br />Opportunity cost:<br /><br />The cost of doing something as measured against it's next best option.  Or in other words, \\"if I go out with my friends instead of going out on a date with that girl, is the \\"opportunity cost\\" that I might have blown a life long relationship for the sake of a big night out with mates?\\"<br /><br />Utility:<br /><br />What satisfies and at what cost?  So for example I might not want to risk spending money on an expensive dinner with a girl because if it doesn't work I'm much poorer, however something has been salvaged out of the night?<br /><br />Game theory:<br /><br />Choices that we make in life or in competition which can affect our future ability to make choices.  \\"So, do I plead guilty and lock in a lower jail term or do I state that I am innocent and risk a much higher jail term?\\"<br /><br />...and so many other \\"economic\\" concepts which are utilised by people every day all over the world without knowing it.<br /><br />Levitt obviously has a strong theoretical backing and a highly curious mind.

My main stumbling block was pronunciation and an over-emphasis on grammar. What I needed was an easier way to learn pronunciation and something that would be more natural to learn. I have found that in this CD set! <br /> <br />What this CD set does is teach you the language in a way that I think most humans learned to speak, by listening and repeating with an understanding what the words mean. It starts slowly, but does not so slow as you lose interest. On the contrary, these CDs keep your interest at every turn. First of all, each lesson is 30 minutes long, not too long as to lose interest and sharpness but long enough to give you a solid lesson. Next each lesson builds on previous lessons and quite often somethig you learned 90 minutes ago creeps up and makes sure you remember the whole course. <br /> <br />This is mostly a listening course. There is a tiny booklet included but its main purpose is to teach you to recognize the words you have already verbally learned. Just as a child learns to speak before reading, this course does the same thing. I would HIGHLY recommend this course to beginners and would recommend using this course ALONE before any other study aids. Once this course has been mastered then you can comfortably move on to other aids. Again, this is a great course!	2005-10-11

The part that bothered me most is in Chapter 90 (paperback). Alex is out with his kids for the day and LONGS FOR THE NINETEENTH CENTURY. He even mentions plantations. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Alex Cross is Black, yes? Why in the world would a Black American man wish for, no long for, the nineteeth century?

For what it is - no fuss, no muss, quick and easy cooking - this is a very good book.<br /><br />I resisted buying this one for awhile. I LOVE to cook and found it insulting at first, a book that relied so heavily on pre-made store bought ingredients ... then I started working full time and found that some days (okay, five out of seven of them!) I just do not have the time to cook as \\"in-depth\\" as I like to. So, rather than relying on re-heated homemade cooking (there's only so many times you can eat the same soup or chili) or constantly resorting to resturants, I gave this one a shot.<br /><br />The ideas are great; the menus built with recipes that compliment one another. Granted, they aren't very creative in the cooking process ... but that's something I adjust to fit my needs. A recipe calls for bottled sauce? I thaw some of my homemade sauce the night before. No fresh herbs added to a recipe when I think they'd really make the flavor pop? Well, then I just add some! Store bought cornbread? Pssh - I can at least take an extra 20 minutes to bake some from a mix! I don't follow every \\"recipe\\" to the letter; I make substitions with fresh foods when I have the time and the ingredients.<br /><br />All told, this is a great book to fall back on when things get hectic or to thumb through when you're looking for ideas.	2005-10-11

This is basically a dellusional, self-agrandizing book, in which Louis Freeh takes credit for things that he had very little hand in. <br /> <br />Louis Freeh claims to have fought terrorisim, the mob, and somehow managed to do all this while refusing to update the FBI with modern technology like say...COMPUTERS. <br /> <br />Apparently Freeh was so \\"Techno Phobic\\" he had a computer in his office removed, which is hardly the act of a \\"Visionary\\" FBI director. <br /> <br />Freeh takes credit for all sorts of things in this book, when is reality the brave FBI \\"Field Agents\\" were the ones doing all the work, without so much as a thank you from King Louis. <br /> <br />Freeh even shows his political partisanship in this book, by attacking Bill Clinton. Clinton picked Freeh for his job as FBI director, which Clinton now admits was \\"A huge mistake\\". History certainly has backed Bill Clinton up on this claim. The real reson Freeh investigated Clireeh attempts to put his nton so often, was because instead of using the FBI to fight the emerging threat of Islamic Terrorisim, he wanted to embarass and backstab a great President...not surprisingly Freeh is a Republican. <br /> <br />This book in an exercise in \\"CYA\\". louis Freeh left the FBI in such a state of decline, that Al Qaida was able to pull off the worst terror attack in history against the US. 9/11, is the REAL legacy of Louis Freeh.	2005-10-11

Even the information on the jacket sounded like it would be good. But then I got to the story itself and got to when they reintroduced Mina. Utterly disappointed me. Mina was redeemed at the end of the original book and to see her back as a bride of Dracula really disappointed me. Was not happy with that twist. <br /> <br />And John's personality shift was almost out of left field after he became a vampire. Was disappointed there as well. I had liked the character up until the point he let his step-mother (if you could call her that) seduce him into being a vampire. <br /> <br />I will admit that one of the few characters that moved me was Quincey Harker - but to change the origin of the character didn't seem to fit. I don't remember Mina being that intimate with Dracula in the original novel... <br /> <br />Would not recommend this book to any fan of the original novel.	2005-10-11

Schor's Born to Buy offers an in-depth examination of the way marketers target minors.  (Inexplicably, between hardback and soft cover it lost its subtitle: \\"The Commercialized Child and the New Consumer Culture.\\")  Some of it was enlightening; some of it was shocking; most of it was convincing; all of it was pretty interesting.  Schor may be a bit too speculative about the impact of commercialization from time to time, but even so she has the potential to spark dialogue, which is something society sorely needs in respect to the way we're brainwashing our children.  I live in a consumer-savvy household.  I've been educating my son since he was old enough to watch commercial television about the aims of marketers and the ways commercials mislead you.  Even so he's a patsy for every slick snake-oil salesman that comes along.  And it is disturbing that while I myself choose what to expose him to on television and in magazines that he reads at home, he might be forced to sit through advertisements in his classroom with no one to offer a balanced perspective on advertiser claims.  The halls of junior academia should most decidedly be safe zones, and commercial enterprises should not be allowed to bribe our educators into subverting the public trust.  Anyway, enough with my soap box.  Schor is better positioned on hers.<br /><br />I'd give this one 4.5 stars if Amazon would let me. Since it won't, I'll overlook what I perceive as minor weaknesses because they have little impact to the overall appeal and influence of the work.	2005-10-11

I used Henry Benjamin's CCIE R/S book when sutyding for my R/S written. I found that book totally lacking in any depth and sold it once I read through it in about 2 days. Once I read these reviews I thought he might have learnt from his mistakes. Spend the money and sadly got disappointed again. The book is more of an overview of the topics covered. You read through it like it's a comic book in no time at all. I found the material no where near the sort of depth I expected for a CCIE book. Remove all the crap about the R/S labs and cut out the 'About Exam' garbage filler in the beginning and give more depth to the material. 720pages which probably only has about 150 at the most worthwhile. Rather get the CCSP books in order to the cover the material to the level required. I understand that one book can't cover everything but then it should at least make a better attempt than this. If Jeff Doyle can do it then a triple CCIE should be able to. 1 Star for the 150pages and 1 star for the amount of questions included.	2005-10-11

In With No One as Witness she switches from her typical intimate family murder to a poorly-constructed serial killer tale. And, in a bizarre plot twist that strains credibility past the breaking point, she breaks up her extremely endearing group of long-running characters.  The  Thomas Lynley - Helen Clyde subplot has been the best and perhaps the most widely-followed  continuing side story in mystery fiction since Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane.  Why she ended it by killing off Helen smacks of creative breakdown to me; it's very disappointing that she could not have come up with any other way to create new dramatic conflict in her series.  I can't recommend this book,  nor, by anticipation, any of its sequels.  What a disappointment.	2005-10-11

Over the years since this, and many other stories by Barks, have appeared, they have come in many formats, of which the best is the COLLECTED  WORKS OF CARL BARKS, and now this series, including this title, comes in a nicely done cover, with Library  quality paper. I have copies of this in a previous  incarnation of the GLADSTONE  prints, prior to the Publishers going bust. Thankfully, someone has realised that these titles are being bought by Adults who could not afford the collected works, but who wanted a title done in a collectable  format that would last. Way too many versions of this title published since the late 50's and again in the 70s have been done on poor quality paper, and were  priced  accordingly.  This Ancient Persia  title works  well in this comic format, however, some of the titles  occurred originally in a strip format, and suffer when transferred  to the comic page format. However, I managed to get some of these titles in a \\"hard\\" cover binding that preserved the strip ratio, without resorting to the comic page ratio that was edited with apparently  little  thought ( these editions in original strip format came out about 1982-84, and as far as I am aware are not currently available anywhere... so I hope someone can examine some of the original  formats, and see what best goes back to the strip format).

This is a key concept and one that present (and often past) philosophers and theologians have not considered carefully. The mindset today is to contain an illness, to splice new genes into the old (new patches on old cloth?) with the conviction that the new will satisfactorily replace the old. However, there has to be, as Brown notes, restoration to God and ultimately our resurrection bodies will be like Adam and Eve's before sin overtook the world. In one sense restoration is figurative because we can't go back to Adam and Eve, but it is also literal because our \\"new\\" bodies will be recognizable when at the resurrection we are restored with God and taken out of a sinful world.	2005-10-11
US	20823367	RYAXKO9JD9IVC	0595359345	414643249	Aftermath of the Dead	Books	1	7	7	N	N	Absolutely the worst book I've ever read.	Seriously two chapters in and I was ready to toss it into the trash bin. But I forced myself to finish since I paid full price for it and so I could honestly review it.  <br /> <br />Aftermath of the Dead has numerous spelling mistakes, improper word usage (turn for torn) and grammatical errors on every page. Not to mention, sentences that are fragmented by commas and periods where they don't need to be, so you spend more time dechiphering what the author is trying to say, than what he is saying. Even a cheap editor would have gone a long way to making the AotD readable. <br /> <br />Add to it that the characters are one dimensional and the story is haphazardly told it just leaves you flat out not caring about them nor feeling much of anything at all. At one point, when a bunch of workers are surrounded by an incoming horde, the author point blank tells you that you could never understand the horror those men are facing. Way to make me empathize. <br /> <br />On a positive note, Smith did have some good ideas on his take on the zombies and I think he does have the potential to write a decent zombie book. Unfortunately AofD isn't it.	2005-10-11

SS-Gebirgs-Division "Prinz Eugen" im Bild ( 7th SS Mountain Division "Prince Eugene" in Photos )	Books	5	7	7	N	N	An Outstanding Waffen SS Single Unit History	Of all the various picture histories available regarding the Waffen SS, I found this volume on the 7th SS Mountain Division to be the most interesting. Much of that interest lies in the fact that there is not a tremendous amount of source material related to this division. It spent the war in a backwater front fighting Tito's Partisans. Most Second World War histories spend more time on Tito's men and very little on the German Units they faced off against.<br /><br />This volume tells the tale well from beginning to end and for once, the pictures are related to the subject. You won't find Totenkopf grenadiers at Kursh mislabeled here. And these are pictures that most of us have not seen before. There is also an operational energy to these pictures that is not often seen. The reader gets a glimpse into the unique logistics required to fight in the Karst regions of the former Yugoslavia.<br /><br />Another very interesting aspect of this volume, is the descriptions of the Banat region, from which many of the division's Volk Deutsch were recruited.<br /><br />Prior to owning this volume, my own previous knowledge of this division was very unfavorable. Many of the earlier, general histories of the Waffen SS labeled Prinz Eugen as a division guilty of extensive atrocities. While this volume does not spend any time on atrocities committed by the division, it is clear that war in Yugoslavia was an unremitting horror where quarter was neither offered or given by either side. The volume concludes with descriptions of the divisions' destruction and the executions or imprisonments of its survivors.<br /><br />One last note of interest is the fact that this volume contains the \\"infamous\\" photograph of Austrian Chancellor, Kurt Waldheim, which caused him so much political grief. Guilt by association....??? You be the judge.	2005-10-11

I found Chapters 4 and 5 (\\"Group Lenging\\" and \\"Beyond Group Lending\\" respectively) extremely useful for applied contract theorists.    The word \\"microcredit\\" refers manly to lending.  In Chapter 6 (\\"Savings and Insurance\\"), the authors introduce another concepts: savings and insurance.  In the following chapters to the end, they go on to various issues such as gender and goverment subsidy.    Overall, the book is an excellent survey of microfinace as it is.  Yet, it lacks a big picture, especially regarding the future of microfinance.  Whether the human society can keep microfinance on the sound truck will probably matter in the first order sense to how much human beings as a whole can prosper in the 21st century.  My own guess is that key to the  success will be a good combination of self-interest and sympathy to others, which is exactly the spirit of Adam Smith.	2005-10-11

This was the second book I ever read on the Beatles when I was sixteen years old, and when I re-read it twelve years later, having read another thirty or forty Beatles books in the interim, it only improved in my estimation.  The story of The Beatles is inherently romantic and dramatic and Norman's narrative makes fantastic use of those qualities.  The end of book is genuinely moving and sad.  I hope Paul reconsiders his opinion.

Where Brown concentrates much of his story on esoteric art and puzzle solving, Conspirators is more of an action story with time traveling heroes.  The time traveling technology is sketchy at best, but it serves its purpose well enough, which is to get a team of adventurers to the distant past to witness and record the crucifixion if Christ.  What they find is both astonishng and controversial, at least to some team members.  And they struggle with the fate of the information.  The book was written 7 years ago and shows its age, especially in the technology area.  Microcircuitry was certainly not the author's forte.  If this story were revised and marketed better, I believe it would have mass appeal.  Even though it tackles a touchy subject, the authenticity of the Jesus Christ miracle, with gusto, it does not preach or rant, but merely observes open-mindedly.	2005-10-11

But some of their interpretations of data are stretched a bit thin to fit their theories.    Regardless of any possible royal ancestry of Jesus, I really find it hard to believe that he had political aspirations. The Romans feared he did, since he was trying to unite the Jews philosophically, but that doesn't mean he did. Every indication is that his interests were spiritual.    I agree that Jesus was most likely married, since he spoke about the wonders of marital relationships, and never condoned celibacy. And I believe that Mary Magdalene was a dear friend and a valued part of his ministry. But I'm not convinced that Mary was the wife. Per the traditions of the day, Jesus was most likely to have married in his teens or early twenties at the latest, well before his ministry in Judea. This point is mentioned but not dealt with in this book. He met Mary Magdalene during his Judean ministry, when in his thirties.    The years during which he likely would have married and started a family are missing from the Bible. There is evidence elsewhere that he spent those years traveling in Persia, India and other exotic regions, gathering the wisdom of the world. Therefore, his wife might not have been Judean.    If a child feels insecure and finds a shiny coin, he might try to convince others that his treasure is very unique and special, and that only those who prove their friendship will get to partake in its magic. This is how I see the European \\"Holy Grail\\" fetish which developed 1000+ years after the time of Jesus. The history of the Templars, etc., to which much of this book is devoted, is amusng but not revelatory of Jesus or his wife.	2005-10-11

The first Sherlock Holmes book I ever read was given to me as a gift for my thirteenth birthday. It was a collection of the short stories, with a wonderful leather trim and gold leafing, and I thought it was fantastic. I read the first story, and was instantly hooked. Within a few days, I was disappointed with my wonderful new book because it was incomplete. I had devoured all of the selected stories, and was ready for more.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter, I purchased what purported to be the 'only complete Sherlock Holmes available', compiled by Christopher Morley. This became my favourite book. However, I have continued to collect editions of the Sherlock Holmes stories, and this is one of those collections. It does contain all the short stories, together with the illustrations from the Strand Magazine, which perhaps had as much to do with the way we view Holmes and Watson as does the text of the stories itself. It does not have illustrations or other commentary, and the print (in a double-column format) is rather small, but it is nonetheless a useful text for those who don't want to have a heavier book in their hands.<br /><br />The original stories, which appeared in The Strand magazine, were illustrated, by the great illustrator Sidney Paget.<br /><br />From the beginning introduction of Holmes and Watson to Holmes' gentle retirement to beekeepping on the southern coast of England, this book contains all the essential stories (none of the apocryphal, anecdotal, or tribute-written pieces are contained here). Holmes was often thought to be a real person, and Sherlockians the world over still search for 'evidence' to prove that he was. During his 'lifetime', the post office for the Baker Street area regularly received mail addressed to Holmes or Watson at 221B Baker Street. While such an address does not (and did not during the late Victorian era) exist, there is a business on the site that would be 221B, and they have dedicated a desk to Holmes, and strive to answer mail received in the great detective's name.<br /><br />Perhaps the two elements that made Holmes and Watson the world-renowned figures that they became are, first, the dominance of the British Empire globally at the time Conan Doyle was writing, which made English things sought-after, admired, and to be emulated, and secondly, the introduction of a method of detection hitherto unknown, both in the annals of detective stories (save perhaps in a proto-form in Poe and a few other obscure pieces of dubious literary merit) and in real life.<br /><br />Holmesian tales became required reading in the training of police and detectives in many parts of the world. It is still recommended even when it is not required.<br /><br />Holmes permeates other literature and venues as well. When Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation looks for images of Holmes, he is being guided by the descriptions in the stories as well as by the illustrations in The Strand. When the BBC produced Jeremy Brett's rendering of Holmes, the same holds true. When Basil Rathbone's films were cast, these illustrations and stories were uppermost in the directors' minds.<br /><br />So, pull some tobacco from your persian slipper, stoke your pipe, scratch out a tune on your violin, and re-enter the gas-lit world of the foggy London, where danger is afoot and one detective can always save the day.e to answer mail received in the great detective's name.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the two elements that made Holmes and Watson the world-renowned figures that they became are, first, the dominance of the British Empire globally at the time Conan Doyle was writing, which made English things sought-after, admired, and to be emulated, and secondly, the introduction of a method of detection hitherto unknown, both in the annals of detective stories (save perhaps in a proto-form in Poe and a few other obscure pieces of dubious literary merit) and in real life.  <br /> <br />Holmesian tales became required reading in the training of police and detectives in many parts of the world.

Joyce Pettigrew has done a terrific job. In an unbiased and a lucid manner she presents the affairs that rocked the state. I am a Sikh and lived in Punjab through the days of violence up until 2002. This topic has been written about by others who have either held a biased \\"state view\\" or biased \\"militant view\\". Sadly, none serves the purpose of truth. <br />I read the review of this gentleman Truth Seeker who sounds very hurt by what Dr. Pettigrew has written. His hurt results from his non-agreement with Dr. Pettigrew's view. He says \\"she never lived in Punjab as a commoner and never lost a friend or relative in vigilante violence\\", right he is and I hope that he understands, that this is what gives her an ability to have an unbiased view.  <br />So hurt is the gentleman that he goes to the extreme of using strong words like \\"dishonest\\", \\"crude\\", for the writer and \\"dastardly\\" for the people that she writes about etc. etc. He goes on to question the moral reasons behind the stance of the writer and sees the funding from the \\"terror lobbies\\" as a reason for that stance. His annoyance has taken away reasonable intellectual argument and has replaced it with an emotional character assassination. The gentleman digresses from the task at hand; he writes his views about the struggle rather than write a book review, probably not the place to do so. This gentleman, who happens to stand on the \\"other side\\" of the line, is not qualitatively different from the people who stand on the other side. Such emotional thinkers, will serve the purpose of perpetuation of the differences at best.	2005-10-11

I love being TOLD what I did during the 1st Gulf War, by someone who wasn't even there but because he's an historian it must be true!! <br /> <br />Geez what a moron! <br /> <br />The real history and power of this country is found in the American economy! <br /> <br />The anti-Southern bigots who think all they have to do is use the word SLAVERY or RACIST and they will automatically win the argument; have a difficult time with this book since Mr. Delorenzo cites his sources, but I doubt if that will slow or deter the true bigots and haters out there. <br /> <br />The book uses true scholarship and research and if they wish to ignore or deride then they can live on a flat planet and the rest of us will live in the real world. <br /> <br />Lincoln was not the great emancipator. He was not saving the country but destroying it and forever ensuring that the Constitition as intended by the founders would be a worthless piece of paper to be thrown away as so much garbage. <br /> <br />Using Lincolns own words and actions Mr. Dilorenzo shows Lincoln warts and all and those who attempt to apologize for Lincoln by saying all the other politicians in American history have lied and been dishonest miss the boat. To put Lincoln on a pedestal and worship him as a demi-god is pathetic to the extreme. <br /> <br />The people who slam this book are ignorant of the facts and are the kind of people who would burn this book if they were in power. <br /> <br />Just like Lincoln closed down newspapers and threw people into jail who disagreed with him and his desire to create a federal government that was centralized and all powerful.	2005-10-11
US	49148452	R15WFZEQG3GPFW	0374306729	377606443	Beekman's Big Deal	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Beekman's world	It's exceedingly painful to read a funny, intelligent, thoughtful book like, \\"Beekman's Big Deal\\", and know that in two  months you probably won't be able to recall the plot.  I was halfway through Michael de Guzman's excellent tale before I realized that though I was thoroughly enjoying myself and downing each consecutive chapter like popcorn, I was not retaining much in the process.  This is not to fault Mr. de Guzman.  Creating really well-written contemporary children's literature is an extraordinarily difficult task.  And though I might harp on its transience, \\"Beekman\\" is a fine frolicsome novel.  A book that takes seriously the problems that kids face when they're forced to move from place to place.  This is a story with many problems, but with such likable narration that the reader is not necessarily going to notice these minute flaws.<br /><br />When your name is Beekman O'Day, you've got problems right from the start.  But Beekman could probably live with his off-putting moniker if some of the other things in his life were going okay.  Problem is, they aren't.  His father has this crazy idea that Beekman should only attend private schools.  What ordinarily happens though is that Beekman will just start getting comfortable somewhere until his dad can't afford either the tuition or the place where they're staying and the boy will be whisked off somewhere else.  After more than twelve years of this, Beekman's fed up.  He's just arrived at the Chance School and is living in a lovely little mews.  They finally have their own house in Nutting Court, a cobblestone alley filled with interesting people.  But does Beekman dare get comfortable when he knows how unreliable his dad can be?  Or does he start trusting people once again?<br /><br />For the first two-thirds of the book, de Guzman's on a roll.  You're completely with Beekman all the way.  Whether he's trying to squirm out of a friendship with an annoyingly ingratiating student or running pell-mell down the streets of NYC to get to class on time, you're rooting for the guy.  About the time the school bully starts picking on Beekman full-time, however, the book starts to loose traction.  Then, when you reach the end, you feel that there are multiple narrative strands left ah-blowing in the wind and not enough of a conclusion to justify its cliffhanger last sentence.  It's as if \\"Beekman's Big Deal\\" starts off strong, but can't sustain that energy much farther than 140 pages in.  This is especially frustrating when you consider what a great book it is.  It has wonderful potential.  There are plenty of books out there about kids trying not to trust in people so they won't get hurt.  \\"Pictures of Hollis Woods\\", \\"Ruby Holler\\", and \\"The Great Gilly Hopkins\\" all come to mind, but those are all books about orphans trying not to trust.  \\"Beekman's Big Deal\\" had the advantage of having a very charming and completely untrustworthy father playing with his son's life like it doesn't matter in the long run.  What I would have loved to have seen was somebody showing Mr. O'Day the problems associated with this.  No one even tries, and the ending is less meaningful as a result.  I respect de Guzman's attempts to write a book where (like in real life) not everyone's problems are solved lickety-split in a miraculous finish.  I just wish he'd put more time into explaining why this is.<br /><br />The beating that public schools (or, to be more exact, New York Public Schools) receive in this book is also not to be ignored.  Again, Mr. O'Day is under the impression that to enroll his son in a public school is some form of failure.  It would have been nice if an alternative view had been presented at some point in the story.  Instead, we're supposed to support this fickle man and the book suffers from an age old money-laden stereotype.  Ugh.<br /><br />I'm being so harsh, aren't I?  I tend to be harsh when I'm disappointed in something.  I was disappointed in \\"Beekman's Big Deal\\", because itreally seemed like this was going to be a truly memorable and wonderful jolt of reality (with a heaping helping of humor).  Instead, it starts strong and it ends limping.  I still recommend it though.  Plenty of people are going to disagree with me about the ending, and the first two-thirds of the story are so good that they almost overwhelm my opinion of it.  Whatever the case, I still urge you to find a copy of this book at your local library and to give it a whirl.  You may find it's everything you've ever hoped for.  Or you may simple discover that's its flawed, but still a wonderful ride.  I'm in the latter category.really seemed like this was going to be a truly memorable and wonderful jolt of reality (with a heaping helping of humor).  Instead, it starts strong and it ends limping.

He is out to prove that no group of people is any \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" than any other group.  To meet this end, he argues that geography and geography alone is responsible for the success of some cultures and the failure of others.   <br /> <br />Sure, geography might be the correct explanation.  Another possible explanation, and one that is far simpler, is that some groups of people, on average, innately possess abilities that others don't.  In today's day and age, this is very politically incorrect.  Nonetheless, it should be addressed. <br /> <br />The author does address this latter theory.  It takes him about a page and half to dismiss it based not on science, not on any sort of study, but on his personal observation that certain aboriginal people, who belong to cultures we might not find advanced, are in fact more intelligent, on average, than caucasians.  He came to this conclusion by observing their ability to navigate through the woods (and the fact that their children don't grow up watching TV). <br /> <br />To me, this isn't science.

Because of Leo Carey's wry, admiring, melancholy essay in THE NEW YORKER, I grabbed this novel and its two sequels when I found them at a local used bookstore, and oh, how I wanted to like them more than I ended up doing. But they're just not as good as the hype. They drift all over the place [to be fair, Carey admitted that devotees of mysteries would find these books too undisciplined], and the narrator's aggressively amoral personality -- imagine P. G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster crossed with Jonathan Gash's Lovejoy -- can wear on one after a while. The plots are made of Swiss cheese, at best, and these books are also sadly dated in their views of women.

In this mind-opening book, Lynne McTaggart's has written a timely and comprehensive guide to the newest revolution in scientific thinking. Even a couple of decades ago, the types of science discussed here would have been laughed away by the scientific establishment as a hoax. Not anymore. The reader gets a good introduction to quantum mechanics, zero-point energy, and subtle-energy science. McTaggart covers a wide range of areas related to the latest thinking in physics about the \\"zero-point field.\\" This includes diverse subjects such as biology, astrophysics, and medicine. Specific examples that McTaggart delves into include homeopathy, remote viewing, biophoton emission, and holography.<br /><br />I found her history of the earliest days of the remote viewing project with Targ and Putoff at SRI especially interesting. Likewise, her discussion of Benveniste's homeopathy and Fritz Popp's coherent photon emission theory are equally fascinating. The promise of this work is that it has the potential to show us the connection between our consciousness and the material world. The prospect that humans have the ability to modulate their consciousness in some way so as to connect with a background energy field in the universe is an empowering one. If you are keen for new ideas, this book will knock your socks off. Overall, this is one of the best introductions around on the subject of new science and readers of all types are bound to find it a captivating one.<br /><br />(Dr. Simeon Hein is the author OPENING MINDS: A Journey of Extraordinary Encounters, Crop Circles and Resonance and PLANETARY INTELLIGENCE: 101 Easy Steps to Energy, Well-Being, and Natural Insight)	2005-10-11

In this modern era, dads are often left out of the picture (or the picture book).  Yet this book shows the beautiful interaction of a father and his 4 children (not to mention the family dog).  All the members of the family work together to help each other during the adventure.  They aren't running off it different directions, but they all have the same goal.   <br /> <br />But where's the mother?  I'm assuming dad gave her a much needed break, and she is off enjoying some quiet time somewhere.  And dad used the opportunity to take the kids on an adventure! <br /> <br />I suppose the moral of this story could be that we need to face our issues head on instead of going around them, but when I'm reading this book with my three boys, I'm not thinking of any grand moral to be taught.  I am just enjoying the time with them, as we embark on an exciting family adventure like no other!	2005-10-11

When you instinctively know something is wrong for your child, you face these huge questions: Is there something so wrong that he \\"needs professional help\\"?  How do I explain what is wrong?  Are they going to want to give him drugs?  Are we doing something wrong at home?  This book explains different types of depression and other mood disorders and also describes how various symptoms look in children, and even different at different ages. It explains different types of treatment options objectively so YOU can figure out where to start to understand and help your child. Unexpectedly, it has also explained some parts of my own childhood; didn't change anything for me now, just makes more sense.  But MOST importantly, now I think I can help my son.	2005-10-11

(Bradford Books)	Books	2	25	27	N	Y	Interesting but replete with hasty argumentation	The main thesis of this book, asserted repetitively, is that the mind is a computer program.  Once this is borne in mind, pardon the alliteration, most of the book is reduced to an argument in its favour, rather than an investigation into its credibility. The book often reaches for blunt assertions to support its positions and only afterwards begins a slight retracing of steps.  For example, we are told that inductive bias and learning algorithms are coded into the genome. It is obvious, bit of speculation on DNA, evolution and algorithms and out comes the result!<br /><br />In his observance of Occam's Razor, the author confuses the appeal of the simplest explanatory hypothesis with the belief that he has found such.  The discussion of neural networks leaves aside recurrent networks, which are probably more biologically plausible than competitors.<br /><br />Likewise the idea that the brain essentially 'runs' compressed programs due to evolutionary endowments is unconvincing and philosophically leaky.<br /><br />I don't want to be over critical of the book as it has brought together many interesting strands of work, but it just has not woven them into anything interesting.  There is little new here, whether from modularity or evolutionary programming constraints on neural activity.  A lot of it is speculative and several of the key themes are discordant due to under analysis of their assumptions.<br /><br />Several of the elaborations verge on the frivolous.  For example, there is a particularly woolly argument linking the learning of Scheme to \\"what goes on in constructing our understanding of the world\\" (p. 222).  Likewsie in discussing awareness and consciousness, the author relies on the use of 'main' in C to metaphorically explain how information might come together in the brain (p. 413-415).  All kinds of reification fallacies come to mind, leaving aside the thinnes of the argument.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the book pursues a strong cognitivist program (the brain is a computer) without convincingly examining various sides of the argument. I was certainly no wiser off at the end of it.gnitivist program (the brain is a computer) without convincingly examining various sides of the argument.

Justine Musk is that voice.  Her new novel, BloodAngel, is a gripping tale of beauty, terror, and empowerment.  Winged with a vision all her own, she rises above the many writers who have in past years ridden piggyback on the success of Lauryl K. Hamilton and the Buffy the Vampire franchise.  Don't let BloodAngel's stylish cover fool you into thinking that this is just another Kim Harrison or Sherrilyn Kenyon novel.  This is not another romance dressed up in Goth chic.  Do pay attention to the cover blurb by Poppy Brite.  BloodAngel is as strikingly original as Brite's \\"Lost Souls\\" and as wildly imaginative as the novels of China Mieville.  Her characters are fully-fleshed and mesmerizing, you either fall in love with them or love hating them.<br /><br />The story starts and ends in the blasted desert, the Mojave wasteland held up as a mirror to the urban wasteland of modern day America-the drug culture, the cult of personality, the self-induced anesthesia of a drug-addicted youth culture.  In the desert, everyone is looking for the next messiah.  And the next messiah is coming in the form of Asha, a blonde femme fatale and literal devourer of hearts.  Asha is, a refugee from the war between Heaven and Hell, and she has come to offer not redemption but judgement.  The cast down goddess, rejected by her immortal family and degraded as a slave, has had centuries to nurse her rage. She seduces Lucas, a down and out heroin addict from a rock band that never made it, and replaces his addiction for the drug with addiction to her power.  She has the voice of a fallen angel, an inhuman voice haunted with the sighs of the abyss, and the music she creates with Lucas possesses  legions of fans-- legions that will become host to demons when Asha sings open the doorway to Hell.<br /><br />Enter Jess Shepard, a gifted painter from Manhattan, who has become obsessed with the image of a beautiful boy, a tragic Kouros that haunts her dreams.  Her blood culls his image from the void between the worlds, the Dreamlines.  Jess soon discovers that she is the descendent of the Summoners, a race of noble sorcerers with immortal blood in their veins.  The boy, like Asha, is an angel in a human husk.  He is Asha's ancient enemy, the only one with the power to stop the blood apocalypse.  The war will be fought on Tantric grounds, the cosmic annihilation of the masculine joined to the feminine.  From destruction comes creation, but if Asha gets her way, the new universe will be an inferno of fire and endless suffering.<br /><br />In Jess' quest to find the boy, she discovers her own power--the power of creation.  Her guardian, Kai, who has secretly protected her from her youth, opens doors within her that lead to magic, ecstacy, and a forbidden love that transcends worlds both mortal and immortal.e obsessed with the image of a beautiful boy, a tragic Kouros that haunts her dreams.

I read a lot, most of it this sort of thing, horror, vampires, supernatural mysteries.  For anyone who does much reading, this book is troublesome.  The dialogue is ridiculous.  Its so poorly written that about half way through, i hardly came to a page that i didn't roll my eyes and close the book for a second or more before forcing myself to continue.  I kept hoping it would redeem itself, but it didn't.  It seems as if it has no form.  The only thing giving it any kind of flow is that it happens chronologically.  Otherwise, the scenes are oddly placed and you find yourself wondering what in the world one scene has to do with another.  The characters were flat and lifeless.  The main vampire, Bill, was faceless and invisible to me.  I could not see him in my head as i read the story.  In fact, none of the characters registered with me.  If you are reading a well written book, for instance, something from Stephen King, you can see every detail so much so that i often cannot remember if i have seen a movie version of a S.K. book or if i only read it because the movie is already there in my mind.  So... bottom line, stick to the Anita Blake series for fun in vampire land.	2005-10-11

The body is a gift, and Michelle appreciates its functions and clearly respects what the body can feel or do at times, protecting it from harm at others.<br /><br />Michelle's poems on her faith reveal her love for God and her expression of it in worship through her Jewish customs, practice and holidays.

He wrote the following in \\"The River War,\\" memoirs on the campaign to avenge the murder of Gordon, retake the Sudan, and finish off the Khalifa, the Mahdi's successor.<br /><br />\\"The long and glorious defense of the town of Khartoum will always fascinate attention. That one man, a European among Africans, a Christian among Mohammedans, should by his genius have inspired the efforts of 7,000 soldiers of inferior race, and by his courage have sustained the hearts of 30,000 inhabitants of notorious timidity ... is an event perhaps without parallel in history. It may safely be predicted that no one will ever write an account that will compare in interest or in detail with that set forth by the man himself in the famous \\"Journals at Khartoum.\\" The brief account has delighted thousands of readers in Europe and America. Before the first of six parts into which the Journals were divided is finished, the reader has been won. Henceforth he sees the world through Gordon's eyes.

Rudolph Slatin the Austrian officer appointed Governor of Darfur and who converted to Islam to motivate his troops before finally surrendering to become the prisoner of the Mahdi, the man whom the religious Gordon could not forgive for denying his God, survived to write his own memoirs, \\"Fire and Sword in the Sudan,\\" in which he decribes how the severed head of Gordon was brought to Slatin before being taken as prize to the Mahdi.<br /><br />From the time I first learned of General Gordon's famous stand to the death, I wondered why he did not choose the blow up the palace, himself inside, rather to submit to the fanatic Mahdi, who had the nasty habit of forcing his foreign captives to convert to Islam, something unthinkable for Gordon. [Greek nuns in the Mahdi's hands converted and even married priests to avoid sexual violation. The Pope would throw fits, remarked Gordon.] In his journals Gordon writes that he did consider blowing himself up with his close servants as a way to avoid what he was convinced would be a long period of captivity and abuse. He decided to stand his ground because the other option smacked of suicide, which does no one any good, and because that \\"might be seen as trying to take my fate out of God's hands.\\" Thankfully his death was immediate, not what he had anticipated.

Valente, Yume No Hon: The Book of Dreams (Prime, 2005)<br /><br />Sometimes I feel as if I should have a \\"five-and-a-half star\\" ranking. I've given a lot of books five stars in the past couple of years-- more five-star reviews than I'd given out in the decade before, almost. (Blame my getting a library card again, and thus not being limited to my own books.) But there are some books that transcend even the five-star rating, that are not only outstanding works of art, but that are so beautifully written that they deserve a place on the short shelf of sacred literature. The benchmark, for me, of this trait has long been Wendy Walker's The Secret Service, the book I consider the most beautifully written and constructed book I've ever read. Yume No Hon: The Book of Dreams is the first book I've come across since reading The Secret Service that rises to the same level.<br /><br />Throw away your conceptions of what a novel is before cracking the cover on this one. All the stuff you got taught in English class, chuck it out the window. Yume No Hon is character study in its purest form. The problem is, you've got an autobiography from the most unreliable of narrators (cf. Lauren Slater's Excellent Lying, to which this bears a passing resemblance more than once, were our main character epileptic and living in America); every time you think you've got an answer as to Ayako's real nature, you're likely to turn around and find yourself with many more questions. It's the mimetics of creative nonfiction, but turned around and attached to fiction; is Ayako dying and delirious, or possessed by powerful spirits? Is she ghost, hermit, memory, God? Ultimately, the answers to the questions don't matter (though the very end of the book does offer the reader a chance to resolve them); the journey, rather than the destination, is the point here.<br /><br />And what a journey it is. Valente's language is lush, rich, precise, every word slotted into place with painstaking care. While reading this, I found myself with a constant sense of overwhelming rightness in word choice (\\"rightness\\" here as opposed to \\"suitability;\\" a Dennis Lehane or George R. R. Martin novel contains suitable language, but the sentences could be phrased in many ways and still get the point across; the right language is that place where you think that there really is no better way to phrase something). The book is rich with striking, original metaphors and turns of phrase that will have the lover of beautiful language scrambling for a notebook to copy it all down. Buy two, actually; you may end up filling one completely before you're done.<br /><br />While the one negative effect of all this is to highlight the book's few typos (and, comparatively, there are very few; if memory serves, I found five, and two of them were arguable), this is one of those exceptionally rare pieces of work where stumbling upon a typo became something forgivable.<br /><br />Yume No Hon belongs with Walker's The Secret Service, McCarthy's Blood Meridian, Koja's Strange Angels, and a handful of other novels on the short shelf of sacred literature-- the first stuff you save when your apartment catches fire. It is a small jewel, to be read, pondered, re-read, and (for novelists) aspired to. Find a copy. Read it. *****ng care.

This book is part of an ongoing series of texts from Microsoft that offers education as to the best use of .NET. The book tackles one of the main problems of computing. Namely, how to write code that will be put into libraries and reused by many others? Arguably, this might even be the central problem in many computing projects.<br /><br />The guidelines given in the text should strike the reader as very much common sense. Take these, for instance: \\"Do not require that users perform any extensive initialisation before they can start programming basic scenarios\\", or \\"Do provide good defaults for all properties and parameters\\". If you have programmed in any language, you should readily agree with guidelines like these.<br /><br />The guidelines also include an excellent discussion about the naming of classes and methods in those classes. This is quite general; applying to any object oriented language like C++ or Java. Indeed, if you program in those languages, consider looking up this chapter of the book for useful hints.<br /><br />The book also continues a nice practice of the earlier books in the series. It has many sidebars with different people offering informal remarks about the adjoining text. Commentaries that can greatly help your assimilation of the material.	2005-10-11

Finally someone has addressed this issue with great inspiration, wisdom and humor.  Beautifully designed for the eye, helps to soften the harshness of some of life's realities.  This book sends a message of treasuring and cherishing each and every age that we're blessed with.  When you think in terms of IF...IF we're lucky, we may have 82 or so different ages in life...so why not celebrate each and every one of them for its own uniqueness? Granted, it seems more appealing to welcome the 35th than the 82nd.  If RIPE teaches us anything, it is to embrace the older years with all of our gusto... I suppose that's the definition of grace.  Thank you ladies for starting what I see as a movement, an appreciation, a CELEBRATION of exactly where we are.  And for sharing what one of your subjects said, that one of life's little secrets is that older women are the coolest on the planet.  I have bought a dozen copies of RIPE for my girlfriends for Christmas.  Bravo to two of the most remarkable RIPE women, Charlotte Moore and Janet Champ. <br />	2005-10-11

No other civilization on earth has waged two world wars with God on each side. To take just one of many examples, consider the Nazi slogan, \\"Gott Mit Uns\\" (God With Us) used to justify murderous activities from 1933 to 1945.   <br /> <br />Those who still refuse to accept Christian responsibility for the Nazi Holocaust need to read Rabbi Richard L. Rubenstein's \\"After Auschwitz,\\" or \\"The Cunning of History\\" to come to grips with the ways in which religion can be used as a tool of mass death. (Another useful supplement to the book under review is Hannah Arendt's \\"Origins of Totalitarianism.\\"  <br /> <br />As Arendt persuasively argued, World War I, World War II, the Holocaust, and Stalinism all sprung from the deepest cultural and historical tendencies of Western Civilization.

This 'trekker' tribute was written by a Buddhist-loving fan of all genres in which 'Star Trek' appeared from 1966 on.  He lived in  Kathmandu for awhile and is a fan of Dalai Lama, also.  He mentions the science fiction writer, Arthur Clarke as a guide to the motorcycle cop who invented the land of Captain Kirk and his crew along with the 'Enterprise.' <br /> <br />In 1997, Gene Roddenberry's ashes, along with those of LSD guru Timothy Leary and twenty-two other individuals whose families paid $4,800 for the tiny tubes the size of a cigar as they were fired into orbit aboard a Pegasus rocket.  After six years, that would make it 2003, the satellite would become a shooting star as it disintegrated into the night sky.  He had higher dreams for Roddenberry's (The Great Bird) legacy, \\"they should be tucked into the armature of some interstellar probe, with digitally encoded episodes of the 'Star Trek' series. <br /> <br />From the comic books to the t.v. series, the crew are still a part of the lives of fans in obscure areas of the world.  The movies were not as well-received, reaping almost $100,000 for one of them.  Examples of the show's lingo can be heard in Belfast, Tokyo, Berling, London -- anywhere television can be seen. <br /> <br />The 'Enterprise' may be the most famous vehicle since Noah's Ark; more popular that Dr. Who's telephone time-travel box, and Mrs. Peel's fancy car, even Get Smart's shoe phone.  England's rocketeer can't be more newsworthy than Homer Hickman of West Virginia ('October Sky' film was made in Knoxville and the surrounding area).  The stars are gone now, but the spirit will live on. <br /> <br />Since I didn't watch any of the t.v. '60s series (though my boys did), I saw some of the movies.  \\"Beam me up, Scotty\\" was Greek to me, a landlubber.  That space lingo sounded more like Fred & Wilma (Betty & Barney) in prehistoric fantasy world.  Now, I did see all of the 'Star Wars' movies. <br /> <br />Jeff Greenwald's 'Star Trek' was a place\\"where humanity's highest calling was exploration\\" (like America's real space program) and its values were freedom and compassion.  In America, we have a semblance of freedom but compassion is sorely lacking.  Only a made-up comic book world can have both simultaneously.  Jeff has also written FEARLESS SALES, SIZE OF THE WORLD, and SCRATCHING THE SURFACE (2002).	2005-10-11

Largely due to the very specialised nature of what they want to do. Linux is no exception. This book stands far afield from a typical linux sysadmin text.<br /><br />The authors choose to explain for two chip sets. Namely for the Intel x86. Natural and obvious, given Intel's domination of the microprocessor market. As for a second choice, there are many contenders, like the Alpha or the ARM chips. But instead, the book describes the PowerPC, which is prominently backed by IBM and Motorola. I suspect this choice might have been influenced by one of the authors being at IBM. Arguably, a credible alternative is the chip set from AMD.<br /><br />But the main thrust of the book is to offer a top down view of linux, drilling as close to the hardware as possible. The code excerpts are in C. (Very little kernel development seems to be done in other languages, and this book is no exception.)<br /><br />At the lowest level, you are shown how to access the drivers in /dev/, which in turn access the hardware. For example, one code fragment explains the reading of the real time clock on the x86. For some developers who might be used to dealing in pure software, these hardware interaction examples may be the most valuable portions of the text.<br /><br />Another merit of the book is presence of 2 architectures that are described. If you are developing for another chip set, the text may still be quite useful. You get 2 case studies here of how linux works. Contrasting these might give insight into what changes you need for your chip set.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely an advanced book. Having a strong background in C coding is a plus.	2005-10-11

This is one of those books filled with those ideas that you've thought all your life but few have the courage to admit, even to themselves.    Nietzsche takes a brutally honest look at human nature including the uglier things.  He rightly shows no mercy towards clergy and the morality of self negation and pity.  All is done in a beautiful, poetic style.    The moral of the story is to be above the masses, to go above your limits and to enjoy yourself while doing it.

Lipstick Jungle by Candace Bushnell: <br /> <br />Lipstick Jungle is the third novel by Candace Bushnell that I've read.  The first was Four Blondes; the second was Trading Up.  Four Blondes wasn't that great, but it wasn't awful.  I thought I hated Trading Up when I finished reading it, but when I look back, I actually liked it a lot.  If a book has the ability to make me want to finish it as quickly as that book did, then it must be good! <br /> <br />On to Lipstick Jungle: Very good.  I liked how it tied in characters from Trading Up, basically building on a New York we were already familiar with.  This was done in such a way though that was kind of annoying, but good all the same.  In explanation, we get to read about Selden Rose, and there is mention of George Paxton and Victor Matrick, as well as of Janey Wilcox but without ever saying her name.  The reintroduction of Selden almost instantly led me to the conclusion that he and Wendy would eventually end up together and I thought that was great!  We already knew what we needed to know about Victor Matrick, so nothing new was learned here.  What I thought would have been nice is that we could have found out whether Mimi's baby ended up being George's and they stayed together, or if the baby was actually Izzi's and they separated, or stayed together even!  I'd like to have had that loose end tied up!  Also, as much as I despised Janey, I would have liked to have found out what happened to her when she went to Los Angeles.  I realize this book was about a new set of characters, so I'm okay with all of that though. <br /> <br />Of the three main characters, Wendy, president of Parador Pictures, Nico, editor-in-chief and CEO of Verner, Inc. and Victory, fashion designer, I liked Wendy's story the best.  The other two story lines were good, but they just seemed so one-dimensional.  We saw Wendy's character go through the most, and end up with something completely different from how she started.  With Nico and Victory, their story lines were just so vague and almost boring.  I would like to maybe have seen three separate books, each fully dedicated to one of these characters, actually.  Where we actually get to know these women better.  Sort of how Four Blondes was followed by Janey's story in Trading Up.  Maybe that could come in the future? <br /> <br />I like Candace Bushnell's writing style.  At first, her constant use of parentheses annoyed me, but then I think I'm finally used to it.  It's a good way of being more descriptive, or of sharing a hidden meaning that some readers may not have caught on to.  It's the way I find myself wanting to compose e-mails, etc. to ensure the readers get my every intention! <br /> <br />In conclusion, I recommend Lipstick Jungle to women who enjoyed Trading Up, and to those who did not enjoy Trading Up.  The two books are different in that the characters of Lipstick Jungle are all likeable.  But don't let that stop you if you're a woman who loves to hate the protagonists of her fiction!  Also, this was a pretty quick read in comparison to Trading Up. <br /> <br />I'm ready for more from Candace Bushnell. <br />	2005-10-11

Yet counting their blessings the Baudelaire orphans, they felt lucky to be in a home with somebody that scared they actually feel secure. Until they came to a market one day and meet the Captain Sham, with a patch on one eye and a peg as one leg. but we all knew who exactly Captain Sham was, of course Aunt Josephine wasn't very keen to believe the children.<br /><br />One day, Aunt Josephine died, death cause, jumping through the window, leaving the three of them to Captain Sham (Count Olaf in disguised), and they knew Mr Poe wasn't very keen to actually believe Captain Sham was Count Olaf in disguise (He simply believed they kids are hallucinating and seeing him everywhere).<br /><br />The orphans tries to figure out a way to escape from the clutches of Count Olaf again when they discovered their aunt was still alive and was in hiding, somewhere. So they tried to get to her and tried to convince her to come back out to the world.<br /><br />If you are looking for a happily ever after kind of ending for your kids, I suggest you look away from this series.

They were vibrant, alive and drew the young reader's imagination into the tale. My nearly 5 yr. old grandson spent hours just staring at the illustrations, noting the details that made the characters come alive to him. I'm sure this will be a favorite book for a long time to come.	2005-10-11

But as a science supporter, but a Darwin critic, I was a little alarmed by the bad advice the author received from the very peer review bodies he promotes. The problem is that, for example, global warming, about which the book is excellent, and evolution, the most confusing of the issues, are not really in the same category. We can demand science on the issue of global warming, and expose conservative fraud, but if we demand science on evolution, then we should subject the current reign of Darwinian theory to scrutiny, there to find that, as theory, its scientific status is open to question. The behavior of creationists is a very distracting noise here, because it drives science defenders further into dogma, and into a hole. The author shows how relying on the standard sources of science advice, like the NCSE, will simply fill your head with the Darwinian boilerplate syndrome, which, whatever else their failings, the rightwing critics are well aware of. Having studied Darwinian theory carefully from the suppressed science critics they realize that they can trump the wrongly educated Dawkins/science generation. It seemed impossible ten years ago, now it's happening. Time to wake up on Darwin's theory, which means accepting the reality of evolution, but looking critically on the theory of natural selection. Science journalists ought to learn to be skeptical of the failed peer review system in biology and evolution. It's going to be the undoing of science, and one dreads to think what the next ten years will bring.<br /><br />Beyond that, many of the other issues raised make for an insightful expose, it is a pity the author is suckered into the Darwin trap.	2005-10-11

Said reviewer needs to go back and read both books again.  Although the 1937 edition adequately describes the Jones' theory and is recommended, the 1952 edition is a rewrite which incorporates the results of another 15 years of instruction experience by Jones.  A discerning reader will find it to be better organized and more thorough, particulary the chapter on obstacles to the swing.  As far as the reviewer's comments that one needs to go further, this person has missed the whole point of the Jones' technique.  When I was first introduced to \\"Swing the Clubheas\\" I was told that \\"if it is not in there, you don't need to know it.\\"  Today, more than 20 years later, I teach via the Jones' method and can say that if one truly applies oneself, all that needs be done in the swing will be done; you need do nothing else but \\"swing the clubhead.\\"  A true understanding of the technique, however, is not obtained by a casual reading of the book and an impotent effort to understand and apply the idea; it requires some time and a sincere effort.  Fine wine is not produced by crushing some grapes and dumping them into a vat for ten minutes.  It takes time to mature.  The Jones' technique is infallible and complete if diligently applied, and, if it is not in there, you truly don't need to know it.	2005-10-11

I had forgotten how good this album is. There were lots of good insights into Springsteen's creative process particularly how he was more successful when he started to pare down his lyrics for works such as Born in the U.S.A. There's fine research on the genesis of songs such as the title song. Also, there is a lot of additional information on the making of Nebraska, one of Springsteen's best works. You have to laugh when you read how politicians and pundits like Ronald Reagan and George Will praised the work of Springsteen at the time. They didn't quite get it. Finally, there is an excellent discography of Springsteen's work at the end of the book. A great read which I thoroughly enjoyed	2005-10-11

If you want to know what it feels like to live 500 years like Dracula - reading this novel will give you a good idea. While the writing is excellent, the novel is a bit overdone and overlong.  The concept of the story is well thought out and is interesting, but it moves along at a snail's pace. Told mostly through letters from an earlier time, one must wind one's way through several storylines. This is okay - but the documents are not believable as actual letters - particularly letters that sometimes refer to events years in the past. There is too much specific dialog and detail for one to be recounting events that took place almost 20 years earlier. Frustration sets in with some of the detail. At one point one is reading a letter that describes a letter that is being read! Another chapter is devoted to a fictional article from an academic history journal. Some of this could have been summarized for the reader and the focus could have been kept more on the developing plot lines in the novel.  Overall I look forward to the next novel from this author - she is an excellent writer and her knowledge and descriptions of life in eastern Europe are compelling. My wish is that she gets a good editor for her next novel.	2005-10-11

HOwever, I have to agree with other readers, that lately, the female leads are becoming too cold and calculated.  Though NR tried to build their relationship on the notion that they both had trouble getting along with their Mothers, the only real feeling I got from Meg towards Nate was the fact that she felt sorry for him and his sad past and that he looked good.  All in all the story wasn't bad, but there was something lacking in the development of the emotional bond between the two main characters. <br /> <br />The Town of Lunacy was well developed, as were the Alaskan vistas and the trials and tribulations of living in the Great North.   Though, I've never been so far North, I have seen quite a few snow and ice storms and I found NR did a great job describing the realities of dealing with so much snow and cold. <br /> <br />As for the mystery, I found the climax to be rather far fetched.  The unravelling of the mystery was pretty good, though there could've been more foreshadowing to build suspense or anticipation of suspense. <br /> <br />So overall a pretty intetrsting book but not for the reasons why I loved NR in the past (like engaging characters, or dynamic extended family relationships and support systems).	2005-10-11

Jesus didn't sit in a comfortable pew every Sunday. He was 'in the trenches' as Greg Paul and his staff are.<br /><br />This book is a great read. It will get you thinking about what it must be like to live in the 'shadow' city areas. It may motivate you to ask yourself deeper questions as to fate and purpose and God? Why them? Why must this be? Where is God in all of this? How can I help?<br /><br />The personalities described in this book along with their successes and failures, help us understand our common humanity - these were folks who once had dreams and hopes too (and some still do) - despite the fact that reality has faded their aspirations greatly. How could we cope in their place? How can these people still show an indomitable spirit to survive the madness and pain they are exposed to every day?<br /><br />Buy this book. It is raw and real. People of all faiths (those who are open-minded) will find these true stories to be uplifting and encouraging (no candy-coated trite Bible verses).<br /><br />Is it possible to demonstrate the highest of spiritual principles on the street? Greg Paul wrestles to understand the complexity of this question and writes honestly about this issue sharing his experiences, vulnerabilities and insights.	2005-10-11

I chose this novel for a class read for a topic for coming-of-age. Not much to it for sure. Beckett loses her mom, gets her period and experiences some death in her life. <br />Some of the descriptions do not relate to the stories at all. The author tries too hard to make us understand what Beckett is going through. The author uses too much similes to give us vivid description which she is good at. The story itself is not contriguing. It does not seemed to have a acme point(when she figures out that her step mother is not what she thoght to be?) <br />The author tries to give forshadowing points but,she gives so much you know it has something to do with Gothic and Fantasy.  <br />J. Mendelsohn repeats hard with the \\"blood\\".

The authors of Action Coaching  offer forty helpful, easy- to- understand exhibits that: serve as diagnostic tools, offer suggestions on handling difficult situations, provide checklists of to-do's,  feature evaluation and role-playing tools, etc.<br /><br />Wouldn't it be helpful to have a resource where the processes and approach had been successfully field tested in corporations with real executives, with real CEO's who had extremely important strategic challenges ahead of them, and where traditionalist leadership paradigms and behaviors made it impossible to accomplish the articulated goals? That is precisely what these authors did in developing and refining their processes and approaches?<br /><br/>What the Action Coaching is not is a lock-step guide, prescribing every important step and nuance along the way toward helping executive leaders grow. It is a particularly interesting, believable, and seemingly sound approach based on the experiences that they have had with major organizations. The process with individuals and with organizations is one that enables both to help themselves, becoming less dependent upon the external coaches, while building coaching expertise internally.<br /><br />This is the best book of coaching I have ever read, and I've read quite a few.<br /><br />Bill Parker<br /><br />Bill Parker Associates<br /><br />A Leadership Development Resource<br /><br />Richmond, VA<br /><br />PS This is the fourth book I have read by David Dotlich and his colleagues within the past six months. I'd recommend every one of them: Action Learning (1998), Unnatural Leadership (2004), and Leadership Passages (2004). Put together, the series represents a longitudinal action-research case study. Readers of Unnatural Leadership can appreciate the need for the ten new leadership instincts when they remember that they grew from strategic goals and leadership development experiences with corporate clients/partners.	2005-10-11

She makes the assumption that any church that holds to a \\"new move of God\\" is involved with these sexual escapades.  However, should we then assume that Catholic churches that hold to a \\"traditional move of God\\" all support the abuse of children?  Absolutely not!   <br /> <br />Just as a majority of Catholic churches do not have occurences of child abuse, neither do Pentecostal and/or charasmatic churches support this view of sexuality.   <br /> <br />This book sensationalized a few isolated, rare incidences of such a problem and positioned it as the norm for these types of churches.   <br /> <br />I shudder to think of what novel she would write about regarding the Catholic church.	2005-10-11

I am glad I read Undaunted Courage.  The Lewis and Clark Expedition is a major part of our history.  The major criticism I have is that I found the \\"mid section\\", where Ambrose recaps the travel diary Lewis recorded during the expedition, too long.  I did get a feeling for what it was like to be on the journey, but perhaps 150-200 pages instead of 300+ pages would have sufficed.<br /><br />On the other hand, by having to slog through the book, you get a sense of the fatigue they endured, but also the excitement.  I suppose a Montana National Park Ranger or Northwest US aficionado or American Indian buff would savor every detailed description.<br /><br />I was just as interested to learn about the events that lead to the expedition as well as what happened to Lewis and Clark and the Louisiana Territory afterward the expedition.  As an early American history buff, I also enjoyed learning about Jefferson's role.<br /><br />It was interesting to read about American Indian life in the Northwest in the early 1800's before the white men invaded their territory and their interaction with Lewis and Clark.  I enjoyed reading Lewis's description of all the new plants and animals and lands he encountered.<br /><br />All in all, even though it was a little longer than I would have wished, the book was worth it.	2005-10-11

Its imagery is very powerful and well written.  As a ten year old, I began to appreciate taking baths afterwards as David had.  After having children of my own, I re-read the book and found it still to be gripping and so well told that you are drawn into the story and begin to see the world around you from a new perspective.  Now I'm reading it to my children who find it just as enthralling.  It may, however, frighten younger children who are sensitive as it is not a happy tale, but rather one of a lone boys' struggle to survive in a harsh world.  This book, translated from Dutch, is a timeless classic.	2005-10-11

In the ninth book of the series, we get to deal again with the real medieval history of England. The time to deal with King Arthur and Merlin passed in te previous book. Since this is a series, there is further development of all the characters that have been there from the beginning: Brian, Geronde, Carolinus etc. James is also developing and we learn that he is being considered for another promotion in the Magickal arts. All the other favorites also make return appearances even if only very quickly (Aargh and Gorbash). With all of this, it is quite surprising that the Sea Devils and the Gnarlies don't show up!<br /><br />The problem to be resolved this time has to do with keeping King Edward alive. It appears that the evil Lord Cumberland and Agatha Fallon are plotting to kill him and replace him with Cumberland. The chosen means is the Black Plague which is introduced to England by them. Other magical creatures that operate on the evil side are the goblins and we learn quite a bit about the relationship between them and the hobgoblins as well as other denizens of the evil side. A major development occurs with the hobs. It seems that there are thousands of them and in one of the climaxes of this book, there is literally a battle involving them. Quite a difference from how Hob appears in the first books!<br /><br />If you have read the previous titles, this will be more of the same and you will enjoy the developments of the characters. If you have not read any of these before, you will miss most of the fun and should go right back to Dragon and the George!<br /><br />The Fair Maid of Kent makes an appearance and we learn that the 14th century woman could be quite influential in her own way.<br /><br />This is not a small book, yet I devoured it in favor of any other reading over the course of a few days. Well worth it!	2005-10-11

It's highly accessible and covers a lot of territory, more than any other introduction I've encountered. It's only drawback is its superficiality, as it doesn't fully cover probability, mathematical calculus, boolean logic, decision trees, or theorems and proofs..<br /><br />The book begins with the uses of language, fallacies, arguments in ordinary language, Venn Diagrams, and then proceeds to symbolic logic, Aristotlean and a cursory overview of predicate calculus, quantification, science and hypothesis, analogy and probability (especially Mill's four rules of causal inference), and concludes with logic and the law (as a practical example of the application of logic).<br /><br />This book would make an excellent text for an introduction to philosophical logic and arguments. There are definitely superior books that deal with each of the above subjects individually, but none that I know that covers such broad terrain in a short amount of space. As more and more colleges and universities mandate some course in critical thinking, I cannot think of a better text for an introductory overview. If this is the text, take the course.

Because of Leo Carey's wry, admiring, melancholy essay in THE NEW YORKER, I grabbed these novels when I found them at a local used bookstore, and oh, how I wanted to like them more than I ended up doing.  But they're just not as good as the hype.  They drift all over the place [to be fair, Carey admitted that devotees of mysteries would find these books too undisciplined], and the narrator's aggressively amoral personality -- imagine P. G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster crossed with Jonathan Gash's Lovejoy -- can wear on one after a while.  The plots are made of Swiss cheese, at best, and these books are also sadly dated in their views of women.  Maybe it's because I read the Lovejoy books before these -- if I had come to them without knowing about Lovejoy, I would have enjoyed them more.	2005-10-11

I was really looking forward to this book, since I really loved the first on the series (Secrets of a Summer Night -- Annabelle's story). I was intrigued by the love/hate relationship that Marcus and Lillian had going on and their interactions were always funny.<br /><br />In this book, however, there did not seem to be much depth to their relationship. Both are attracted to each other. Early on, in the novel, Marcus acts on an impulse and wildy begins to kiss Lillian. Lillian is completely confused, because she can't believe that the Marcus would want to kiss her. After much thought and discussion with the Wallflowers (her group of friends) Lillian decides that it's because of her perfume -- a special blend that she has created and that the perfumer has told her has a \\"secret ingredient\\". (This leads to one of the more entertaining parts of the book, where each girl takes a bit of the perfume and tries to see it works for all of them -- a running story throughout the book.)<br /><br />My favorite parts of the book involved the four Wallflowers (Annabel, Lillian, Evie, and Daisy.) Their interactions were fun and very natural -- like good friends getting together.<br /><br />The actual romance, between Marcus and Lillian, was not as interesting. It seemed very -- well, frankly, formulaic.<br /><br />Marcus was raised by a horrible father who taught him not love anything -- Lillian was a crass American who didn't want to learn manners. When it came down to it, nothing was really standing in the way of them getting together -- just their own perceptions of each other. No other issues to really get through.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this book to those who have read the first book in the series and for those who read Kleypas, no matter what. However, for a general reader, I would say, \\"don't start with this one.\\" The book I'm really looking forard to is the next one \\"Devil in Winter\\" because Lord. St. Vincent/Evie seem much more interesting that Marcus/Lillian.that Marcus/Lillian.	2005-10-11

Through the first campaign in California to the second term in the White House,  Deaver advanced from campaign staffer to the office adjacent to the Oval Office.<br /><br />Deaver introduces the reader to the private Reagan.  We see Reagan as he lives with Nancy, works with his staff and deals with his adversaries.  Deaver portrays Reagan as knowing his core values and adhering to them.  Even in controversy, such as the Bitburg decision, Reagan's loyalty to his friends remained unshaken.<br /><br />A self identified member of the family, Deaver provides an insight into Nancy's role in protecting and leading Reagan through his life.<br /><br />In the story of his own return to the Reagans after Deaver's downfall, Deaver presents a loyal, concerned Reagan, unlike some others who portray Reagan as dumping cohorts who are no longer useful to him.  Finally, through Michael Deaver, we see the declining Reagan in the early stages of Alzheimer's.<br /><br />\\"A Different Drummer\\" is a sympathetic portrayal of a confident, steady leader by one of his closest associates.  It is a valuable tool with which to uncover the real Ronald Reagan.	2005-10-11

Barron created a sweeping fantasy classic in the \\"Lost Years of Merlin\\" series. Now he follows up with a brand new series, taking place eight hundred years after the creation of Avalon -- \\"The Great Tree of Avalon: Child of the Dark Prophecy,\\" full of magic, chills and humor.<br /><br />As the book opens, legendary wizard Merlin rescues an orphaned eagleboy from a pair of mercenaries, and gives him to a flamelon woman with a half-human baby. He also leaves his staff with the eagleboy. The boys are raised together, but are separated when a pack of evil creatures try to kill them. Now Tamwyn is on the hunt for his brother Scree, but is haunted by questions about his own past. There's a prophecy that that year, both Merlin's true heir (and grandson) and the Dark Child of a sinister prophecy will come of age that year.<br /><br />Elsewhere, a young priestess named Elli is accompanying her snobby superior to a meeting with the Lady of the Lake. They end up meeting with Tamwyn, who is beginning to believe that Scree is Merlin's heir -- and that he himself is the Dark Child. But an evil sorcerer is threatening all of Avalon, disrupting the magical waters that sustain it -- and Tamwyn, Elli and Scree may be the only ones who can save their homeland.<br /><br />It's hard to take the story almost a millennium forward, with an almost entirely new cast and new problems. But \\"Child of the Dark Prophecy\\" has a certain familiarity, since Barron explores themes of good, the potential for evil, doubt, power and love -- just as he did in the \\"Merlin\\" series.<br /><br />One thing that hasn't changed is that Barron's writing is vibrant and lush, without getting bogged down in the details. Not to mention his healthy doses of humor, such as the snotty priestess's face being turned green by her facial. There are strange creatures, ranging from little shapeshifting imps to giant mud-dwellers.<br /><br />The one flaw may be the villain; his motives are excellent, but they aren't even hinted at until the final showdown. But, for clarity's sake, Barron also includes a detailed timeline that explains the events of the past eight hundred years, including the marriage of Merlin and deerwoman Hallia, and the war that precedes this conflict. This is very helpful, although don't read it until the book is over.<br /><br />Familiar faces pop up here and there. Merlin himself appears for only a short time; the Lady of the Lake turns out to be an old friend, and half-deaf Shim shows up again (tiny once more). A familiar evil character also returns late in the book. But the book belongs to Tamwyn, nervous about his possible destiny and his growing magical powers, and fiery Elli, with her haunted past. Though initially they despise each other, their friendship starts to grow. Eagleboy Scree doesn't get as much attention -- he spends most of the book in a cave -- but he's an excellent character when he reencounters his brother.<br /><br />Beautifully written and full of thrills, \\"Child of the Dark Prophecy\\" is a worthy follow-up to the \\"Lost Years of Merlin\\" series, yet will leave readers longing for the next book in the series.

Without giving too much away, I found the parallell abduction plots artfully constructed, and the plucky heroine of Lady Helen particularly delightful. Sammy the goat, a magic frying pan, and an ever hungry Baron round out the cast nicely. Young readers will find humor spiced with just the right amount of suspense in the adventures of Helen and her would-be rescuers amongst the Witchaliks.	2005-10-11

But the guy she is going to bed is a complete slob and I can't see a female of any species taking to him.  Rem Q'an Tal is having problems due to his lack of a sacred mate-he is starting to devolve mentally and physically and he saves Giselle from the slob.  There is some well written erotica in this book with good characters, but there are some plot elements that are plain silly.  Now this is fantasy so realism should not be expected; but the idea of oral se4x as a form of payment is silly enough to disturb the willful suspension of disbelief.  Overall I find the book a little below average for the genre.  The attack by a devolved mental case is OK but not as well written as I would expect from this author and his disposal (he decides Giselle is the goddess because of her freckles and commits suicide) is weak overall.	2005-10-11

This is one of the most comprehensive books on project management that I have found.  It summarizes many of the experiences that I have encountered in software development and, in addition, adds some very good insights into subjects that have historically been problem areas for me. <br /> <br />Joe's description of software engineering thought processes are spot on, and will help anyone who needs to work closely with software engineers.  His discussion of historic projects that ended in tragedy show that the problems that haunt large projects are not limited to software projects. <br /> <br />His section (Part 3 The Project-Management View) on project management is a must read for any person who has a project management role.  The classic problem of tradeoffs, estimation and scheduling are analyzed and explained in a very useful manner.  For some of the more `touchy-feely' subjects, Joe introduces Roscoe Leroy, an imaginary character, who spouts a continuous stream of common sense and real world wisdom. <br /> <br />This book is a good read for anyone in the software industry.  The subject matter discussed in the book will help communication among all the different levels and roles in the software industry. <br />	2005-10-11

An exceptional book dealing with exceptionally important qustions: Where was God?  Why did God allow this to happen?  What is the Will of God? And, ultimately, if God is in control, and if He is a God of Love, why does He let bad things happen?  What kind of God could let these things happen?  This book not only addresses but answers those eternal questions.  Weatherhead makes sense of the seemingly senseless.  <br /> <br />Written in World War II, another time in which God's will was being brought into question, an example used in the book is somewhat dated in its attitude toward women, but one example set in a specific time period,should not detract from the book's oveall thrust: The Will of God in our lives.

Obvious tie-ins are hoped for, but I haven't read that bestseller; I was referred to Third Secret via Amazon and enjoyed it as a relative rarity, a theological thriller.<br /><br />You have to love any book that contains these lines: a key figure \\"produced a small black controller. 'One press and Swiss guards charge into this room. Assaulting the pope is a serious crime.'\\" (308) And admire, whatever prose or creed you incline towards, this description of a skeptical witness of a visionary: \\"For an instant he thought he caught a glimmer of light in her pupils--two quick flashes of a reflected image--a swirl of blue and gold. His head whirled left, searching for the source, but there was nothing. Only the sunlit corner and the silent statue. Whatever was occuring was apparently [the visionary's] alone.\\" (237. No plot spoilers, thus the brackets.)<br /><br />Not up to the apocalyptic shocks of GK Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday--which I highly recommend to any reader of Berry--but a quick-paced, if rather too fast-moving, reimagining of Marian visions, not only of Fatima but relating to common trends also seen at LaSalette, Lourdes, and Medjugorje. (Garabandal and other discredited ones would have been clever to throw in as contrasts with those to which the Church has deemed \\"worthy of assent.\\" And Berry's legal eye works well here to analyze the implications of this at first supportive phrase from Rome, which leads into the heart of the tension in this story. I am glad I did not read many of the earlier posted reviews here, as they give away far too much of the plot. The chapters, I agree with other critics, are often too telegraphic, and with 71 of them I felt as if I was reading merely Berry's expanded outline too often.<br /><br />For me, not wanting to diminish the suspense denoted in the novel's subtitle, suffice to say I found it a notch above the \\"airport reading\\" I expected. Berry has done a commendable job in relating serious theological debate on issues of the utmost importance to Catholicism and incorporates a lot of expository byways that prove also intriguing. Why prelates wear skullcaps, what is addressed to a dead pope three times, how St. Malachy's alleged prophecies might mesh with the German pope neatly elected after this novel's publication and its fictional Teutonic pontiff, and the clash of humanism and authority within such structures as the former Irish homes for unwed mothers and today's celibate mandate for (unless you transfer from the Anglican priesthood as already married!) Latin rite priests and clergy makes for often thoughtful as well as enlightening engagement well above a genre-bound page-turner. A brief afterward documents Berry's research and his alterations.<br /><br />The strengths I found most emanated from Michener's struggle with his vocation, although why he entered the priesthood seems a mystery. A stronger connection with his Irish past remained  necessary; the links Berry crafts here feel too flimsy. The fey clerical henchmen defies credibility--although even he does surprise me a bit, credit to the author I admit. (I was half-expecting him--and his episcopal manipulator--to be part of that dependable Dan Brown scapegoat Opus Dei, so heavy-handed was the sidekick's character and the clumsiness with which he--and again his employer--was drawn by the author.)<br /><br />If you decide to take the plunge, stick with the middle portion--what's predictable does swerve again into more satisfying speculation despite the utter unreality of what a pope would be most concerned with immediately upon election to the throne, and all the jet flights across Europe, however quickly accomplished, blur crucial periods of the action into unbelievably action-driven scenes involving cardinals as well as connivers. That such high-ranking figures would be skulduggerers amidst the pomp of a papal investiture never convinced me at all.<br /><br />I don't care how much \\"the fate of the Church\\" depends on the third secret--it remained preposterous that its highest figures would be dashing about Eastern Europe while a pope died and another lurked to grab St. Peter's chair. (Speaking of which, I suspect Berry muddles papal infallibility--which has to be \\"from the chair,\\" or ex cathedra explicitly stated, not, as he proposes, in any matter even of faith or morals, unless I am wrong. Viz. \\"Cathedra\\" in the Oxford Dict. of the Christian Church: \\"No authoritative statement exists as to which particular Papal pronouncements are 'ex cathedra'.\\")<br /><br />The love interests occupy a respectable portion of the plot and prepare the reader for wider relevance as the climax approaches. I was moved by the final portions of this novel, and only wish that they could be fulfilled, personally and for the Church. If the ending strikes other Amazonians as preposterous, consider that as I read this novel, cardinals were gathered at the Vatican to gingerly hint at possible liberalization of celibacy for priests, as an Eastern rite Melkite priest argued to his Latin rite confreres.<br /><br />Berry, astutely, has a relevant subject: a German pope, this ever-deepening conflict within the priesthood as vocations decline and congregations in the Third World increase, and the vexing tug-of-war between clerical and lay factions as to married clergy, reproductive freedom, gay unions, and the expression of sexuality.

Although there are some biographical briefs in both English and Italian, there is no other record that speaks of where he stood on the issues of his day. For here, is the valiant champion of human dignity for women, bastards, the handicapped, the remarried, homosexuals, and others whose everyday lives are scorned by doctrine. I have one reservation: the title \\"Murder in the Vatican\\" should be subordinated or dropped. Also, the front cover is not representative of the contents of the book. This is not a comic book. It is an important book, one of the more important books of our time. Although the author's investigation into the Pope's unwitnessed death is interesting and revealing, he should not allow the mysterious circumstances of this good man's death to overpower the great contributions of his life.

When ordinary people think of Marines, they think of the presidential speeches with Marines standing at attention in the background. We always see Marines as detached from our reality of paying bills and taking kids to school. We angst over trivial and insignificant pains that impede our everyday lives. We believe that we make difficult decisions every day. After reading \\"One Bullet Away\\" it is impossible to imagine a young man in his early twenties making such difficult decisions, with so much weight on his shoulders. A Marine carries a load that is not in his military issue backpack. Marines carry the weight of other Marine's lives, to teach them, to train them, and inevitably to lead them, possibly to their deaths. It is a weight that most can never fathom. This is a young man's journey from OCS to Afghanistan to Iraq, and the unimaginable weight on his shoulders as he leads his Marines into an arena that few men have ever faced.  <br />      Nate will take you through his first thoughts in joining the United States Marine Corps. You will ride shot gun as OCS unfolds, sharing his pain as he sweats it out. Once OCS has ended you will begin to understand it was the 20 something's only safe time for the next several years. He will take you to a small ship where he and his men learn of September 11th. He will show you what it means to be the tip of the spear in Afghanistan. Nate will then put you in front seat of a humvee with no armor, and no windows, full of bullet holes down the streets of hostile towns in Iraq on their mad dash to Baghdad. You will feel the rush of emotion when you ask yourself if you could make the decisions that needed to be made with little or no information.  <br />     You will shed a tear when you finish the book and realize that young men like Nate will never have a peaceful rest for as long as they live...........for us. <br />This book is a wonderful read and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br />Semper FI	2005-10-11

There really was no good excuse for action up to the last minute, as this book very ably shows, but that's what happened, and it's a story that doesn't always get told. I do agree with the conclusion of the author: the only consequence of the Great War was that it led directly to World War II. Read this book, and you will once again be astounded by the utter stupidity of the way-behind-the -front -lines generals and their staffs.	2005-10-11

This innovative to poverty will create opportunities for the poor by offering them choices and encouraging self-esteem.<br /><br />Illustrating his message with a wealth of case studies, Prahalad demonstrates how this can be done profitably by:<br /><br />* Challenging your assumptions about bottom of the pyramid markets.<br /><br />* Unlocking what he calls the \\"poverty penalty.\\"<br /><br />* Delivering dignity, enablement and choice rather than just products.<br /><br /> The author argues persuasively that with the private sector leading this change will result in real strides in job creation and services for the poor rather than rhetorical flourishes.	2005-10-11

But in the eighth volume of Rumiko Takahashi's \\"Ranma 1/2,\\" things get even worse for the teenage martial artist -- he now has three fiancees and a newly-cursed rival to deal with.<br /><br />A mysterious young man, Ukyo, thrashes Ranma's dad and threatens to do the same to Ranma. Ukyo is a childhood pal of Ranma's, now a master okonomiyaki chef (sort of between a pancake and a pizza). But he seems angry at Ranma, for reasons Ranma doesn't understand and soon challenges him to a duel. It ends with Ranma and Akane discovering a shocking connection to Ukyo: \\"He\\" is really a girl, and Ranma's fiance....<br /><br />As if this weren't uncomfortable enough for Ranma, Ryoga soon arrives and tries to throttle Ranma for having another fiancee when he also has Akane. Ukyo clues in that Ryoga likes Akane; to get Ranma all for herself, she sets up a date between the bashful Ryoga and clueless Akane. Problem is, Ranma soon shows up as Ryoga's \\"long lost fiancee...\\"<br /><br />There's no fun in the sun for the Ranma gang, when Ranma sets ancient martial-artists Cologne and Happosai on a date.  Turns out Happosai raided the Amazon village a hundred years ago, and stole a valuable heirloom... which has three love pills embedded in it. And now Akane has accidently swallowed the \\"life\\" one. And finally, a trip to the circus reunites the gang with Mousse, who now has a Jusenkyo curse of his own... and a new grudge against Ranma.<br /><br />Ranma doesn't even need to turn into a girl to have romantic complications -- he has enough of them just as a boy. The eighth volume tallies his fiancee count up to three, with poor Ranma not responsible for any of the engagements.<br /><br />There's plenty of goofy humour in this one, everything from legally blind Mousse kidnapping a stuffed pig to Ryoga almost making out with the disguised Ranma. But it ends on a taut cliffhanger, with Mousse about to turn the captive Akane into a duck, so he can trap Ranma. Somebody get that boy a therapist.<br /><br />This volume also introduces Ukyo Kuonji, a girl who has been living as a boy for ten years. Ukyo is also Akane's biggest rival: Not only does she have a longer acquaintance with Ranma, but she's also tough, blunt, pretty, a good cook, and far wilier than the brutally ditzy Shampoo. And poor Ryoga gets his feelings played with once again.<br /><br />One of Rumiko Takahashi's most memorable characters makes her debut in the eighth volume of \\"Ranma 1/2,\\" bringing even more romantic turmoil in her wake.

Now, if you are intrested in the politics and culture, as well as the present, past and future reguarding the population and child bearing policy as well as domestic and international adoption; the book could be a good resourse.

Here is a family with 10 kids, the father is an alcoholic, the family is always living on the edge, and the mother is forced to get by writing jingles for contests.  It's quite possible to imagine that life with this group was a mixture of good and bad, and that it wasn't all awful.  But, its hard to imagine that it was just so relentlessly great.<br /><br />This book has the feel of a children's book.

I have friends who rave about what a magical place it is.  And while I admit, that first look upon exiting the train station is like nothing you've ever seen....   I just can't get there.  Venice is so crowded with tourists and people selling dancing Mickey and Minnies on the famous bridges, and crowds of inappropriately dressed folks off the cruise ships.  The first time I heard the orchestras in St. Marks Square start up, it was the theme from Bonanza they played; not Vivaldi. <br /> <br />But now that I've read The City of Falling Angels I am anxious to go back!  I want to explore the hidden backways I've read about.  I want to read Ezra Pound and see a performance in La Fenice (at the very least, I want to take a tour of the refurbished Teatro).  I want to see the glassmakers on Murano with new eyes.  And I want to stay in Cannaregio and get up early to watch the world come awake.   <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this book.

Books	1	25	91	N	N	A Sad commentary on how to brainwash your child before he gains a mind of his own	I found this book truly sad but no surprise at this time in our history. It seems so many people of this nature feel they are so threatened by their close minded politics and their conservative religious hate-mongering.  One really has to wonder about the ethics of parents who want to brainwash their children before they have the opportunity to make their own minds.  I also found it very sad to hear conservative parents here stating just that. <br />  Is hate such a needed part of their existence?  One has to wonder about the counseling their children are going to need long after their parents are gone to undo all of the brainwashing their parents practiced.  This book deserves nothing more than the deserved disgust and ugliness that it is.  If americans can act no better than this, is it any wonder that some causes just as hateful and beligerant as they are wish to send suicide bombers amongst us?  Hate breeds hate, and brainwashing is disgusting and cowardly no matter how you phrase it.  It is a sad state of affairs in this country when hate mongering literature of this nature is published openly and not in the dark shadows and alley ways where it has always been before this great country hid their heads in the sand and decided their opinion, no matter how narrow minded and hate filled, is the only right view one should take in this country.  Just what we need, another peice of trash passed off as literature for our children.  If there ever was a book that public libraries should ban, it is this one.  I give this book less than a quarter star, only because the author must know how to read and is not totally ignorant.  As to value other than proving the author can read and write, it has no value, and is just another rubbish can filler.  Oh, it makes great paper to kine your birdcage with as well.	2005-10-11

The first work of his I read was his last (unless, like the late Ludlum, his estate decides to keep him alive through badly written and truly \\"ghost\\" novels).<br /><br />  McBain wrote, I think, 55 87th Precinct police procedurals. \\"The Big Bad City\\" was published in 1999. Structurally, McBain seems to have found a forumula and stuck with it - and that's a good thing, because his forumula works.<br /><br />  In a city that stands in as a thinly veiled New York city, the 87th Precinct bustles with activity. The precinct's detectives juggle many cases at a time, some propelled by political pressure, others by the personal involvement of the detectives, some because of happenstance and lucky tips or breaks.<br /><br />  In \\"The Big Bad City,\\" a burglar dubbed The Cookie Boy by the press because he leaves chocolate cookies behind is on the loose;  the man who killed Detective Cardella's father decides to wrap up loose ends by killing the Detective is on the prowl and a woman is found strangled in the park. The latter case rises from the routine when the woman is discovered to be a young nun - with breast implants.<br /><br />  McBain is in flawless. His characters have enough depth to be believable; just enough depth. His police officers run the range from the competent to slovenly and not quite-as-competent. Some are fair-minded, some are bigots. They solve their crimes through good, tedious police work. They don't get miraculous breaks: just those that they develop through their own persistence , diligence, experience and hard-work, aided by the occasional walk-in or phone-in tip. McBain is terrific at describing this often boring, often discouraging work without himself becoming tedious.<br /><br />  The unravelling of the murder of the nun is great storytelling as is the story of the guy plotting to kill the cop. The burglar story is a delight that could easily stand alone as a short story.<br /><br />  I regret having discovred McBain after his death, but he left one hell of a legacy.<br /><br />Jerryiscovred McBain after his death, but he left one hell of a legacy. <br /> <br />Jerry	2005-10-11

Let me be clear I am not one of the men in her book but better a stranger that met her on a flight from NY to Chicago. She stated that she had just authored a book so wanting to support her I told her I would pick it up and read it. In fact weeks later she personally delivered the book to my job.  <br /> <br />The book was a Bold step by Ms. Meyeil to show all of her character Modesty's sides both fiction and non-fiction. I must admit after conversing with Ms. Meyeil I did not realize how powerful the book would be or as explicit but I like it raw, real and uncut. The character Modesty lived so many lifetimes that at the end I was happy for her but also exhausted. That to me is when the author has written a good piece of work because you feel like you have lived through character. Let's not forget so many in Modesty's shoes end up dead, on drugs or in jail and she definitely came close with all these. Her home life (father in jail, distant relationship with her mother and the relationship with her first love) could and would drive anyone crazy and at time that insanity showed. But so did Modesty's strength.  <br /> <br />The hardest or most difficult part of the book is when she described Modesty's being raped that was a little too painful to me and I found myself anger while reading. <br /> <br />I would definitely recommend this book to everyone who is an adult because this is not a children's book and I look forward to Ms. Meyeil's next literary works as well as our continued friendship <br />	2005-10-11

Every supply chain is unique, and there are many areas of operations that are affected by the supply chain and conversely those same areas affect the supply chain's performance. This book by no means solves all supply chain problems, but it does identify a number of areas that have an actual or potential impact on the performance of the supply chain. <br />              Since the supply chain is so critical to any commercial activity any assistance that can be provided will enable the supply chain manager to improve his supply chain/s performance, albeit incrementally.                            <br />              The best service this book provides is the identification of those areas that impact the supply chain. Many supply chain managers may be so focussed on a limited number of areas and overlook some other important areas that impact the supply chain. <br />             Potential solutions to a number of supply chain problems are presented, and these solutions are scientifically based. In other words they have been tested out in empirical, real world situations. So the advice that one can take from these solutions is sound and not just based on someone's opinion.	2005-10-11

However, this book just couldn't hold my attention.  I am a history major, and I taught history, but I couldn't get past all the historical ramblings and the blah, blah, blah about ancient Egypt.  I didn't, or couldn't, relate to any of the characters and the situations they found themselves.

If you are interested in learning why things are the way they are today, just look into history, right? Right.

The stories of our collective lives as humans on this planet.<br /><br />If you're not convinced that you should read this book, check out the Joseph Campbell foundation online to learn more about the master.<br /><br />This particular book is entirely based on a conversation between Bill Moyers and Joseph Campbell. You can get the DVD from Amazon.com. I recommend this for anyone that can't absorb a lot of information from written words. I have to read and reread each page before it sinks in. Get the DVD. If you can afford either, go get a used version of the book.<br /><br />You won't be sorry. This is an amazing book!	2005-10-11

Dr. Barbara Jean Fairmont, \\"BJ\\" to her friends, seems to have it all, a successful medical practice, a loving family and devoted friends. The only thing missing is the baby that she desperately yearns for. When Colonel Flynn MacIntire, her old high school flame, comes back to town in need of physical therapy for a leg injury, BJ doesn't hesitate to jump in and help him.  <br /> <br />Flynn unintentionally finds an adoption agency letter in BJ's kitchen and comes up with the idea of a marriage of convenience. BJ could not have been more shocked at his unbelievable proposal but he persists, explaining that if she were married the likelihood of her adopting might increase and and in the meantime she can work with him in getting his leg back in shape so he can return to active duty. <br /> <br />The entire town of Whistler's Bend, Montana loves and relies upon \\"Doc\\" BJ, and once Flynn returns, he too is thrown right into the mix. Characters from the first book in this series, A Fabulous Wife, revisit with the same charm and wit as before. When you add two adorable brothers whose little lives also depend heavily on BJ and eventually Flynn, and who are in turn needed just as much themselves, you have a truly satisfying love story, one that encompasses the adults as well as the children. <br /> <br />This book contains a heartwarming story of friendship and love, and will stay in your thoughts for some time after you've finished reading. I enjoyed it very much and look forward to A Fabulous Wedding, although I will regret the close of this wonderful series by Dianne Castell. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

This would satiate a beginning reader, but for thirty dollars an hour and fifteen minutes of story seems to me a ripoff. It could have been condensed into one book and made a lot cheaper that way.  I also don't quite agree with the previous reviewer that an adult would love this. The plot is completely childish, and it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. There is (or was, it may have been canceled) a movie scheduled to come out in 2006 on the Spiderwick chronicles, and if they can make a one and a half hour movie out of it I'd be amazed. I understand that the authors were writing this story for kids, but it would have done a lot better if they had written it for adults because it didn't have the quality that a normal, flopping science fiction/ fantasy book has. It's not too long (it's actually too short), and easy to explain. Which brings me back to another point, why didn't the authors explain the story just a little more? Kids would still have understood the story while adults (and even teens) would enjoy it more.	2005-10-11

Baby food begins to loose vitamins after a month in the  <br />freezer.  <br /> <br />Another example is that is recommends the one cooks the fruits and vegetables for 10-30 min. This completely depletes the vitamins of the food. What is the point of making the baby food then??? <br /> <br />It suggests introduction of certain vegetables and fruits that are considered highly allergenic at an early age/month. This only increases the risk of allergies for your baby. <br /> <br />It never warns parents of nitrates in carrots, beets, turnips etc. So any person reading this book would feed a 5 or 6 months old carrots cooked at home and would be feeding her baby nitrates. Current research shows that babies can only process nitrates at 8 months or older. <br /> <br />This books needs some serious updating! <br /> <br />A much better book is Mommy Made and Daddy Too!

Even so, they always wound up back in the famous fairyland at some point. This volume doesn't even do that. Oz appears only at the periphery. <br /> <br />The story brings back some of Thompson's characters from a previous volume. Captain Salt has been designated as the royal explorer of Oz and he stops of to pick up King Ato of the Octagon Isle to serve as his cook as he goes off exploring. Roger the Read Bird also has to come along to keep things stirred up. The crew sets off on a voyage of discovery and, of course, adventure. Oz only appears as the imperial power claiming the new lands. <br /> <br />Early on, the explorers pick up a young prince being held captive by savages and his guardian hippo. The young prince turns out to be the king of another fairyland on a legendary continent and the crew sets out to restore him against the wishes of the usurpers. <br /> <br />Thompson usually does well with her own characters as opposed to using Baum's. That is marginally the case with this book as well but it does not read as well as most of her others. It is a fair story but nothing to get overly excited about. <br />	2005-10-11

I truly loved this book, as it was a throwback to so many novels of old. Today authors feel they have to go on for 500+ pages and at the end you have no true feelings for the characters of the book. But, in a mere 260 pages Diamant has provided us with many, many characters who are basically set forth in their own chapter of the book and you feel the need to keep constantly turning pages to see how the affairs of Dogtown turned out. <br /> <br />    Diamant starts us out with a question from one of her main characters, Judy Rhines, a question as to why there was so little blood on a suicide victim, and from there introduces us to the main characters of the book in the very first chapter. Thereafter it is a story of those characters that compel us to keep on reading as she intertwines both the current state of that individual with stories of the past that help fill in some of the blanks that are in Dogtown.  <br /> <br />     It is not until almost at the very end that Judy finds out why there was so little blood, and this revelation came as a complete shock to me. For some reason I never saw it coming, nor did Diamant ever really dwell on that issue again for over 250 pages. Instead she kept us going with stories of so-called witches (Easter Carter) and evil relatives (Tammy Younger and Mrs. Stanley). From the few blacks who inhabited Dogtown we saw how that even in the so-called free North there truly was a stigma upon being black, with the local minister not wanting to preside at a funeral of the last black inhabitant of Dogtownuntil subtly coerced by Judy Rhines. <br /> <br />    This book has brought forth characters that I will remember for a long time such as Easter Carter, Judy Rhines, Oliver Younger, John Woodsman a/k/a Black Ruth and many more. One of the more memorable chapters for me was a short passage about a local dog called Greyling. While not a total outcast in Dogtown, Greyling was not born to the town and never ascended to the top of the dog world, which was OK with him. He had his place and he knew it and liked it. Makes one think of our own towns and how difficult it is for newcomers to become part of a community. <br /> <br />    In the end, this is just a lovely book that could have been any town in the US. It is a story that could be repeated in Boom Towns gone dry, Gold Rush villages, on little towns that just happened to be on the outskirts of a larger town, etc. It is a story of both the death of a town, as well as a story about those who \\"escaped\\" and made better lives for themselves. It is a story that will stay with me forever. <br /> <br /> <br />Blaine DeSantis	2005-10-11

But even more stuff that does not yet find its way into my own workflows, because a)I do not understand everything or b) I have difficulties to judge when a method is appropriate for my specific needs.  <br /> <br />This book should not be read as a stand-alone guide. The Professional Photoshop by the same author is the bigger framework to start with.  In the introductions of these two books the author gives you the best hint which chapter you should take onboard first and which you can/should leave for future studies.  <br /> <br />It is also worth looking at the time aspect, i.e. how much time do you have available for working on each image. The author has addressed this issue in a very straightforward way in the LAB book. I think this will make any reader review her/his workflows. First time I have seen anything like this in a book about digital imaging.  <br /> <br />Also the practical advice that improvements you cannot recognize with your eyes are not worth doing. By that you can leave all theoretical speculations on data loss (color space transformations, 8 or 16 b etc) for those who really can recognize and appreciate the difference. <br /> <br />This book can really be recommended for people serious about their digital imaging. But to get it right you have to know about the big picture first. So if you are not a professional start with Professional Photoshop. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

This is in regards to the audio (CD) version read by Tim Curry:<br /><br />The story is a psychological drama pitting an evil adult against 3 seemingly helpless children.  As such, it relies heavily on nuance and character interaction to advance the story-line.  Action plays a very small role in this story.  Consequently it requires the listener to pay relatively close attention.<br /><br />I mention this because I listened to this with my two 7 year olds and a my 10 year old.  The 10 year old was enthralled but the 7 year olds didn't quite grasp it fully and were, as a result, less enthused.  Though the CD will make a valuable addition to your child's library, be aware that he/she will have to have achieved a certain level of maturity before it will be fully appreciated.<br /><br />As for me, I found it very entertaining and was pleased that it was not a run of the mill good versus evil story with a pat ending.  And Tim Curry did an outstanding job bringing life to the characters - of special note is the constantly coughing Poe.<br /><br />The only downside - At the end of the CD is an \\"interview\\" with the author that I was unable to get through.  He posed as Snicket's press man and would answer questions about Snicket as posed to him by a reporter.  A bit ridiculous and offering little insight.	2005-10-11

While not the book I think it could have been, &lt;u>Icons of Evolution&lt;/u> represents a unique and invaluable contribution to the continuing controversy over how we teach origins science. First and foremost, Wells does us a service in his very framing of the issue: whereas much of this debate is centered around what people think we ought to be teaching children when it comes to origins science, Wells really is the only credentialled scientist I know of to produce a popular work focused instead on what it is that we are teaching them. We would do well to treat Wells's work as the beginning, and not the end, of that discussion. <br /> <br />Given the aforementioned focus, the central theme of &lt;u>Icons&lt;/u> is that much of what our children are taught regarding biological origins is in the form of iconography - vivid and memorable visual representations of \\"epic moments\\" in the overarching narrative of evolutionary history. Wells's contention is that much of this iconography is misleading (and occasionally even fraudulent); in fact, eleven of the twelve chapters in &lt;u>Icons&lt;/u> deal with a specific one of these representations. In each case, Wells compares the scientific literature in the specialty area pertaining to each icon with the textbook presentation thereof, and in each case, he finds significant misrepresentations, overstatements, and simplifications that do not do justice to the enterprise of science. Further, the pattern common to all of these missteps in the textbook presentations is that they all simplify in the direction of making Darwinian theory appear more plausible, more certain - perhaps more scientific - than the evidence itself can really suggest. <br /> <br />Wells's book is meticulously researched, and provides a good deal of fascinating backround information on the areas of research represented by each \\"icon.\\" I would have given this work five stars for the depth of its research and its value in framing future discussions on Darwinism in education. However, I for one could have used with a sharper focus and a less polemic tone in places, and - while amusing - I think the \\"Warning Stickers\\" Wells included at the back of the book serve to reduce its critical acceptance. It is true in my experience that the Darwinian camp tends to behave in an unjustifiably hostile manner towards its critics; nevertheless, it seems that if serious criticisms of Darwinism are ever to gain widespread traction, they will need to elevate research over advocacy both in content and in tone. In my opinion, Wells could have done a better job of this in the \\"tone\\" department by cutting short some of the anti-Darwinian rhetoric I find in this work. Nevertheless, I know of no alternative book that surveys this issue as comprehensively as does Wells, so while it may not quite be the book I think it could have been, it certainly surpasses any other book that is on the subject, and on that basis I highly recommend purchasing and digesting it. <br /> <br />(I should also mention that unfortunately, my copy -- from the first paperback edition, printed in 2002 -- bears a number of typographical and printing errors, including some apparently missing text between pages in the chapter on the Miller-Urey experiment. I hope these have been corrected in subsequent editions.)	2005-10-11

Worth was totally blown away by the things Fox did that day; he didn't just play the organ (from memory, which was unheard of in the organ world), he mastered the organ. Is there a word beyond \\"virtuoso\\"? That is how good Fox was on the organ. After years of practice, Worth became one of the Fox \\"group\\" and became an organist on his own. <br /> <br />During the 1950s and 1960s, Fox was the organist at the Riverside Church in New York City. His gay lover, Richard Weagly, was the Choir Director. The unpleasant end to their relationship was played out in front of everyone. Fox spent a lot of time on tour, playing in churches and concert halls all over America. After each concert, Fox loved spending hours greeting everyone who stood in line to chat or get an autograph. He was a natural showman who wanted people to know who he was, and demanded to be able to be seen by the audience. <br /> <br />It was also the era of pipe organs (before electronics) where each pipe had to be tuned individually. Fox was extremely picky about the sound of whatever organ he was playing, frequently driving organ tuners nuts. In the late 1960s, Fox was asked to resign from the Riverside Church; he had gotten \\"too big\\" for the Church. <br /> <br />This book chronicles many ups and downs in Fox's life, both personal and professional. To replace Richard, his lover, Fox brought home a much younger man named David. He was not well liked by the people around Fox, including his manager, and David did little to endear himself to the group. In the late 1970s, Fox entered the hospital for a prostate operation. He was told that the whole tumor was removed, and everything was fine. Fox did nothing about it for a year, only to be told that just half the tumor was removed, and the cancer had spread. He died in October 1980. <br /> <br />This is an excellent, but specialized, book. Anyone who is interested in organ music, or the life of Virgil Fox, should read this book. For everyone else, Fox was a person who enjoyed life to the fullest, and it shows here. It is very much recommended. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

This book was, cover to cover, packed with new anecdotes and stories with which I was unfamiliar.  Bramwell's accounts are warm and frank.  This book is also, after years of indecision, and along with Pete Shotton's, the book that finally convinced me that Yoko Ono was not only the disruptive force that split the Beatles but also an out and out evil woman.  I loved every page of this book and read it slowly to savor the experience.	2005-10-11

Finally, the myth promoted by John Cornwell, a disgruntled liberal (\\"free-thinking\\") Catholic, is overwhelmingly put to rest by a Jewish writer who--unlike Cornwell--is clearly unbiased. Rabbi Dalin has worked hard to ensure that the true facts about his people's suffering during the Holocaust are preserved, and he has little patience for those who would like to distort these facts for their own political gains. He has done a great service for the Catholic Church and all traditional religion--which is regularly mocked, belittled, and vilified by the liberal media--and for this I thank him from the bottom of my heart.	2005-10-11

If you ever wanted to know the conservative (or classic liberal) point of view on the topics of the day (social security, welfare, minimum wage, etc.), but did not feel like trudging through \\"The Wealth of Nations\\", this is the book for you.  Whether you agree or disagree with the arguments, they are proposed in easily accessible language. <br /> <br />I think that the most important chapter is the one which gave the history of bank runs and the creation of the Federal Reserve.  I knew about what the Fed did/did not do up until the crash, but did not know about all of the prior bank runs.  If you do not know this history, learn about it here or from other sources because it will change the way you view the Fed and their ability to manipulate the economy. <br /> <br />This book is dated so be forewarned.  However, the overall approach of synthesizing policy, thesis and antithesis is a fantastic.  For those without any background in this area, it will be an \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" kind of reading.	2005-10-11

This is a most unique book in many ways.

Little Doom is a tiny village of 15 people in Cornwall, England.

This being the case, it it important that somebody pull together the threads of the legends and weave a representative Arthurian robe for us to wear. Alright, that's probably enough metaphor for one day, but the point I'm making is that I think White has done far and away the best job of making the legends into a single legend, making each of the key figures, Merlin, Lancelot, Guinevere, Mordred, and of course Arthur become the Anglo-Saxon gods who dwelled with mortals. The prose is powerful, the stories never bore, and even though we know the somewhat open-ended non-ending, we are still inspired and the better for having fought the battles. If you enjoy Sword and Sorcery, or most any kind of fantasy, from the literary heights of a Lewis or Tolkien down to the lows of whoever it was who wrote those Gor books, for example- you owe it to yourself to read Once and Future King. Not only is it a great and emotional and well told story on it's own, and the rare fantasy that appeals to women as much as men- it is a great telling of the legends that have made so much of English literature so rich.	2005-10-11

I'm always on the lookout for good fingerpicking books, and I was lucky enough to stumble across this.  I mainly bought the book for the 5 Alex de Grassi transcriptions, though I have since fallen in love with all 18 songs.<br /><br />Windham Hill Guitar Sampler provides a range of difficulty that will please both intermediate and advanced players.  For the jammers, songs with multiple guitar parts are included, such as Dolphins and Pavanne.<br /><br />Best of all, selections from this book are diverse enough to keep you interested and playing for hours on end.  I have found that many books in this genre provide only a single sound- every song sounds the same as the next.  You end up learning one or two, and then retiring the book due to boredom.  With Windham Hill Guitar Sampler, this is not the case.<br /><br />Songs such as Andecy and Prelude from the Bridal Suite are classical.  The Bricklayer's Beautiful Daughter, Charlotte, and Window, on the other hand, are light and folky.  Even more diverse styles such as celtic/jazz and eastern are touched on with A Momentary Change of Heart (my personal favorite), and 36, respectively.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is a superb book, and I would highly recomend it to any guitarist.	2005-10-11

I have owned Kubrick's classic since its arrival, and it has always been one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Well, forget the movie, because this book is absolutely unbelievable.  From the very beginning, maybe from anticipation, but most likely from the way Mr. King keeps you on the edge of your seat, bed, hell...on your feet...this book is frightening. <br /> <br />Because of the masterful storytelling and descriptive power, I found myself, after the first night, not wanting to pick this book back up, out of sheer terror.  When I finally talked myself into it, I could not put it down.  Amazing how quiet, yet truly alive, your own home feels, late at night, when there is nothing but your thoughts, awakened by this masterpiece. <br /> <br />Truly unbelievable is the way so very many character's, from Jack, Wendy, Danny and TONY, to Halloran, Lloyd (who could forget good old Lloyd) and the undeniable Grady, are intertwined in a way the movie only begins to uncover. <br /> <br />If you like a good scare, one that wears on you from beginning to end, and truly appreciate the art of imagination, you must give this book a read.  Once you do, you will need to watch the movie, again, just to calm yourself down.	2005-10-11

B: the \\"God-fearing\\" Puritans, following the King Philip's War, proudly displayed Phillip's (Metacom) head on a stave at the entrance to Plymouth.

I feel like an 800-pound boulder going in to write anything less than an overwhelmingly positive review of \\"Between a Rock and a Hard Place\\".  How many people have said they'd give their right arm to have their memoirs reach the bestseller list?  Well, outdoorsman Aron Ralston actually did that.  Who, then, am I to judge his writing style? <br /> <br />There's no listed ghostwriter, and you can believe Ralston did structure and write the whole book himself.  A Carnegie Mellon grad with five years as a mechanical engineer, and well versed in outdoor literature, Ralston comes off as a talented writer (one would hope, however, that he'd avoid the inevitable trap of making his next book a thinly veiled roman-a-clef about a trapped rock climber).  However, the book is bogged down by two authorial -- if not editorial -- decisions: <br /> <br />First, the writing style is very technical, and therefore dense.  I'm not an outdoorsman; probably the most extreme things I've done in my adult life are to climb the Diamond Head on Oahu, which really just involved walking up a lot of stairs; and an extremely little bit of caving outside of Rapid City, South Dakota.  Although Ralston cites to Jon Krakauer as a writing inspiration, he lacks Krakauer's ability to make the extraordinary seem achievable.  I felt I could climb partway up Everest after reading \\"Into Thin Air\\".  After \\"Between a Rock and a Hard Place\\", I didn't even think I could ride a bicycle again. <br /> <br />Second, the alternating chapters.  I understand the structure of the book: in order to tell his whole life story, while keeping the suspense going, Ralston only describes his ordeal in odd-numbered chapters.  The balance of the book leads us first through his outdoors life, and then through the rescue effort that hastened his escape from Blue John Canyon and saved his life.  I found myself fidgeting during the earlier anecdotes.  While the black bear pursuit and the snow avalanche were gripping adventures, the rest of the tales really didn't add much to my enjoyment of the book -- and see again my complaint about the overly technical writing.  Ralston climbed over 40 mountains before the rock climbing accident; he describes every single climb, and I couldn't tell any of them apart when he was done. <br /> <br />I've already recommended this book to others.  I admire Ralston's attention to detail, his clinical look back at his own mental state during six days of captivity, and his sense of humor -- the line about his left arm on the book's final page is remarkable.  I don't know if I'd be able to go back and watch the videotape I'd made of myself, had I been the one pinned under that boulder -- and Ralston has clearly watched that footage multiple times.  This is clearly a man of extraordinary emotional strength.  However, his book could have been shorter and perhaps a little more user friendly -- and that's absolutely the worst you can say about it.	2005-10-11

Metal Clay Magic has joined a heavy hitting line up of books on metal clay.  I like the techniques in this book and the explanations of different types of heat applied to metal clay and the results you get from that. The tools and materials section is really good, because it shows the little `hot pot' techniques up to the most wonderful of kilns.  I also like the division of projects, meaning the one chapter is for beginners and then next chapter is intermediate and goes on to using more advanced techniques.  There is a section for inspiration, resources and suppliers and suggested reading that I find not really long, very well presented.  I also liked the idea of using sheet metal clay in what seemed to me unique ways, and of combing metal clay with glass and gemstones.  I'd never thought of making a metal clay ring and that was fascinating also.  This seems like a good book for the metal clay enthusiasts.  (For more info go to: [...])	2005-10-11

Inheriting the Holy Land by Jennifer Miller is simply an amazing story and synthesis of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on her experience with Camp Seeds of Peace, relationships with young people from a wide variety of viewpoints, and interviews with regional leaders young and old. It also illustrates how important a sense of identity is to people who must make peace. How does the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in an oil-less part of the Middle-east, and involving only a couple million people, attract so much attention and passion worldwide? Besides the ramifications of this conflict across the muslim world, I believe there is something more. If Israelis and Palestinians can resolve their problems and achieve peace, it would give such hope that larger societies in the world might also be able to resolve other conflicts across cultural and ethnic divides now and in the future. Miller's perspective and analysis is not available in the daily and brief newspaper reports on this conflict. Although I have read a few other books on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I now feel much more educated and updated than before having read Miller's balanced, critical and brilliant book.	2005-10-11

Although an academic, the author's style is lively and far from dry and he recounts many enjoyable and interesting stories from many of the important masters. I heard many of these too as a young martial artist and they are still worth repeating.<br /><br />Using diverse sources of information and scholarship, the author recounts much of the known history of shotokan and, more interestingly, tries to recreate by \\"reverse engineering\\" how the principles and techniques of Shotokan were developed by Matsumura in his position as chief bodyguard of the Okinawan king, Sho Tai.<br /><br />The last section in the book reflects the ongoing stuggle to understand the bunkai, and the author gives many of his own unique interpretations. Some of these are truly unique, such as a bunkai involving standing on a staircase, one forcing your way through a crowd, and so on. I don't know whether these are the correct ones or not, but as any martial artist knows, each kata technique usually has more than one application. So in that sense Clayton's idea is as valid as any other.<br /><br />Even if their true original applications still elude us, I applaud the author's emphasis on the bunkai, it being my experience in many years in both karate and kung fu that the forms applications are too often ignored and not taught well even if they aren't, in favor of your typical, more obvious sparring techniques and applications. While there is nothing wrong with that, the techniques and principles that are implicit in the kata are one of the things that keep karate from being just a more sophisticated type of streetfighting, and a true martial art. If fighting is all you want, you can always study boxing or kickboxing and certainly learn how to defend yourself quite well. But a true martial art is more than that.<br /><br />I also feel that there are principles of body mechanics and kinesiology, including advanced speed, power, focus, and hard vs. soft principles, that are present in the kata that are rarely made explicit. For example, techniques can be not just hard or soft, but the hard and the soft can exist in the same technique, not just separately, and I teach my own students how to distinquish them, and more importantly, how to use them. But these principles are also rarely taught from what I can see in my over 40 years in the martial arts. The proper understanding and control of soft vs. hard principles is especially important in simultaneous block and strike and in same side block and strike. In fact, this is where some of the most interesting applications to hard vs. soft techniques come in.<br /><br />Clayton also points out that so much of the history and so many people died in the battles of Okinawa between the U.S. and the Japanese that the real history and applications have been lost. There is some truth to this, as he points out that Shuri City experience one of the most devastating artillery bombardments of WWII and was basically reduced completely to rubble, portions of only two buildings remaining standing. 60,000 Okinawans and 90,000 Japanese died during these battles, including many karate instructors and their families. Others, such as Kyan, starved to death in the aftermath.<br /><br />Other writers here have mentioned a few faults, but I had one main criticism, which is the author's insistence that white crane is a hard style of kung fu. Anyone who knows the southern kung fu styles, and white crane in particular, knows that it is a soft style, representing the Yin aspect, rather than Yang. In practice, a white crane practitioner is evasive, avoiding the opponent's strikes rather than meeting them with similar force, and precisely attacking pressure points and nerve centers rather than using power.<br /><br />In fact, much of white crane kung fu, of which there are several substyles, is actually Chi Gung, and also soft martial Chi Gung, although it has hard martial Chi Gung also, in addition to the usual empty-handed and weapons forms. It also has a considerable amount of chin na (standing holds, locks, and grappling) in addition to striking and kicking.ctually Chi Gung, and also soft martial Chi Gung, although it has hard martial Chi Gung also, in addition to the usual empty-handed and weapons forms.

God is a loving Father, and He wants respect, love, and frienship from us, but as a loving father or mother he does not expect that life should just be about suffering, if that were the case He would not have make the world so beautiful and wonderful for us to enjoy it.

Rene Descartes is often considered the founding father of modern philosophy. A true Renaissance man, he studied Scholastic philosophy and physics as a student, spent time as a volunteer soldier and traveler throughout Europe, studied mathematics, appreciated the arts, and became a noted correspondent with royals and intellectual figures throughout the continent. He died in Sweden while on assignment as tutor to the Queen, Christiana.<br /><br />Descartes 'Discourse on Method' is a fascinating text, combining the newly-invented form of essay (Descartes was familiar with the Essays of Montaigne) with the same kind of autobiographical impulse that underpins Augustine's Confessions. Descartes writes about his own form of mystical experience, seeing this as almost a kind of revelation that all past knowledge would be superseded, and all problems would eventually be solved by human intellect.<br /><br />In the Discourse, Descartes formulates logical principles based on reason (which makes it somewhat ironic that this came to him almost as a revelation). Descartes had some appreciation for thinkers such as Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes, but he thought that Bacon depended too much upon empirical data, and with Hobbes he disagreed on what would be the criteria for ascertaining certainty.<br /><br />Descartes was a mathematician at heart, and perhaps had a carry-over of Pythagorean mystical attachment to mathematics, for his sense of reason led him to impute an absolute quality to mathematics; this has major implications for metaphysics and epistemology. Descartes method was a continuation in many ways of the ideas of Plato, Aristotle and the medieval thinkers, for they all tended toward thinking in absolute, universal terms in some degree.<br /><br />Descartes in his first section discounts much of Scholasticism, stating that the only real absolutes are theology and mathematics; because theology is based upon revelation, it is therefore beyond reason, and thus, mathematics becomes the only rational truth. Descartes develops this idea further with rules of method, which include ideas of intuition, analysis and deduction. He uses some of his method to come up with his greatest proposition:<br /><br />Cogito ergo sum - - I think, therefore I am<br /><br />'The Cogito is a first principle from which Descartes will now deduce all that follows.' This permits Descartes to deal both with rational elements and empirical data.<br /><br />The other writings included here give good insight into the ways in which this method influenced Descartes.  His correspondence was one of the things for which he was most famous during his lifetime, and Descartes carried on extensive correspondence with people throughout Europe helping educate and elucidate through his writing.<br /><br />This is an important text; the 'Discourse on Method' is one that I read the summer before I went to college, and makes a good study for those who wish to see the personal element in the development of philosophy.mathematics becomes the only rational truth.

Classic Wiley.  Hyperion: USA, 2005 <br />Heart <br />Home Library <br />Collection of work <br /> <br />A collection of the best work from the late Ralph Wiley, this is not just a collection of his best work but also a look into the life and mind of one of the most influential African-American sports journalist. We see how Ralph Wiley responds to certain historical sports moments/ issues, such as minority owner ship, Mike Tyson and September 11.   <br /> <br />Although this book is a collection of Wiley's greatest work it is much more than that. This book illustrates the unique writing style of Ralph Wiley. Wiley exemplifies a style that is brash and to the point yet not arrogant. He writes in a way that you respect his stand on issues even though you may not agree with it. One of Ralph Wiley's favorite sports to cover was boxing he was made famous by his articles in the Oakland Tribune about Roberto Duran's famous \\"No mas\\" and his depiction of fights like Leonard vs. Hearns II. Theses pieces are what sprang Wiley's name into the infamous Sports Illustrated which he was a writer for since the late 80's. After SI he continued to have success as a columnist for ESPN.com.  The columns he wrote there were extremely personal. Columns such as WWJD (What Would Jackie Robinson Do), His response to the lack of African American ownership in the new millennium expressed his built up anger of major sports. Also his article Why We Need Sports Now sent a message to American people following the terrorist attack of 9/11.The book is excellent and a great book for any aspiring journalist. <br />	2005-10-11

However, a more apt title would have been \\"Some of the World's Favorite Haunts,\\" for it is by no means inclusive.  I won't contest the author's belief that the sites he lists are indeed very haunted, but why does he believe these particular sites are more haunted than others?  He doesn't give a criteria for why this is so, and I think it would have benefited him greatly if he had done so.  Nonetheless, a worthy read, with photos and web sites, and for the most part well-written.

(Thank goodness I did not actually buy it.) Unfortunately, these reviews are very misleading and as I read the book I was constantly waiting for some kind of miracle to happen that would justify the praise of the reviews I read. Needless to say, it never came and I was severely disapointed with this book. I have never read anything else by Luceno so I did not know what to expect, but he failed miserably to impress my very open mind. The book starts off with some decent dialogue and action involving the usually exciting team of Obi-Wan/Anakin, but goes downhill from there. While the basic plot has some potential, it and the characters simply fail to develop into anything interesting. Basically what happens is that Sidious leads the Jedi on a useless goose-chase that discovers no purpose whatsoever. Luceno uses the very valuable potential of several great Clone Wars characters that are otherwise very under-recognized, and again failed to take advantage of their possibilities. This book was very dull through and through, and I would have given t only 1 star if it were not for one very exciting duel. The one highlight of this book is the few, short moments in which we see Grievous display his lightsaber abilities. These scenes, in which Grievous faces several Jedi, were very interesting, but otherwise the novel bored me ruthlessly.	2005-10-11

I gave a copy to a friend of mine whose husband died of cancer and now I am sending it to my niece & her husband, who has cancer.   <br /> <br />This book has a good philosophy. Sometimes things happen for no reason. God is not sitting in heaven sending us bad things. God loves us and cares about us when bad things happen. <br /> <br />Rabbi Kushner says that when bad things happen, we'll ask, \\"God, why did you let this happen to me?\\" when a better response is to say, \\"God, help me with this\\". <br /> <br />This book helps the reader to remember that when we are dealing with any type of loss, e.g., loss of a loved one, loss of health, loss of home, God loves us and will help us deal with our loss.	2005-10-11

Shaw concentrates on the general principles of the airline industry. The author's approach is formal, he discusses each marketing task chapter by chapter, but his writing style is engaging and it is always interesting - at least for people who are not insiders. This approach has many advantages. Its formal structure makes it easy for the novice reader to navigate through the book and recall what one has learned. The writing is concise and theoretically sound. This book presents no anecdotes and irrelevant story telling, no exceptional success stories or failures that cannot be generalized. For instance, he describes Southwest Airlines as a very successful low cost strategy that has been successfully copied throughout the world by other low cost airlines. This strategy works because of the cost characteristics, the barriers to entry in the airline industry and the problems of traditional national carriers to copy a similar strategy. Other more idiosyncratic characteristics of Southwest (`relational coordination') are omitted here, because their impact on the airline's success is not theoretically clear. This is the difference between a scholarly approach and a typical business book. <br />This and the clear structure and writing style make this book ideal as teaching material. It can be used as an extensive case study or each chapter can be used individually as an application of the textbook marketing lessons to the airline industry. You'll find a lot of the basic textbook concepts in this book such as the Porter model, the Boston matrix and the Ansoff matrix, etc. Another advantage is that the book covers the world market and not only one part of the world. I often come across books that claim to explain \\"The XY industry\\" yet discuss exclusively the situation in the US market. On the downside: Shaw does not go beyond these simple models and it never gets quantitative. For instance there is no quantitative model for fare pricing. In general, there is little quantitative data presented, although the two tables about the cost structure of an airline included are especially interesting. A clear disadvantage is the almost total lack of literature references and further readings. Shaw expresses clearly his own ideas but he never mentions that other writers might have different views on a particular issue.  <br />Overall, this book is a good example for an informative description of an industry. Other authors who want to write about a specific industry should use this as a kind of blueprint. Too many typos for a 5th edition though.	2005-10-11

Let me start by saying that this book is fantastic. There are some Pros and Cons to it however... <br /> <br />Pros: The out-of-the-box thinking refreshes moves and positions that most grapplers don't currently use. The Half-Guard in this book is a position of strength and a platform for submissions and further moves. Since most people try to move back to Full-Guard from the Half-Guard your opponent is baffled-yet-pleased that you are staying in the Half... until he taps. Many of the moves and position work with or without the Gi, love doing a collar choke from the twister! Fantastic job Eddie! <br /> <br />Cons: You MUST have experience with BJJ or another grappling system to fully appreciate the moves in this book. Without such experience you will be constantly countered and controlled. This book can ADD to your game, it can't BE your game. The pictures are B/W but that can be overlooked, however there are some where the angles aren't right and you can't see where the other hand is, or where his knee is, etc... this makes some moves harder to practise and master quickly, not a huge problem. A lot of the moves can be used with a GI as well, with very few or no changes, he should have spoken about that, but hey, it ain't my book right? You need to be short and VERY flexable, add some stretches to the next one Eddie! <br /> <br />All in all a very good addition to any experienced grappler. <br />Just my opinion. <br />	2005-10-11

This book, 'The Art of Chess' was originally written in 1895, near the end of his career.  Mason was born in Ireland, but immigrated to the United States in 1861.  He learned chess while working in America, and eventually settled in England in the late 1870s.  He played in major tournaments in the United States and Europe, never quite reaching the level of champion, but always seen as a major competitor.  There is a chess opening named in his honour (the Mason Variation); there is also another move (the Mason Gambit) named for him, but ironically he lost the only game he played using it.<br /><br />This book is a classic of chess.  The book is divided into four primary sections, an introduction and three parts.  In the introduction, Mason discusses general method of chess.  He addresses many major and minor points.  'A thorough understanding of the board is of the first importance, as without it no progress in chess worth the labour is possible.  It is in this matter that the young player most commonly errs at the very outset.  Mistaking more or less familiar acquaintance for accurate knowledge, he assigns the board a secondary place in chess economy.'  This last statement could be taken as a general maxim for many chess players - they mistake acquaintance or familiarity with accurate knowledge.  This was certainly the case in my situation.<br /><br />There are sections on openings (not so valuable as grandmaster strategies, but rather interesting to see the breadth of possibilities), as well as endgame examples, showing the power and variations possible with each particular piece.<br /><br />This is a 'classic', which means that many of the strategies and tactics have been superseded by later kinds of developments in chess play.  However, as a starting point, this is a good text to follow.  The charts and notation are simple to follow (particularly for the novice), and the insights into how chess is played is a good basis - more advanced ways of playing can then come later for the dedicated student of chess.ed is a good basis - more advanced ways of playing can then come later for the dedicated student of chess. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

One day in 1680 twelve Indian prisoners are brought into town, accused of plotting against the Spanish government. Turns out, one of the \\"plotters\\" is a beautiful young woman and gifted storyteller, Serafina.<br /><br />The Governor strikes an odd bargain with this Serafina. For every night that she entertains him with a story he will free one of the prisoners. Sounds like the Thousand And One Nights, but with some unusual twists. Not only are the lives of the prisoners at stake, and that of Serafina, but the future of the territory. Can the Spanish colonials and the native peoples cross their cultural divide and live in peace? Can the stories of the gifted Serafina bring them together? Or is it already too late?<br /><br />Well, you simply have to read this book. Author Rudolfo Anaya writes in a beautiful, heartfelt style, sprinkling his clear, simple English with Spanish words and phrases, to create a vivid impression of the old Southwest. Loosely based on actual historical events, the story is as meaningful as ever in a time when peoples and cultures are struggling to coexist. The stories are so well done that they become more than stories. They speak to the reader personally. This book is easily read but will move you deeply. I recommend it most highly.

Although I didn't have any wrinkles, I did notice that my skin looked slack, lacked vitality and I had to wear more makeup just to keep from looking tired.  I tried every beauty product on the market, but nothing seemed to help. I stumbled across Facercise while browsing through the health and beauty section of my local bookstore. It seemed interesting so I bought it. I began to do the exercises immediately, eager to regain some of the youthfulness my skin had obviously lost. My friends and family thought I was insane. They would laugh at all the crazy faces I would make while doing my Facercises. But after a few weeks, no one was laughing any more. My skin looked radiant and alive. These exercises even gave my skin a healthy pink glow. Just like when I was in my twenties.  <br /> <br />That was 6 years ago and I am thrilled to say that I look pretty much the same. No, that's not true. I look better. I am 36 years old and am continually mistaken for 26. My skin has no wrinkles, no signs of sagging. It just looks beautiful. I will continue to do these exercises for the rest of my life. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to look younger without having to resort to plastic surgery or harsh chemical peels. The results are nothing short of incredible. Thank you Carole Maggio for your wonderful book.  <br /> <br />Michelle Locke,  Charlotte, NC <br />	2005-10-11

Overall, the book left me wanting more.  More TNG characters, more exporation of both Picard and Crusher's thoughts as they moved through the plot and more of an explanation for the sudden turnaround at the end. <br /> <br />I found the various Romulan characters and sordid power plays to be a bit confusing and often times it seemed to detract from the prime or rather more prime storylines.  Friedman did a great job of winding them all together in the end to create some great drama as the final scenes began to unfold.  However, just as we catch our breath and the hero finds the girl, nothing.  She rejects him for no good reason!   <br /> <br />This is a good Beverly Crusher story, in that it explores some of her background and gives her a strong role in her own survival.  For Picard, we see his somewhat blank, if determined, efforts to rescue her but we never truly get in his head - we just get to see how he moves through his role as Starfleet Captain, not a man dealing with potential loss of the love of his life, but the Captain out to rescue a fellow officer and friend.   <br /> <br />As others have said, it would have been nice to see the other TNG characters actually have a role rather than just acting like they were going to do something but never actually doing anything.  And while I'm sure Greyhorse was once a good physician, not having practiced in years, we're really to believe only he was qualified to try to come up with a cure?  The cameo appearances by various Trek characters was almost as distracting as all the Romulan players and I'm not sure if any of them added to the story.  Even Sela's, the ever-present Romulan enemy, role could have been enhanced.  I would have loved to have a scene where Sela used Picard's feelings for Beverly against him or vice versa.  Although the Crusher versus Sela fight was almost worth it. <br /> <br />Minor gripes aside I enjoyed this offering from the Trek writing world.  It's been a long time since I visited with these characters on such an intimate level so I was glad to read the teasers and looked forward to finally having a new copy in my hands.

He can't get enough of GodQuest (or any of the other books in the series).

(Amazon does not show this as a \\"Similar Item\\" which is why I mention it here.)<br /><br />Since in that book, the brothers all have monkey tails and bat ears, the question of racism can be put aside. The first brother saves the emperor from a rolling boulder. the emperor is scared of the his power so he vows to chop his head off... and his brother with the iron neck switches places with him, and this repeats with all the brothers till... the last brother swallows the sea, then lets it out, and the emperor's ship is carried out on a tidal wave. The illustrations are gorgeous detailed watercolors and the characters are all semi human/animal hybrids.<br /><br />However, in this and other attempts there is a charm missing that came from the iconic simplicity and smiling faces of the brothers in Claire Bishop's version. I would eagerly welcome a non-stereotypical version that kept the brother's saucy bravado and magnetic delight.	2005-10-11

It's an interesting book about the community.  The 5-star is for the insight about how the community works and the various issues these guys experience while trying to learn how to pick up girls.  I think someone that buys this book will have to take some classes to actually learn how to uses these methods to pick up girls.<br /><br />In comparison, the System is a pickup guide.  I bought that book about a year ago while trying to figure out how to pick up girls.  It's a very simple, straight to the point seduction book that works very well.<br /><br />Regarding which method is better, I think that will have to do with the effort that the PUA put into it.  Once you have read the book and/or taken classes you won't get girls by staying home and watching the TV.<br /><br />The important point is that guys who weren't 'born with it' can now 'learn it' with books like these.	2005-10-11

As we rode along, whenever I tried to engage him in conversation, he politely asked when he could get back to reading. In part that's a clever way of ignoring his dad, but during the ride he laughed out loud in several places, and during the part about the wooden sword fight and deer-head stabbing, his expression was one of amazement .. he was truly caught up in the story the whole time he was reading it. He gives it a B to B+, and would recommend it to others. He said that while it probably wouldn't interest an old fellow like me, it was good for his age range. I call it high praise when the reader's face shows a wide range of emotions, as his did during the ride. Clearly, this book is a good read.	2005-10-11

But his early family life was marred by Duke's manic-depressive illness, and the question of who his biological father was (he now calls four men \\"Dad\\"). He made his movie debut in \\"The Goonies\\" when he was thirteen, and continued acting in various movies including \\"Rudy,\\" the recent goofy romance \\"50 First Dates,\\" and even created a sweet short film, \\"The Long and Short of It.\\"<br /><br />In 1998, Astin got the role of a lifetime -- Samwise Gamgee, hobbit Frodo Baggins' loyal pal and pillar of strength. So Astin gained weight, packed up his wife and daughter, and went to idyllic New Zealand for eighteen months. In this book, Astin reveals the hardships, the revelations, and the friendships from the vast movie shoot, and what came after.<br /><br />People just looking for more behind-the-scenes movie dirt may be initially disappointed by \\"There and Back Again: An Actor's Tale,\\" since it focuses a lot on Astin's non-\\"Rings\\" life. But this isn't just a \\"Rings\\" story -- it's Astin's story. He focuses not just on the \\"Rings\\" trilogy, but on his own struggles and triumphs. And his life story is an interesting read that seems to mirror Astin's own personality: erudite, funny, friendly, sad and family-oriented.<br /><br />But the \\"Rings\\" shoot is pretty fascinating, especially since Astin was right in the middle of it. He gives us a better idea of what his costars were like (Viggo Mortensen likes to \\"blow through a party handing everybody a copy of three different books that he's read, and then move on\\"), and how they felt about him. One particularly interesting part is Astin describing the time ex-Aragorn Stuart Townsend spent on the set, and the reasons why Townsend didn't work out in the role.<br /><br />Astin frank and candid, doesn't whitewash the truth, but also seems quite generous with his costars. Sometimes he comes across as a bit whiny and know-it-all-ish, but he's also the first one to admit it. Everyone has their arrogant moments, but Astin is brave enough to bare his unflattering mistakes before the world, and say he was wrong. And his writing (with Joe Layden as coauthor) is polished and literate -- not something you see in many Hollywood autobios.<br /><br />Astin also includes a load of personal pics. Most of them have a very laid-back, almost intimate feel -- the hobbits and their costars hanging out, showing off their costumes, bungee jumping, or filming (including Elijah Wood covered in webbing). Not to mention ones like Billy Boyd playing with Sean's daughter, or Sean and his daughter looking over the beautiful landscape of New Zealand.<br /><br />Sean Astin gives readers a glimpse of his life and work in \\"There and Back Again: An Actor's Tale.\\" It's not merely for fans of \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" but also for fans of Astin and the moviemaking experience.he's read, and then move on\\"), and how they felt about him.

The chapter on 19th Century tennis clothing uses Consumer Price Index data to show that a single 1892 lawn tennis outfit would cost over $600 in today's currency, thus explaining why so many surviving photos show people dressed in their formal street clothing. The chapter on photographic processes explains 19th Century types of photographs, and is a welcome addition. There are separate chapters on portraits, court action, tournaments, stereoviews, and postcards. Descriptive text is on every page; the author slips in dry witticisms that bear close scrutiny. Also included are many 19th Century non-photo illustrations. <br /> <br />I have never before seen any of these early photographs. All have strong tennis content and some are artistic gems. This book is definitely worth much more than its modest price, and will fit well into any early tennis collection or library.	2005-10-11

When one thinks of Plato and his ideas of politics, one naturally gravitates toward his best-known work, the Republic. In that book, Plato set up the ideal city-state, with classes born and bred to specific functions and roles in society, and a sense of philosophical outlook consistent across the board. However, such a society was unlikely to be brought out, in Plato's time and, as it turned out, in any other.<br /><br />Plato tried at different times to persuade rulers to become his envisioned philosopher-king; the last attempt was with a tyrant of Syracuse, who in the end imprisoned Plato rather than following his directions. Plato wrote this work, 'The Laws', as the last of his dialogues. Its difference from the Republic is immediately apparent in the absence of Socrates as a character - Plato at the end of his life has finally taken to working in his own right and not through a proxy.<br /><br />Just looking at the contents will show the breadth of this work - it involves practically every aspect of civil society: legislative bodies (and Plato has some scathing commentaries on some that he has known); education and its proper role and method (including even drinking parties as part of the educational process); ideas of monarchy, democracy, and the balance of power (some American constitutional ideas were generated from a reading (and occasional misreading) of this work); civil administration; arts and sciences; military and sports training; sexual conduct; economics; criminal law, torts, and judicial process; religion and theology; civil law, property and family law; Plato even argues for the need of a 'nocturnal council', one that delves not only into the practical aspects of the law, but also their philosophical bases.<br /><br />According to translator and editor Trevor Saunders, 'The reader of the Republic who picks up the Laws is likely to have difficulty in believing that the same person wrote both.' Saunders speculates that Plato in his older years changed from optimism to pessimism, from idealism to realism, but that this is not all there is to the assumption, because in actual fact the transition from the Republic to the Laws involves transitioning unattainable ideals to attainable realities.<br /><br />Plato describes the construction of a utopian society in great detail, down to the number of citizens permitted to live in the city (5040) and the length of time foreigners might reside in the city (20 years). This shows that Plato considers politics to be an exact science (indeed, despite the inclusion of the 'nocturnal council', he did see his system of laws being essentially unalterable through history). Plato is not averse to the use of force and coercion to set up and maintain the utopian society. Finally, Plato sees a self-contained kind of society that is likely to become xenophobic to the extreme, with less tolerance toward its own citizens than toward those foreigners permitted to live and work in the city.

This shows that Plato considers politics to be an exact science (indeed, despite the inclusion of the 'nocturnal council', he did see his system of laws being essentially unalterable through history). Plato is not averse to the use of force and coercion to set up and maintain the utopian society. Finally, Plato sees a self-contained kind of society that is likely to become xenophobic to the extreme, with less tolerance toward its own citizens than toward those foreigners permitted to live and work in the city.

Hopgood\\", and \\"The Haunting of Hiram\\" are all the same story by the same author. Just a different title and different cover art, same book inside. This is not the author's fault by the way, it is just that 2 publishers have the right to publish, Puffin and Macmillan, and this is what they have done. For some reason that is done with another book from this author, \\"Island of the Aunts\\" is also released as \\"Monster Mission\\". Personally, I like the artwork on the Macmillan covers from England better.<br /><br />On to the story - This is a book about a rich Texan that buys a Scottish Castle named Carra from the last heir of an old family, an orphan boy. But he does not want any ghosts included as he is worried that they will scare the little girl that will live in the castle.  The millionaire ships the whole thing stone by stone and rebuilds it in Texas. But the castle does have ghosts, very nice ones who have helped raise the boy. They include a viking, a ghost dog, and Miss Spinks. What the millionaire does not notice is that the ghosts do come with the castle. The boy flies to America to get the ghosts out and stays in the castle. When they learn they cannot stay, they move into an old movie theater next door, where they meet the mysterious ghost hand. Somehow, he is trying to solve the mystery of his murder many years ago. And when the little girl is kidnapped for ransom, the ghosts must join the effort to rescue her and the boy.<br /><br />This book is suspenseful, but laugh-out-loud hilarious. The author creates the most charming and imaginative characters you can imagine. I strongly reccommend!	2005-10-11

Tori Carrington's \\"Sofie Metropolis\\" centered around Sophie,  who left her waitressing job in her family's Greek restaurant and worked as a private investigator in her uncle's detective agency. As she discovered her husband to be unfaithful to her on their wedding day, Sophie decided to keep all the wedding gifts, including an apartment complex that her parents gave as their wedding gift. In her position as a PI, Sophie had to deal with a wide range of cases; from missing dog, to the disappearance of a neighborhood elderly (whom rumored had it became a vampire), to catching a woman who was supposedly having an affair. In the midst of this, her mother was constantly meddling with her affairs, especially parading eligible Greek men to Sophie. <br /> <br />I enjoy this book as the main character, Sophie, who constantly find herself in dangerous situations without meaning to. Some readers believed that this book is quite similiar to the Stephanie Plum series and I agree that there are some similiarities. However, this was more than just a mystery book as there is somewhat a \\"chick lit\\" theme to it. This was definitely a fun book to read.  <br />	2005-10-11

I'm sorry, but I have to say it was quite a struggle to get through this, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

It's still the most organized, comprehensive, and easy-to-follow halachic compendium that you'll find anywhere.<br /><br />Rav Bodner begins by pulling the rug from under one of the most widely-held misconceptions regarding muktza--that it's synonymous with \\"tool made for forbidden work\\" (kli she'melachto l'issur).  Not the case!  In fact, the class of \\"tools\\" is just one type of muktza among many, and it's actually a fairly lenient one.  The laws of moving rocks and raw meat are more stringent than the laws of moving a pen or a power drill.  Surprised?  Read this book, and you'll be able to answer such puzzlers as, why is sand at the beach muktza, but sand in a sandbox is not?  Or why are we more lenient about moving an unlit match than a match that has been lit and blown out?  If you've ever scratched your head over an inscrutable muktza din in Shmirat Shabbat Kehilchata, this is the book for you.  More about principles than about practical halacha, the book delves deep into the theory behind the halachos before moving to applications.  Detailed footnotes (in Hebrew) go into Shas, Shulhan Aruch, Mishneh Brureh, and various poskim whenever a disagreement or question arises.  You will need some Hebrew reading ability, since technical terms are given in unpointed Hebrew.<br /><br />Other authors writing in the same genre are Shimon Eider, Simcha Bunim Cohen, and Binyomin Forst.  They're good (especially Eider), but Bodner is the master.	2005-10-11

Unlike his first book of poems (\\"War Cries\\"), which is an earthy, gritty and sometimes shocking collection of military poems, this second book is gentle, romantic and soothing. When compared, the two books demonstrate the expansive nature of his creativity.  <br /> <br />Beauty & the Beast starts with a quote by St. Augustine (\\"Better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all\\") and ends with a poem dedicated to his 13 year old niece and oldest godchild (\\"Bound by Love\\"). <br /> <br />In between are poems dedicated to Sarah (\\"There is no beauty . . . Like that of an angel . . . No softness . . . That compares to her wings\\"); Jamie (\\"The snow falls and each flake . . . Reminds me of you . . . Beautiful and distinct . . .

It's always a delight to find an author who creates characters in three dimensions instead of the more usual two; Morgan seems to stretch his people to five or six. This is the third novel in the series about Takeshi Kovacs, ex-Envoy, stone killer, freelance renegade, and very dangerous man to be on the wrong side of. It's been three centuries, objective time, and Kovacs is back on Harlan's World, where he originally came from. It's also been a couple of centuries since the Resettlement, the failed Quellist revolution that gave the Harlan family oligarchy a run for its money, and Kovacs -- who only wants to continue killing fundamentalist priests (it's personal) -- finds himself caught up, first, in the attempt to reclaim the nanoware-drenched continent the revolution produced, and, later, in a new revolutionary plot. Because it's part of Quell's teachings, that when things go against you, you retreat and you wait -- for generations, if necessary. But now, just maybe, Quellquist Falconer might be back, in the flesh. But that's just this novel's top-level plot. There's also Kovacs's vendetta against those who let die the only woman who mattered to him -- Real Death, no resleeving. And there's his longstanding relationships with the several criminal cultures of Harlan's World, and with his old Envoy trainer. Not to even mention being hunted by a younger, smart-assed version of himself. And, just out of sight, there are the vanished Martians, about whom we learned a lot in Morgan's second book, Broken Angels. There's military and political philosophy here, all of it cynical, there's imaginative anthropology, there's a certain amount of gruff sex, there are some great quotes, there's considerable death (some deserved, some not), and there are breath-grabbing battle scenes like you haven't read in years. Morgan's second Kovacs novel was twice as good as his first. This one is three times as good as his second. If this one doesn't win both the Hugo and the Nebula, there's no justice. But, hey -- Kovacs already knows that.<br /><br />PS -- I was astonished a previous reviewer compared this to Bester's _The Stars My Destination_.

Besides one's understanding of the world, Smith uses the word \\"worldview\\" to signify a \\"way of life,\\" \\"the story of the world\\" and of God's people, \\"aesthetics,\\" \\"religious sensibility,\\" and \\"attitude on life\\" (xiii). Thus, for Smith, the doctrine of the Trinity is not just a doctrine; it is a truth that encompasses all aspects of reality. <br /> <br />Smith begins by outlining the basics of the biblical teaching of the Trinity. Perhaps more than any other doctrine, the Trinity is universally affirmed by all branches of Christ's church. Thus, this book may be profitably read by Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant Christians. Smith states that the Trinity may be established from Scripture by proving the following five propositions: \\"there is one God; the Father is God; the Son is God; the Spirit is God; and the Father, Son, and Spirit are distinguishable persons in relationship with one another\\" (3). The doctrine of the Trinity must be discovered in Scripture and believed by faith rather than arrived at by reason. Scripture, therefore, is the key. \\"God's revelation in His Word is our ultimate standard for judging all that we know and learn, while it presupposes that God is revealing Himself in every thing that He created and in the process of history as well\\" (14). <br /> <br />Based upon his brief introduction to the biblical basis of the Trinity, Smith spends the rest of book exploring its implications in every realm of truth. Though the doctrine of the Trinity may seem difficult or even contradictory, \\"truth is an entirely rational and perfect system, for God cannot contradict Himself\\" (17). God as Trinity is a personal God, interacting in fellowship within Himself. Christianity is the only religion whose God is not only absolute but also personal. Thus, God Himself is the ground of all personal virtues like righteousness, faithfulness, and goodness. For instance, \\"righteousness for the triune God means that each of the persons respects and preserves the boundaries of the others\\" (19). <br /> <br />Probably the best portion of Smith's book is in Chapters 3, in which he explores the truth that \\"what God does in history reveals who He is in eternity\\" (31). The nature of God is the foundation of all earthly relationships. In God, the essence or bond of the relationship between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is love. \\"God's covenant love for His people reflects something deeper and more wonderful: the eternal self-denying love that each of the Persons of the Trinity has for the others\\" (38). Men who live in a covenant relationship with God indwell within God and God within them. \\"God in His saving grace brings His people into that same covenantal love that is shared by the Persons of the Trinity\\" (45). Also, highly significant in this regard is Smith's work on the essence of a worldview, which I would categorize into metaphysics (transcendence), priority (hierarchy), ethics (commandments), epistemology (sanctions), and teleology (succession). <br /> <br />Throughout the rest of the book Smith discusses many issues that may be traced directly to one's worldview. He demonstrates the superiority of the Christian view of the origin of the world over the Big Bang theory. His view of Christian cosmogony is essentially covenantal. \\"The covenantal meaning of the world, then, is that the world is the love gift of the Father through the Spirit to the Son. It is an expression of the covenantal fellowship of love in the Trinity, an aspect of their mutual enjoyment of one another\\" (58). This understanding also establishes a symbolic view of reality. Furthermore, Smith discusses God's purpose for creation, His revelation of Himself to creation, and God's work in history-including the \\"problem\\" of evil, miracles, the incarnation, the gospel, the kingdom of God, and the great commission. Each of these issues is properly understood only within a Christian, Trinitarian world. <br /> <br />Smith continues by describing the significance of the Trinity to an individual's role in society. He answers questions that concern the relationship between an individual and the society in which he lives. He states, \\"our self-who we are-is determined by our relationships, just as the three Persons of the Trinity are who they are in their mutual relationships\\" (163). He speaks of the covenantal institutions that God has established in the family, the church, and the state. To end, Smith deals with the issues concerning eternity: hell, heaven, and eschatology. Only as the Christian understands these topics in relation to the Trinity can he adequately live consistently with the biblical teaching. Our understanding of who God is and our relationship with God as Father, Son, and Spirit guide us in our expectation of heaven and the end of time. \\"The enjoyment of God includes the enjoyment of all the things He created and of every gift He gives. ... Every biblical expression that points to the fullness of our salvation leads us to contemplate the greatness and wonder of God Himself. In order for us to enjoy and glorify Him as we should, Paul tells us that we will be made like Him\\" (201). <br /> <br />Without a doubt this book is foundational to a completely and distinctively biblical worldview. Especially for those who are not yet familiar with thinking in presuppositional or worldview terms, Trinity & Reality demonstrates that everything a Christian knows and does finds its source in our God. Highly recommended for Christians from all traditions!	2005-10-11

This Part should be easy review for most experienced readers.<br /><br />Part 2 describes the architecture and schema management used under 10g. And by the way, the book is focused on 10g; not on earlier versions. This Part is well worth understanding. It is here that the basic design information for laying out your database is to be found. You also find numerous utilities provided by Oracle, like the System Monitor, that help your management of the database.<br /><br />Some later Parts are straightforward but somewhat mundane. Specifically about installing 10g and making databases, and about loading data and backing up your data. To a DBA, this are vital tasks; don't get me wrong. But there's nothing too complicated here. And if you are a developer, these Parts can be safely skipped.<br /><br />Part 7, on performance tuning, is also where a developer should profitably check out. In tandem with understanding the basic layout of your tables, this Part may let you overcome bottlenecks.<br /><br />Given the size of the book, perhaps the best way to approach it is to focus on a single suitable Part at a time. Each Part is long enough to ensure a serious commitment of your attention, but still not be overwhelming.	2005-10-11

Thinking about Race and Racism in your everyday life.     <br /> <br />Read this book and when you've read a paragraph or every chapter and checklist, take a moment to feel what it makes you feel.  Anger, disappointment, disgust, laughter, revenge, and frustration, or none of the above.  That's where you are, that's where we are as a nation and society. The feeling you walk away with when you read this book is yours.   <br /> <br />Sadly, we all own the knowledge that no matter how you spin it, Race is still part of our society, and it will continue to be.  ayo shapes it in a way that repackages it, reformats it in the language of Wall Street and sleazy car dealerships for the regular entrepreneur. This is Race and Racism translated into the language of the Small Business Administration and prepackaged propaganda news reels and self help books overstocked in your local conglomerated mammoth book outlet.  <br /> <br />If you have 5 minutes for this book or a life time, How to Rent a Negro reminds us that Racism hurts. Racism is here; reverse, upside down and inside out.   <br /> <br />ayo doesn't work to corner the market on \\"renting\\" out her race(s), whether your Jewish, Irish, Asian, Mayan, African, or if you landed on Plymouth Rock, or if Plymouth Rock landed on your grandfather, she is representing a reality in which all our experiences are lost in a cultural marketplace where Racial transactions occur in a social hierarchy.  Will money, cultural status, and lust for the \\"other\\" always be our definition in our relationships?  As she points out, it is what sells, so why not sell it for real capital? <br /> <br />In response to the Washington Post's Jabari Asim, bravo for covering the book and at the same time, \\"move the needle off the skipping record for a second my brother.\\"  The premise of Mr. Asim's views are based on the idea that only other  <br />Men's thoughts are good and \\"intelligent\\" and not one mention of a woman's point of view or lasting contribution to the dialogue. I for one think Ms. ayo's contribution is a substantial one. <br /> <br />ayo by example of all her responses on the website, book purchases, national television interviews, and in the vast national and international (Canada) tour, has reached into places that McGruder and Chapell could only hope to go.  Maybe the reason men like McGruder and Chapell \\"mine the same territory with more consistent results\\" is because they don't just come out and say what ayo has said. It doesn't make business sense to go for the throat like she does.  You won't last long in the spot light that way.  <br /> <br />I am sure if she wanted to make money from it and \\"mine it\\" consistently, she could have lasted longer than any of them by sitting back and letting racism just go on by with a laugh all the way to the bank.   <br /> <br />In ayo's national book tour, people interacted, talked, hugged, laughed, cried, squirmed and searched out the issue of race together in the same small bookstores and city streets, once in a while people actually got upset in public about it. That is moving this society forward.  We are talking, we are progressing, and that does a lot more than running off to South Africa on a publicity stunt to promote the next season of a show like Dave Chapelle did. <br /> <br />ayo is not guilty of missing the mark; she is only guilty of hitting it dead on and if you don't like it, then you just might have found the darkness in the light.	2005-10-11

It is an introduction, but since it rarely explains where the claims of Objectivism comes from that it is not a very useful introduction. In this case one might do better going directly to another book. <br /> <br />If you are like me, and you only want to read one book on Objectivism because it was brought up in a conversation or something similar, this book will probably not satisfy you, since again, it makes claims that are not even remotely backed up.  <br /> <br />The author spends most of the book saying that Rand gives way to an objective moral and ethical system. To me that sounded like the most interesting part of Objectivism, and yet the author never stops to explain how this is so. I wouldnt have expected the full outline of such a system in an introductory text, but it would have helped if even a little of the path was shown, or even delineated. Instead we are asked to believe (with no reason for it) that this is so, and we are kept this way through the whole book.  <br /> <br />All in all, I found the book disapointing, and it was unable to answer my passing curiosity on the subject. If you are more interested on the subject, I would also recomend that you go for another book where a more indepth analysis is shown.	2005-10-11

I had been using the Time Out guide in the city, which is infinitely better, but I brought this guide on a trip to Colonia and Montevideo because it had much more information. As it turned out, nothing the guide recommended for Montevideo was true or even open. It listed two vegetarian restaurants, one with three locations throughout the city. I spent the better part of a day walking around the city only to find that not a single one of those four was still in existence. I then found a Lebanese restaurant in the guide and walked there, only to find that it wasn't open either. I thought maybe some shopping would improve my mood... but few of the places listed still exist. We couldn't find the reccomended Baar Fun Fun or the Cafe Brasilero. At this point, I tossed the guidebook in the nearest trashcan. At least for Buenos Aires and Uruguay, its much wiser to stick with time out.	2005-10-11

I got this book in 1998 to read a bit about the man before he was to pass away a few years later. For this reason the book is probably a bit dated now and does not cover his Eyes Wide Shut production. However in terms of insight I remember this is a great guide for introducing us into the life and times of the man. It covers his youth and upbringing and how he got into the film making scene. There are many references to Kirk Douglas and film financing, including Kubrick's interaction with Hollywood. In terms of a historical reference, this book was very interesting and I would recommend it in terms of being able to give us an account of the ins and outs of this man's life. The photograph section is quite well detailed with lots of early stuff. However the one downside to the book is that it never touches on Kubrick's motives. Anyway Kubrick was an illusive character. I have seen maybe two very small 1 minute interviews with the man in my life. If you are looking for insider information then you may want to read something like, Eyes Wide Open : A Memoir of Stanley Kubrick (Paperback)<br /><br />by Frederic Raphael, although this book was denounced by Kubrick's family, and to be taken with a pinch of salt, it is still interesting none the less.	2005-10-11

It's sarcastic, risky and right on que when it comes to addressing these renegade high schoolers. Plus, it draws a beat on many issues that plague both proponents and skeptics of the Catholic Church. <br /> <br />The obscure author is certainly a \\"word-smith\\" and will make you ponder issues, while laughing and occasionally shedding a tear. It does remind you of many of the recent school movies that mocks authority and life in general, but this novel actually has something different; a plot. <br /> <br />This was something different and should play well for grads of the 70's and 80's. It will take you back and put a smile upon your face.

October 7, 2005 <br /> <br />Encyclopedia Brown meets Napoleon Dynamite... <br /> <br />Francis Jones is a not so typical high school student.  He has a small circle of friends, is always looking for acceptance and has just assigned himself the task of locating a missing person - who happens to be his best friend and football hero, Ted.  Ted disappeared without a trace and the adults in the community have remained very evasive when asked about his whereabouts.  The adults' odd behavior and Firecracker Jones' overactive imagination formulate several conspiracy theories that just don't pan out. <br /> <br />I liken Firecracker or \\"F\\" - as his friends call him - to two figures from two different generations.  Encyclopedia Brown;  for his uncanny investigative skills and unique techniques and Napoleon Dynamite for his awkwardness that does not sway him from accomplishing the things that he puts his mind to.  With this formula, you have a likeable character, with a very active imagination and the ability to surprise you every time. We have access to his thoughts and his perception of himself and how he fits into various situations. <br /> <br />As Firecracker and his friend Oliver Chubinski (a.k.a. Chub) set off to find Ted, the laughs continue as this odd-couple finds themselves in one mishap after another. One afternoon, there's a break in the case and Firecracker uses his detective skills to locate Ted.  F, Chub and Chub's large bag of food make there way across town and what they find will change them forever. <br /> <br />Firecracker Jones Is on the Case is written in a style reminiscent of Judy Blume; where you get inside the character's head and start to have fun walking in their shoes for a few miles.  You live in his inner thoughts and experience his distractions and words from his imagination.  This was one of the best books that I've read lately and I will look for the sequel!! <br /> <br />Tyrone V. Banks  <br />	2005-10-11

Her attitude is not in the least bit disrespetful but takes cues, in general, from the medical profession where an over-familiarity with the body, life, and death creates a morbid sense of humor.  <br /> <br />Stiff is a wonderful book for any reader but makes an especially great book to get high schoolers interested in biology and anatomy/physiology. Of course, the same holds true for making college courses a little more interesting.  <br /> <br />Although I have not seen much mention of it in, Stiff is also a bit of a \\"how-to\\" guide.

Nicholas is a gifted storyteller and this debut novel includes all the ingredients of an exceptional read:  unforgettable characters, vivid imagery, fluid pacing, rich dialogue/prose,  moving plot, a timeless/classic theme, and strong writing. Nicholas delivers a powerful and emotionally engaging story about a young lady-Celeste Tyree-who comes of age during the summer of 1964-Freedom Summer.  For Celeste Tyree, a middle-class, attractive, green-eyed, red-boned, Detroit native, 1964 would be one of the hottest and explosive summers that she would experience literally and figuratively.<br /><br />Celeste would join other college-aged students from as far away as Stanford University, as close as Tougaloo College (Jackson, MS), who would journey to the backwoods of Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama to  make a difference in someone's lives as they idealistically hoped to  open doors for Southern Negroes (we were Negroes then).  These were people still living in a racially oppressed society which  \\"made children think less, speak little, and dream almost never, bending many of them into the hunched old people they would eventually become.\\"  The Freedom Summer volunteers hoped to make a great difference in someone's lives and  envisioned  \\"roads would get paved, schools would be improved, and children would be able to go into the library to read the books or take them home.\\"  It would be the summer to end segregation in the South.<br /><br />Celeste's destination would be Pineyville, MS where she would spend the summer teaching Negro kids history during the day and the evenings preparing adult Negroes to register to vote. Celeste would recall the summer of 1964 as one of terror and triumph.  It would  be a summer of getting folks to vote, watching friends beaten within an inch of their lives by those who were to protect and serve, spending hours in a jail cell, hearing about churches being bombed, and  deaths of innocent children.  She would wish for home/Detroit many times in her dreams, her walks to the outhouse, her daily struggle with the lack of running water, her soaked clothing because of the oppressive heat, her bitten and sore skin because of hungry mosquitoes,and most overwhelming and challenging at times--her loneliness.  It would also be a summer of self-discovery and identity.  Surely, a summer she would never forget and one that would go down in history as remarkable-and she would  be part of that history.<br /><br />Freshwater Road is an uplifting, compelling and captivating read.  Although the story floundered in several spots, and Nicholas didn't necessary flesh out each character, these issues aside, Freshwater Road is a very powerful story.  Nicholas takes us back to a time that many would like to forget and others need to remember so that history does not repeat itself.  Freshwater Road should be required reading for every high school/college student curriculum and every African American family should own one copy.  It is a story that should not be forgotten and should be told at every family reunion-so that our people do not perish due to lack of knowledge and we do not forget from whence we came.<br /><br />APOOO Rating:  4.5 stars<br /><br />Reviewed by Yasmin<br /><br />APOOO BookClubbombed, and  deaths of innocent children.

I liked the spare, heavy-on-dialogue writing, which probably comes easily to a man whose profession, prior to becoming a bestselling author, was about listening to people talk.  I also liked the characters of Delaware and Milo, but because this is a series, I often felt as if I had wandered into a room filled with people I didn't know much about.  I liked Allison less, perhaps, because I wasn't convinced Delaware liked her all that much either; clearly, it seemed, he still has feelings for the unknown (to me) Robin.  All the characters seemed rather cold to me, but maybe you have to get to know them; it's possible Kellerman has made them warmer and more appealing in previous books.   <br /> <br />As others have mentioned, the mystery in Rage is complicated, a Gordian knot of damaged characters and senseless acts of betrayal.  Structured like a police procedural, the narrative was entertaining enough to keep me reading, though flawed by the ending, which felt abrupt and unfinished.   Too, the killer's motives and actions seemed improbable, as did Delaware and Milo's uncanny deductions, and the convenient evidence of proof at the end.   <br /> <br />Then there were the two mistakes that took me right out of the story.  One occurred early in the book:  Delaware, seeing a victim's sleeping quarters, describes it as \\"....an eight foot windowless space....\\"  Later, another character tells Delaware that the victim had been alarmed the night before because he thought he \\"heard someone moving around outside his window.\\" The non-existent window?   <br /> <br />The second involved important plot points centering around a sexually-transmitted disease and holes punched in condoms.  What Delaware learns from an unfaithful wife--that she not only was always careful to use condoms which she bought herself, but that she had caught her lover in the act of sabotage--should have been proof that she could not, then, have given her husband the disease.  Why have the husband enraged because his wife had given him gonorrhea, only to make it impossible, or at least improbable, to have done so?  Because a) Kellerman needed a reason for the husband to be furious and vengeful at his wife, and b) he apparently forgot the reason he invented.  Errors such as these make me wonder if writers ever actually read their own final drafts, or if editors and publishers do.  <br /> <br />Rage is readable, entertaining, and flawed, and so I decided on three instead of four.	2005-10-11

Well crafted. I have to admit I found the first 100 pages a bit slow and couldn't imagine what all the fuss was about. But the payoffs are enormous as you close in on the end of the book. Halfway through it I finally understood why Oprah chose this book for her book club. Frey is smart, talented and ruthlessly honest.    A word of caution. Frey takes two deeply heretical positions to pull himself into recovery that some readers will find very threatening or politically incorrect. The first is that addiction is a choice, not a disease, and addicts always have it within their power to walk away. The second, which is a logical extension of the first, is that the belief in a Higher Power that 12 step programs require is simply another form of addiction, a fiction recovering addicts choose adopt to replace their drug addiction. Frey rejects both as fake, believing that responsibility for addiction -- or bringing it to heel -- lies solely with the individual. These are not positions I am used to hearing people publicly express. Some readers won't care; some will be angered.    Regardless, this book is worth reading.	2005-10-11

It is just SO weird. Of course I - and both my sons - had been introduced to Alice via Golden Books as so many children have been for so long. So there are recognitions all the way through. But the strangeness seems intensified because of that. Some of it is the dated language (looking glass instead of mirror), the dated social customs (like the telling of stories in poetry). But the humour is not of the 'ha ha' type, it is definitely of the peculiar type.<br /><br />Despite those reservations my son enjoyed the book, as he did 'Sylvie and Bruno' which we read earlier (even weirder and certainly less familiar - but it might be more inventive too).	2005-10-11

It supplies me with short, ready-made lessons, and I can leave the CD's with the clients so they can practice on their own.  Someone had written a review stating the book was incomprehensible; I think they must be talking about a different book.  The American Accent Guide is no more difficult than a phonics book or a speller, and is organized much the same way.  You do need to have a cursory knowledge of linguistics and the IPA, but anyone teaching or studying another language should know these things.  I've done extensive research on ESL resources, and this book and its CD's are better than anything I've found on the web.  I highly recommend it.  ~TC	2005-10-11

It takes you through his psychological developement as a child to the developement of his sexual identity and ties it all in with his drive as an artist and as an alchemist. Unlike other books on his life or work, this one fuses all the elements together: psychology, alchemy, art, the occult and sex. It's uncanny how much ground \\"Max Ernst and Alchemy: A Magician in Search of Myth\\" covers. If you love Ernst this is the only book you'll ever need. It's superbly fleshed out. I was left both wanting more and comepletely satisfied! I guess since this is the only book of it's kind it takes the cake. Rarely does a study of this calibre see the light of day!

If this describes you, think again! After reading this book, I will never again be able to think of the issue as \\"black-and-white\\" or Charismatic doctrines as \\"obviously\\" proven. In this book, Warfield: <br />1. Examines church history and various \\"examples\\" of miracles, such as \\"mind-cure\\" miracles (like those of Christian Science), Roman Catholic miracles, etc., and shows that we are in no way obligated to believe them, and that the case for these miracles is weak at best. In one particular section of the book, Warfield takes several examples of Christian \\"miracles\\" and gives examples of similar miracles being performed through other movements/factors, such as mesmerism, placebo effect, suggestion, and non-Christian religions. Warfield also critiques several miracle \\"movements.\\" For example, his critique of the Christian Science movement was extremely interesting and informative; for example, Warfield shows how Christian Science is not really Christian at all, but is really a form of pantheism. <br />2. Shows that many of the common proof-texts of the Charismatic movement do not really support their position. <br />3. Shows that the Bible actually supports the cessation of the charisma. <br />My one point against this book: I think that Warfield's arguments on the third point are fairly strong, but could maybe a little stronger. He does an excellent job refuting his opponents' views, but his arguments for his position related to the third position could be a little more in-depth. In all fairness though I am not sure that his primary purpose was simply to write an exegetical case for cessationism, and his arguments are strong in my opinion. <br /> <br />I woulddefinitly recommend this book to anyone who thinks that there is \\"clear\\" Scriptural or historical evidence for the charismatic movement, or who is dealing with the charismatic movement or has friends/family in the charismatic movement.	2005-10-11

When it comes to life insurance, especially in discussing what a rip off whole life (or any cash value, for that matter) this book is a must. Undoubtedly this is the best book on this topic I've ever read, and is a necessary arrow in your quiver when dealing with any of these scam artists who try to peddle whole life to an unsuspecting public.     This book gets down to the nitty gritty as to exactly why cash value insurance products are so bad. It dispels all the ridiculous myths that are hoisted upon us by sleazy whole life salesmen. Myths like: \\"Whole life builds up a cash value\\" (after they take out their ridiculous commissions. It can take up to 5 years before you have any \\"cash value\\" at all!!), \\"your cash value grows tax deferred\\" (Yeah, only because you lost so much money. You put in 10,000 in premiums and have only 3,000 in cash value. You lost 7 GRAND!!! Why would the IRS tax you on a loss??) The old \\"guaranteed rate of return\\" pitch is hilarious! Yeah, guaranteed at 3 or 4% The only thing that guarantees is that you'll be eating cat food when you're 65. Or even the unbelievably ridiculous \\"You can borrow your own money\\" line. Hey! When does it ever make sense to borrow your own money and pay SOMEBODY ELSE 6 - 8 % interest?! It boggles the mind what a rip off whole life is.  And then there is the worst quality of all: You might wanna make sure you are sitting down before you read the next sentence. When you die, your beneficiaries DO NOT GET THE INVESTMENT PROTION OF YOUR POLICY!!! For example, you have a policy for $100,000 and you build up $15,000 and you die. Guess what? YOU LOSE THE $15,000!!! Where does it go? The insurance company keeps it!! Does anyone in their right mind think this is a good idea??     From its piss poor rate of return to it's death benefit that goes away because the cost of the insurance eats into whatever flimsy cash value you build up, \\"Trash\\" Value insurance is just a bad idea and I would put my term insurance policy and mutualfunds (that are separate from the insurance) up against any whole life policy, anytime, anywhere.     Bottom line, whole life is a rip off and anyone who tells you any different is a whole life agent.	2005-10-11

He has read everything, it seems, which ever tried to touch on the subject of faith and science--from Plato to Nietsche to C.S. Lewis to Paul Davies and beyond--and his grasp of the fundamental issues approaches the terrifying.  His analyses of the ultimate logical conclusions of atheism and of the meaning and purpose of the Cross of Christ are more illuminating and challenging than anything else I have ever read.  I would rate this book as an absolute must read for anyone who has ever questioned the place of God in the universe and the meaning of human suffering.  This is not a large book--about a hundred pages with larger than normal typeface and more space than usual between the lines--but its weight cannot be counted in avoirdupois, or even troy.  It is not an easy read--most readers would do well to have both a dictionary and a collegiate encyclopaedia at hand--but well worth the effort.<br /><br />Update: 24 Feb 2006<br /><br />I find rather curious T. Hanson's misunderstanding (or ignorance) of Godel's theorom.  It did deal a death blow to a certain set of formalistic concepts, but it also bears directly on all of science and logic.  It is, in essence, simply an exploration in mathematical terms of an ancient paradox of self-reference--which may be summarized in the disconcerting sentence: \\"This statement is a lie.\\"  If the statement is true, then it is false.  If it is false, then it is true.  One implication of Godel's theorem is that there will always exist certain true statements which cannot be proven to be true. Alan Turing provided a variant to the theorem which, even though stated specifically in terms of the computing machine, nevertheless extends the problem of the undecipherable proposition to every aspect of the real world.  Gregory Chaitin of IBM constructed a \\"Diophantine equation\\" which infuses all of mathematics, and the universe, with a degree of randomness which even further extends the implications of Godel's theorem.  Which brngs us back to Plato--and hence to Goldstein's insightful application of Godel's theorem to all of science and theology.  As Goldstein correctly analyzes the theological implications of the theorem: Some truth stands beyond proof; the truth of God cannot be proven to be true.  Hence the claims of atheism fail in that they attempt decipher the undecipherable and to apply logic to that which operates on a level which logic cannot touch.Gregory Chaitin of IBM constructed a \\"Diophantine equation\\" which infuses all of mathematics, and the universe, with a degree of randomness which even further extends the implications of Godel's theorem.

Although I admit it has been awhile since I read this book, can still say that I found this book singularly unimpressive. He makes many poorly-defended claims and makes quite a few assumptions.    Throughout the book is a very disturbing anti-intellectualism. In more than one place, he refers to the intellect as the \\"enemy of true Christianity.\\" This is a wild claim that is not only unsupported by Scripture, but runs directly contrary to it. Apparantly, he has never read the passage that commands us to be \\"transformed by the renewing of your MIND\\" (Romans 12:2) or the passage where Jesus commands us to love God with all our MIND (Matthew 22:37, etc.).    One of the big problems with the book is that we don't really have all that many specific details on the exact structure of the first-century church service, either from the Bible itself or from church history. Thus this book (and many others on similar topics) must speculate quite a bit in order to fill in gaps in our knowledge. That's a pretty big flaw, given that that's the main point of the book.    I don't think that the author adequately proves that the \\"open church\\" model is the only - or even the best or most Biblical way - of running a church. For example, even if we grant that the structure of the 1st century church was exactly as the author describes it, what does that prove? Are the Bible's descriptions here prescriptive or descriptive? How normative is Acts for the church today? How much of the structure of the first-century church was due to necessity rather than superiority? For example, did the early church meet in houses because that's the best way for the church to operate or because the early church was forced to do so by persecution? The author fails to adequately address these issues and many more like them.     Many of the arguments the author gives for this structure are not primarily Biblical but pragmatic, and even then he fails to demonstrate that the structure is actually practical. For example, he claims (without supporting evidence) that people will be more willing to attend a church that uses this structure. In fact, evidence seems to support the contrary position; the fastest-growing churches in America are not \\"open churches.\\"    I do not particularly recommend this book. It is not very well researched and his arguments are not especially compelling.	2005-10-11

Even several decades after being released, this book is still arguably THE definitive and classic work on auditioning. It contains some of the sanest, best advice I have received on auditioning. It isn't your usual generic audition advice either - it is a very specific approach to a text that enables you to audition with it to the best of your ability. The approach is geared towards auditions (obviously), and so can be applied very quickly to scenes in the few minutes that you have to look over scenes for callbacks and cold reads. <br /> <br />Many of the techniques are effective for acting too. I find it a useful way to apply many of Stanislavski's ideas. <br /> <br />An absolute MUST for any serious actor.	2005-10-11

Sober analysis based primarily on the statements issued by Hamas itself and interviews with its political leaders. Unfortunately, because of when the book was written and published, it does not cover the impact of the 2nd intifada on Hamas (especially the assassinations of Ahmad Yasin and `Abd al-`Aziz al-Rantisi). Furthermore, one of my complaints is that at several times footnotes indicate that we can find the full text of certain statements of communiques in the Arabic version of the book -- however, one can imagine that these documents would be more useful in the English-language version of the book, since once can presumably find them more easily in Arabic (the source language) than translated into English. This is just a small gripe, though, and in general the book was thorough and compelling and, though sober and analytical, not overly academic in tone (i.e., it was pretty easy to read). <br /> <br />If you want to read sensationalized stories about suicide bombings and the like, this isn't the book for you.

It was a penance to have to put it down to attend to responsibilities. Arroyo's masterfully woven biography of Mother Angelica reads like a religious novel of the quality of A. J. Cronin's, Keys of the Kingdom. Her unflinching trust in God's love for her and her perseverance through various adversities, not only teaches us about Mother Angelica, indeed it also provides a succinct history of the Catholic Church in the United States in this era.     It should be noted that in this day and age when dissent from Church authority has become such a widespread practice, a dissent that often is a consequence of inflated egos and an unwillingness to be docile before Church teaching, Mother Angelica's staunch fidelity to the Church and its message of Truth is both refreshing and inspiring.     Wouldn't it be a further blessing if this moving biography were to be made into a motion picture? Mel Gibson, I hope you are interested. Many non-Catholics would be drawn to the Church, and many who have fallen away, I believe, would return.     I myself bought five copies and have shared them with friends. A young priest I know purchased 20 copies to give to young people in his parish.    I hope there has to be many reprintings of this book to teach this generation and others for years to come.	2005-10-11

And it's the best, most accurate representation of Coyote spirit I've ever seen in a book (and I know, because I'm a real-life shamanic practitioner, and Coyote spirit has been a very influential part of my life for more than a dozen years). Damn funny. And a religious experience at the same time. Sort of to Coyote what Passion of the Christ was to Jesus. In one part, Coyote turned himself into a hedgehog and sneak into a YWCA locker room soap dish in hopes that somebody taking a shower would think he was a loofa sponge. Like I said, just like in Passion of the Christ. And, if you can see through the humor, there's a real spiritual side to it as well. From a Coyote point of view, of course. To quote the dust jacket, \\"It is a cult novel for people too smart and too hip to be part of a cult.\\" It's the story of how Coyote spirit comes into the life (in flesh-and-blood Technicolor) of a Crow Indian living in Santa Barbara. Hilarity ensues, of course. But it's a lot more than that. To quote the book, \\"During the night, something inside him had changed. Each time he thought things had reached a plateau of weirdness, something even weirder had happened. The result, he realized, was that he was now accepting anything that happened, no matter how weird, without resistance. Chaos was the new order in his life.\\" And that acceptance is the road to redemption. A goofy type of redemption, but redemption nonetheless. My main problem with the book is that by the end, Coyote becomes more a stereotype of a silly Indian lost in time instead of a joyfully chaotic god. Actually, pretty much everybody becomes less realistic as a character by the end. But then, it's a book about Coyote spirit, so that didn't really bug me too much. Definitely a recommend read.	2005-10-11

Everyone seems to have a diagnosis as well as a prescription for our reputed moral decline. However, new books by political scientist Seymour Martin Lipset and by legal scholar Ronald Dworkin go beyond merely expounding a set of predetermined conclusions or recommendations and provide readers with analytic tools for use in the assessment of American political culture.    Lipset's title gives a reliable indication of the central thesis of this work, which proceeds in continuity, with a well-developed body of social science literature to which Lipset himself has been a major contributor. The United States is different from other countries because it is founded upon a national creed rather than upon the social bonds of ethnicity and history that normally cement peoples together. Our national sense of self is derived from a broadly shared ideology which includes commitment to liberty, equality, populism, individualism, and antistatism. This consensus does not, of course, eliminate all conflict, but it does constrict considerably the range of mainstream opinion to one or another form of liberalism (in the classical sense of the word). From these same cultural roots stem both faces of U.S. distinctiveness: the laudable (voluntarism, individual initiative, personal responsibility) and lamentable (self-serving behavior, atomism, disregard for the common good).     Lipset takes seriously the adage: \\"to know only one culture is to know none.\\" Group traits are best highlighted by observing patterns of variation and contrast. This insight serves as an organizing principle of his book, which includes chapters comparing the political culture of the United States with that of our closest kin, Canada, and of our fellow misfit (or \\"outlier\\" in terms of social indicators) inthe international community, Japan. Lipset's analysis of distinctive U.S. social, political, economic, and historical factors succinctly recapitulates the classic debate (started by Marx and Engels) over the surprising underdevelopment of class consciousness and socialist movements in the United States. Lipset joins such commentators as Louis Hartz, Richard Hofstadter, and Michael Harrington in seeing Americanism (the ideology of success that posits the existence of unrestricted opportunity) as, in effect, a substitute for socialism in the U.S. context. This phenomenon renders the American experience qualitatively different from the consciousness of limited opportunity and political power that prevails in other industrialized societies.    Lipset's use of contrast is not limited to cross-national comparison. Nearly half the book is devoted to \\"exceptions to exceptionalism,\\" social groups within American society which have undergone experiences at variance from the national mainstream. Lipset chooses three: American Jews (who are notable for how their unusual material success remains coupled with an abiding commitment to social equality), African-Americans (whose marginalization is linked to a greater openness to such group-oriented solutions as affirmative action), and intellectuals (who are more likely to embrace leftist approaches because of their alienation from market-driven populist society). In all three cases, deviation from the U.S. norm sheds much useful light on the inner logic of the distinctive American ideology. Lipset's portrayals allow the reader a revealing glimpse of why our polity is capable of engaging simultaneously in noble attempts to institutionalize virtue or to impose an often intolerant, crusading moralism while we hold fast to a construal of meritocracy which fosters a ruthless instrumental pursuit of material success that is largely indifferent to social decay.    `'America a unique blend of good, bad and ugly'' The Toronto Star, July 6,1996, Pg. J15    Canadians are fated to share the territory between the Rio Grande and the North Pole with the United States - a nation, as George Grant put it, that has no history of its own before the age of progress and which has become the dynamic centre of technological modernity. What sort of a people are these, whose destiny we share whether we like it or not?    Seymour Martin Lipset is the distinguished author of more than 20 books of sociology and political science. Even more unusual for an American, he has a deep and enduring interest in Canada. Continental Divide (1989) is still the best comparative study of Canadian and American institutions and values.     Comparison is the key to Lipset's approach since, as he says, to know only one country is to know none. The great observers of the American scene were like Alexis de Tocqueville who, when he wrote his masterpiece, Democracy In America, really wanted to know what made America different from his native France.    Lipset shares the view of de Tocqueville and others that the United States is unique among nations. He calls it an \\"outlier,\\" and by this he means that on scales measuring such social indicators as disparities of wealth and property, crime rate, the number of lawyers, church attendance, the USA is found at one extreme or the other.    Nowhere is this more clear than in America's treatment of race. On the one hand, the USA has treated Jews with extraordinary generosity from the beginning of its history. Although Jews make up a small proportion of the population, their religion has been respected from the time of the American Revolution.    However, at the same time as it was showing religious tolerance, it was oppressing and marginalizing its African-Americans.    One important consequence of American treatment of blacks has been the creation among blacks of a set of group-related values: They see themselves as part of a group and demand group rights, whereas whites are more strongly committedto individual rights.    However, as Lipset points out, affirmative action programs were introduced by Republicans, under Richard Nixon no less; they were opposed by black leaders at the time who feared that they would divide the black and white working classes, as indeed they have. This difference of attitude sets blacks and whites at odds.    Perhaps the most significant aspect of the United States that Lipset identifies is its moralism.    In Lipset's words, \\"Americans are utopian moralists who press hard to institutionalize virtue, to destroy evil people and eliminate wicked institutions and practices.\\"    Domestically, Americans often hold their politicians and political institutions in undeserved contempt. Because they think that government is so prone to corruption, they believe it is better to limit the power of the state. Consequently, the American state is the least intrusive in the developed world, but it is also the one that does the least for the elderly, the poor and the sick.    Another important element of the American creed is the belief in the individual and his or her ability to get ahead by their own initiative and efforts. Lipset argues that this trait is so strong, it even explains America's exceptionalism with respect to crime. Success seen in terms of wealth is such a fundamental value for Americans that they subordinate everything to it.    In foreign policy, American moralism has meant that their enemy of the moment - whether King George, Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein or some minor Somali warlord - has to be seen as the devil incarnate. The Vietnam war, Lipset argues, was unpopular, because Lyndon Johnson was unwilling sufficiently to vilify North Vietnamese communists, frightened of stirring up another wave of McCarthyite intolerance.    Another important theme that Lipset addresses is the question of American decline. Many analysts have sought to explain why America had ceased to be economically competitive; they tend to either blame Japan or urge that America become more like Japan.    Lipset makes a convincing case that America has shaken off its rivals, and has restored its position as the world's dominant economy. However, he is fascinated by the differences between Japan and the USA. Japan, he argues, is another outlier, and he devotes a fascinating chapter comparing American exceptionalism with Japanese uniqueness.    Lipset's thesis is provocative but by no means totally convincing. Too often the reader feels that he has chosen only those statistics that support his argument.    Even with these limitations, this book overflows with brilliant insights. Few people will agree with everything in it, but no one will close it without having learned something about our exceptionally annoying but also exceptionally interesting neighbor.    Battles between God and the devil;   The Times Higher Education Supplement July 5, 1996, Pg.23    In the late 1930s and early 1940s there appeared a remarkable group of young Jewish intellectuals in New York City. Gathered around the various alcoves in the cafeteria of the City College of New York, these students battled over the various doctrines that separated the pro-Stalinist Left, the Trotskyists, and Norman Thomas socialists. From among those ranks emerged men whose impact on modern American political thought would be formidable; it was there that the likes of Irving Howe, Nathan Glazer, Daniel Bell, Irving Kristol and the late Martin Diamond earned their stripes.     Over time, a number of those left-wingers became, to one degree or another, leading conservative thinkers. Diamond nearly single-handedly established the study of the political thought of the American founders as a serious object of concern for political scientists and policy makers as well as historians. Glazer eventually joined Kristol as co-editor of The Public Interest; and Kristol went on to found The National Interest as well as Basic Books	2005-10-11

Scanlon's review (although they obviously are more learned on the subject) - I keep thinking to myself as I'm reading, \\"Okay, can you get to the POINT, man?\\"  Mr. Cahill keeps veering off into these long-winded asides and I haven't come across anything vaguely historical or comparable to other books I've read on the Irish \\"civilization.\\"  It simply does not hold my interest.  But, in all fairness, I should probably finish it, but I have a feeling it's going to be a real chore.	2005-10-11

Police Lieutenant Lindsay Boxer is officially off duty and having dinner and a few drinks with her close girlfriends when an emergency call comes in from her old friend and former partner, Inspector Warren Jacobi. The pair had tried to follow a black Mercedes recently, following an horrific murder, but had lost it in the ensuing chase. Now Jacobi has been called to an identical murder and is following a black Mercedes which, he suspects, holds the killers. When Lindsay joins Jacobi in his car, she warns him that she's had a couple of drinks but is no way impaired and won't be driving. A high speed chase takes place and the Mercedes crashes, causing Lindsay and Jacobi to holster their guns and go to the rescue of what turns out to be a pair of very young teenagers. The pair allows themselves to be rescued but then change from a pair of frightened children into cold blooded killers as they gun down both of the police officers. Lindsay has to fight for her career and reputation in the civil trial which follows, and retreats to her sister's house on the coast for a bit of R and R. Unbelievably, almost as soon as she arrives, a series of gruesome murders takes place, with the victims being slashed, gutted and whipped. Lindsay and the local Police Chief finally catch the killers, but not before the reader is taken on a breathless race against some very scary people.	2005-10-11

The sight of children makes her literally sick.  When she finds herself in trouble after a one night stand, she must decide if she will keep the baby or get rid of it. <br />The final section of the story brings all 3 stories together and also focuses on Sam, Julia's best friend, who is suffering from postpartum depression and contemplating an affair. <br /> <br />Jane Green once again uses chick lit to focus on a time of a woman's life that can be full of joy and full of tears.

This literary masterpiece is now one of my favorite of his works along with The Scarlet Letter. The most obvious common thing both novels share is the use of symbolism. It is undeniable how his novel is delectable and truly a work of art. Combined with the horror tale of ghosts, the curse following generations, a hint of humor, the history and setting of the nineteenth century, romanticism, and the drama that follows, Hawthorne proves how ingenious he really is.<br /><br />The novel beings describing the old Pyncheon House, otherwise known as the House of Seven of Gables, and divulges the house's misfortune. The House of Seven Gables was built by Colonel Pyncheon, who was an early Puritan settler. The land on which the house was being built, however, belonged to Mathew Maule who later was charged with witchcraft and forever cursed the Pyncheon family before he was hanged. Almost a century and a half later occupying the house is Hepzibah Pyncheon and Mr. Holgrave and Phoebe Pyncheon, the young cousin of Hepzibah who is only visiting. Soon after Phoebe arrives, Hepzibah's brother, Clifford, is just let out of his thirty year imprisonment for being wrongly accused of his uncle's death because of his cousin Judge Jaffrey Pyncheon. When Phoebe returns to her home, the house is just as gloomy as it was before. Judge Jaffrey, then, visits the house and demands Hepzibah to speak with Clifford. After refusing, Hepzibah finally gives in and goes into Clifford's chamber to find that he is not there but in the parlor pointing at Judge Jaffrey dead body in the chair sitting. Quickly Hepzibah and Clifford take off to the train station and leave from the House of Seven Gables. Meanwhile, Phoebe returns and Mr. Holgrave lets her in, tells her about Judge Jaffrey's death, and then confronts her about his affection for her and she does the same. In the end, Judge Jaffrey's wealth is strangely inherited by Hepzibah, Phoebe, and Clifford.<br /><br />Hawthorne's writing is effectively powerful in the depth of this novel as he magnificently planned what may seem like a simple story really goes beyond the lines of realism and imagination. Although the book and characters seemed to move slowly because of all the descriptions and be a little difficult to read, I still grasped the concept and realized that the description served a meaningful purpose for Nathaniel Hawthorne, in my opinion, is one of the best literary novelists. The House of Seven Gables is genuinely a classic and a memorable masterpiece.alth is strangely inherited by Hepzibah, Phoebe, and Clifford.  <br /> <br />Hawthorne's writing is effectively powerful in the depth of this novel as he magnificently planned what may seem like a simple story really goes beyond the lines of realism and imagination.

I just CANNOT get anything from this cookbook to taste good, and after patiently trying several different recipes (some multiple times), I have completely given up on it.  My best results were passable; the worst were inedible. <br /> <br />The yogurt marinade for the \\"Tandoori Chicken\\" was absolutely atrocious, and tasted nothing like real Indian food.  Cooking times are consistently off -- if Bittman tells you that your chicken will be cooked through in 5 minutes, expect it to still be raw after 10.  Furthermore, the recipes may be \\"simple\\" in the sense of having few ingredients and short cooking times, but they are not at all durable.  Give your dish a bit too much time or heat (even if it's what the recipe calls for!) and you end up with an inedible hunk of leather. <br /> <br />Tonight was my final attempt.  Cook minced onions on high heat for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally?  Mine were carbonized in 3 minutes, and I just gave up and called in for pizza. <br /> <br />If you have plenty of cooking experience, and can improvise successfully around a recipe that's simply a rough outline -- rather than, well, a recipe -- then you may get decent results from this book.  However, if you're the type of cook who expects to follow a recipe to the letter and get good food, then stay away from this book.	2005-10-11

Clark does a decent effort at applying the formula used in doing feminist theology to his own community.  I disagree with his conclusions on ditching God due to many gay men's negative experiences with their fathers.  I think he would have been much better served in that area if he utilized Sallie Mac Fague's work on metaphore.  Overall, Clark did a decent job in exploring an area that has not been adequately developed namely the application of the gay experience to the theological enterprise. <br /> <br />Given the rudimentary groundwork done by Clark, I think the issue needs to be revisited now with a broader perspective given the advent of new AIDS treatments has changed dramatically since Clark wrote. <br /> <br />Once again, this was an excellent academic effort in the field.	2005-10-11

But many users could find these forbidding. So the text takes you into an understanding of what can be tweaked. You might want to pay close attention to the explanations of the security settings and the defaults.

The story of brain injured people is an important one, and my mother's book is the first of its kind to address the issue directly and forthrightly. Families who have never experienced traumatic injury will be shocked to learn that it's not all hearts and flowers after the person \\"wakes up.\\" As Mom points out, they don't go from being in a coma one day to asking for a spaghetti dinner the next.<br /><br />This experience absolutely shattered our family, culminating in a disastrous court battle of Bethune (my father and I) vs. Cramer over the management of Michael's healthcare and his financial affairs. These and many other revelatory facts and incidents were left out of An Excellent Life because they didn't align with Mom's goals for the book.<br /><br />What is communicated clearly is the tragedy and futility of a medical system based on insurance company profits. If you think what happened to Michael is bad, someone should write a book about what happens when there is no insurance money to spend and no lawsuit to cover the brain injured person for the rest of his life.<br /><br />An Excellent Life will make you cry.

Ms. Ehrenreich has an interesting writing style and I enjoyed the time I spent with the book.  I did not read it from cover to cover, but I read enough to get a good basic gist of her thesis.   <br /> <br />There are many more elements to explain the current state of the white collar world, and it is somehwat unfortunate that Ms. Ehrenreich misses several extremely important factors.  I tend to agree with several others that have reviewed this book in their statements that assert Ms. Ehrenreich's own political biases blind her to many realities that are obvious to those that have to leave in the \\"real world\\" (even Ms. Ehrenreich acknowledges that she has not had to work in the \\"real world\\"). <br /> <br />I am an electrical engineer by training, and have been in the workforce since 1985.  I have two Bachelor's Degrees, one in Physics, and the other in Electrical Engineering.  I also have two Master's Degrees, one in Electrical Engineering and an MBA in International Business. With the exception of 2004, I have been employed continuously since 1985.  I was unemployed for nine months during 2004 after being laid off from a high-tech start up company that was already in the process of going under, so for me it was a blessing to get out before the ship hit the rocks.  What really surprised me was how long it took me to find work.  Perhaps Ms. Ehrenreich was caught doing her research during a particularly bad time ---- 2004 was a horrible year for many people in the white collar world. <br /> <br />The two main influences that Ms. Ehrenreich misses in her analysis of the white collar world are the Internet and the current state of the public education system.  The role that the Internet plays in transforming the economy is so crucial that to not address it in a book such as this is to miss one of the very foundations of what is really going on in the business world.  For many jobs (public relations being one) the existence of the Internet changes the competitive environment in which potential employees must traverse.  No longer is the candidate competing with the other individuals in the main lobby, but individuals all over the world!  The effect this has on salary levels alone is enough to keep one awake at night --- simple economics says that as the supply of a commodity (labor) goes up, the value of that commodity (salary) goes down.  Like it or not, Ms. Ehrenreich has failed to grasp the cold reality that for every single American competing for a single available position, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands of individuals in foreign countries that are just as educated as she is (and these days, perhaps more highly educated) and are willing and able to work the same job at 20% of the salary.  To Ms. Ehrenreich's chagrin, there is no government program or policy shift that will reverse this trend. <br /> <br />The Internet is shaking to the core the very concept of the corporate organization.  This is another very critical reality that Ms. Ehrenreich fails to grasp.  Historically, corporations and other organizations formed in order to create \\"concentrations of expertise\\", groups of individuals that work together to create goods and services that require economies of scale to complete in a reasonable amount of time.  A good example of this is an aircraft company such as Boeing.  Boeing was created to build airplanes, and in their pursuit of this goal, they hired thousands of people that all pooled their talents and expertise to build airplanes.  Back in the 1940s and 1950s, in all likelihood it took hundreds of aeronautical engineers to design an airplane wing --- computers were very rudimentary, and much of the design work needed to be done analytically with pencil and paper, and the building and testing of scale models. <br /> <br />In the 1960s, along comes the computer and the explosion of computer software.  This technology has gotten to the point now where it only requires one or two engineers to design the same airplane wing.  All the intelligence has been captured by software, so the large concentration of engineers that once did the job by hand are no longer needed. <br /> <br />Once the Internet comes along, the two engineers who are designing the airplane wing no longer need to work at Boeing's facilities ---- they can be anywhere in the world!  This is a great advantage for Boeing --- they can reduce the cost of engineering by going to the markets where engineering talent is least expensive.  The company incurs no overhead in this process as well, since the engineers are not working at Boeing ---- they could be working at their own homes sitting in their underwear. <br /> <br />With all these changes, it is well worth asking what function the typical corporate organization performs these days.  \\"Concentrations of expertise\\" are no longer an excuse.  The exception to this is manufacturing, where large amounts of capital equipment must be situated in one location.  Under these conditions, the corporation cannot eliminate the need for capital equipment, but they do have control over where they place it!  Here again, the cost of labor enters the equation, driving manufacturing to places where the cost of labor is low. <br /> <br />I would offer that many white collar jobs that Ms. Ehrenreich has investigated could very easily be performed while sitting in front of a computer ---- and this can be done anywhere in the world.  With this reality firmly entrenched in the world economy, do we really need the \\"corporate office\\" with all those people milling about each day? <br /> <br />The essential fact about technology is that technology by itself is neither good nor bad --- it simply IS.  Technology will continue to evolve at breakneck speed, transforming the economy of the world along with it.  Those who reject this fundamental reality are condemning themselves to wind up in the scrap heap of discarded humanity.  As I said before, no government program or policy shift will change this reality. <br /> <br />The other main influence, the decline of public education, has been going on for at least the past 20 years and is a steady but elusive corrosion of the very foundation of our competitive energy as a nation --- the intelligence and abilities of our citizens.  As a technologist (and part time college professor of engineering in my spare time) I find it astounding that the standards of achievement and academic excellence, particularly in the mathematical and physical sciences, have been steadily declining at a time when the need for a populace that has a strong command of these subjects has never been greater.  Many public school teachers with whom I have spoken clearly have little understanding of the value of mathematics and science.  Most teachers dislike math, and many more will openly admit that they do not know how to teach it.  They reject the notion of memorizing pointless algorithms of basic mathematics (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) because teaching methods by rote is considered \\"primitive\\".  Others scoff at the need for mathematics, as they cannot grasp its use in the \\"real world\\".  Such ignorance coming from the mouths of those tasked with educating our children borders on the criminal.  Take a look around you at the computers we use every day, cellular phones, airplanes, cars, spaceships, roads, bridges, skyscrapers.  Every single one of these things requires mathematics and science to conceive, design, and build.  But even more important than this ---- mathematics cultivates in the individual who studies it a set of tools for organized and critical thought.  It teaches the concept of logic and organized reasoning, as well as the process of stating facts and how to prove their authenticity.  To assert that such skills are unimportant in everyday life is to ignore the current political climate in which thiscountry finds itself.  A well-educated public that is capable of analytical thought is one of the foundations of good government and representation. <br /> <br />The public education system in the United States is perhaps the last bastion of \\"Soviet-style\\" groupthink in the world, where the primary focus is on social indoctrination rather than a solid steeping in academic subjects essential to critical and analytical thinking.  Our children today are some of the most ignorant individuals in the world, but they feel good about themselves.  Educators are teaching our children to reject competition because it is inherently \\"unfair\\" that there should be winners and losers in anything; they are teaching our children to reject a pursuit of excellence because that makes you elitist; they are teaching our children to reject traditional family values in an attempt to rationalize the damage already done to the family primarily through left-wing institutions fueled by radical feminism and the homosexual movement. <br /> <br />It is already well-known by foreigners that Americans are, in general, arrogant and ignorant about most of the rest of the world.  Our educational institutions need to wake up to the fact that the very basic rules of economy still govern the world (as they always will) --  as the supply of any commodity goes up, the value of that commodity goes down.  If we are truly serious about reversing the loss of our competitive edge as a nation, we need to teach our children to be competitive, to pursue excellence, and to purge them of the notion that they are \\"special.\\"  Neglecting to do this at an early age only delays the inevitable -- when they get out into the world they will quickly learn that nobody gives a damn about how \\"special\\" they are or how hard they \\"try\\".  The winners in the world will be those who are the best at what they do.	2005-10-11

I can see now how lucky he is to be with me still. I live in the Cleveland area and thought it was quite interesting to read about the differences in knowledge and experience among the hospitals here. <br />I do not work in medicine or anything of the like and I have never read any medical books like this ever, but I found Mr. Ruhlman's descriptions and explanations understandable. Some medical items were certainly over my head, but it was still a fascinating read and I would highly recommend it.	2005-10-11

It's an exciting story filled with interesting, believable characters. Well, mostly believable. Some of the descriptions seem a bit unlikely - for example, Clay, the main character's on-again/off-again love interest, is incredibly smart, incredibly attractive and incredibly vicious (with a well-known sadistic streak), but he has a heart of gold and is committed to loving Elena (the main character) for all eternity.  And Jeremy, the smooth, smart, steady, loving father figure, is an untrained artist who accidentally discovered he's a genius, and whenever they need money he just throws a painting together and rakes in gobs of cash. Elena is by far the most realistic character in the book, and is clearly the one that the author expects most readers to fully sympathize with. Which is unfortunate at times, because it seems that the author cannot imagine that any reader would actually really want to experience what it's like to turn into a wolf. Elena treats being a werewolf as a curse throughout the book, despite the fact that she seems to REALLY enjoy herself when she transforms into her wolf body. The scenes of her running through the woods in lupine form, chasing deer with other werewolves, romping in the grass and playing tag as wolves, are presented wonderfully and joyfully, as if being a wolf is one of the most beautiful things in the world. But the author seems to present Elena as totally schizoid, because when she's not a wolf she loathes the idea of turning into a wolf, and refuses to accept it for the joy that it can be. Although I highly recommend \\"Bitten,\\" I get the impression that the author just can't sympathize with the idea of wishing to be a non-human animal, and she would probably think that the many of us who do are a bunch of fruitcakes if she ever found out we exist.	2005-10-11

Although George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff (1866-1949) is not mentioned, the copyright on the toasts to the idiots is his, and Van de Wetering surely knows it. In the novel, not everybody appreciates, and the crypto-Gurdjieffian hawker ends up killed. <br /> <br />Van de Wetering's are detective stories, although there is always a Zen lesson to be learned. In real life, most of the toasted idiots maintained a warm affection to Gurdjieff, and his legacy was passed to generation of pupils who were even more enthusiastic about a master they had never met personally. Just like Buddhism, perhaps the Gurdjieff legacy was translated differently in different countries, not only because of language. James Moore, Gurdjieff's only serious biographer and an old hand in the British branch of what Gurdjieffians simply call \\"the Work\\", has now decided to write - and publish - his long awaited memory. <br /> <br />This is not a book about Gurdjieff, whom Moore never met. It is an affectionate tribute to Moore's teacher Henriette Lannes (1899-1980,) a study into internecine political struggles within the Gurdjieffian community, and a quintessentially British book. Family and personal memoirs of Moore make the story more than a mere record of the Lannes group, but the book will retain its Britishness even without the intimate details. British Gurdjieffians seem seriously intent at remaining British while being Gurdjieffian, and the author confesses, about the two other main foci of the Work, that Paris was mysterious and the U.S. remote. This may in part explain the internecine struggles, although all secretive and esoteric groups are inherently prone to schism. Moore, however, delights in a style which smells of the pub at the corner, genuine ale, and Yorkshire pudding. At times, it may even be difficult for non-British to understand. When a character is compared to \\"Desperate Dan\\", one wonder how many outside the Isles may have in their libraries both Gurdjieff's canonical works and a collection of British juvenile magazines such as the Beano or Dandy, where one would find Desperate Dan. (We at CESNUR do, but only because our popular culture collection and the idiosyncrasies of this reviewer - and Gordon Melton's - tried to collect every single English-language comic with a vampire as a character, and vampires occasionally appear in these so called \\"British funnies.\\") <br /> <br />Apart from Desperate Dan, there is a lot the reader would never know about the Work in England without reading this book, including who really organized London's World of Islam Festival in 1976, the stormy relationship between Gurdjieffians and Traditionalists of the Gunonian or Schuonian persuasions, what the British Work community contributed to Peter Brook's movie on Gurdjieff and how it reacted to it (although, in retrospective, the movie may appear less dreadful that it seemed to both friends and foes back then in 1979.) Invaluable insights are gained about anybody who was somebody in the Gurdjieffian subculture from the late 1950s to 1980. <br /> <br />There should be a reason why the book almost ends with Lannes' death in 1980, although it is not stated very explicitly. There are only five pages about 1980-2005, the period when Moore emerged as the finest Gurdjeff scholar in the world and was, in a way, rewarded by being thrown out of The Gurdjieff Society in 1994. By then, there was an \\"official\\" approach to the Work which did not condone independency. Yet, as Moore aptly shows, what \\"orthodoxy\\" means in the Gurdjieff milieu is, and always was, questionable. Not only would Gurdjieff himself probably have found the whole idea of a Gurdjeffian \\"church\\" ready to excommunicate dissenters laughable, but by the 1990s (or, more accurately, well before, and including Lannes) almost every senior teacher in the Work was mixing liberally the master's ideas with almost everything else, from Krishnamurti to Turkish neo-Sufism and various forms of yoga. Indeed, the book vindicates Colin Campbell's idea of a \\"cultic milieu,\\" with Workers crossing borders to Scientology, Subud, Soka Gakkai, Transcendental Meditation, the Divine Light Mission, and almost anything else. <br /> <br />\\"Cultic,\\" indeed. Moore's self-deprecating humour occasionally leaves the reader wondering whether he is intentionally depicting himself as the stereotypically \\"brainwashed cultist,\\" somebody who spends years making puppets and preparing puppet shows as his main focus while the external world worries about the Bomb, the Cold War, and Vietnam, only to be told by Lannes after a minor incident that the puppets should go and be burned. Is Moore a cultivated version of Madonna answering critics of her conversion to Rabbi Berg's controversial brand of Kabbalah by wearing a provocative \\"Brainwashed Zombie\\" T-shirt? Yes and no. Gurdjieffians here are liberally offered to the external observer's gaze as lost in a dream. But Moore's lesson, Lannes' lesson and in fact Gurdjieff's lesson is that so is everybody else. At least, Gurdjeffians do know that they are asleep, and try to awaken. We are all brainwashed cultists, just as Madonna would say. Some realize it. Some don't. The cults of science, sex, money or business are not better, perhaps worse, than other cults. But, if everybody is a cultist, perhaps nobody is a cultist; if everybody is brainwashed, nobody is brainwashed. And this is, perhaps, as good a starting point as any for that self-remembering journey that the book is all about, although by the end of the story neither us nor, perhaps, Moore will believe that \\"orthodox\\" Gurdjieffians will be the only one who will, in the end, remember themselves. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

I rate the book a three because I was very disappointed with the ending. I did not like that I had to pick between which story I believed was true. The ending made me feel like I wasted my time reading the first 381 pages of the book. I thought the ending would tell more about Pi's adult life. In chapter 36, the reader is introduced to Pi's children. This gave me the impression that the end of the book would show how Pi went on with his life after the seven months spent in a boat with a tiger. I also was very confused on how in the beginning of Part II, Pi tells the reader that the sun had destroyed his clothes, but towards the end of his journey on the boat Pi tells the reader that he uses his shirt as a wet rag to put on his face to cool him down. How is it possible that the sun disintegrated his shirt in the beginning of the book, but Pi was able to use it again towards the end of the book? After reading the entire book, I was struck with numerous questions similar to the one above. I did, however, like most of the book. I found the beginning very interesting. I like learning about the three different religions Pi wanted to be. I was able to see the way Pi thought giving me a better perspective on three different religions. Pi helped me see how all of them had some factor in common. I also liked how Pi was a struggling young teen just like everyone else. He struggled with his name and which religion he should become. Many young teens struggle with similar issues. In the book, Pi shows the reader how he overcomes this struggle. He has the courage to go in front of his whole class and change his name. He also has the courage to tell his family that he wants to become three different religions. I believe everyone would benefit by reading this book. The author writes in a way that makes the reader feel like he/she is in the boat with Pi.	2005-10-11

The story is riveting as Ben attempts to adjust to a new school and cope with his father's disapproval.  Bull is a character you won't forget.  He is overly hard on his son, often calling him names and mentally abusing him.  Ben's dad wants one thing for his son- to become a marine fighter pilot. He shows his affection for his son in enough suttle ways, that despite his many obvious short-comings, it is difficult to hate Bull.   Ben is conflicted between following the wishes of his dad, or following his own heart.  Much of the story is autobiographical based on Conroy's experience of growing up with a strict military father.

Jane Candia Coleman, in her heavily researched Tombstone Travesty: The Memoirs of Allie Earp, has finally set the record straight about this side of the Earp family.  Like her stunning Doc Holliday's Woman, Coleman had access to numerous records direct from family sources.  For many years the media had canonized the Earp family, particularly Wyatt Earp.  Then along came a writer who, having access to the still living Allie Earp, set out to debunk the family, making himself the \\"revisionist historian\\" who could \\"tell it all.\\"  Worthy of note is that he did not publish it until after her death, when no family member could come to her defense.

A chess miniature is a short game, generally 25 moves/countermoves or less.  These are not the kinds of games that many grandmasters play, but they are very useful and instructive for those who wish to play chess both on an amateur and a professional level.<br /><br />According to authors Leonard Barden and Wolfgang Heidenfeld, 'the development of modern chess is toward ever sharper and more aggressive lines of play, in contrast to the quiet scientific style preferred by the grandmasters of the thirties and early forties.'  This book was written in the 1950s, and incorporates games from the 40's and 50's, as well as key games and strategies from earlier times that fit the criterion of being a miniature.<br /><br />This book contains the full play of many games, delineated in move-by-move summary charts as well as commentary by the authors at critical junctures in the game.  There are charts that show the distribution of pieces on the board, to help the reader visualise the games.<br /><br />This book does assume some familiarity with chess, including some of the key games and conventions of commentary.  For example, on game two (Hiedenfeld-Zietemann, Berlin 1929), the authors make the commentary 'Black avoids the torrential waters of the Max Lange Attack proper, which continues with P x P.'  This one sentence shows the complexity and the humour in this text.<br /><br />One thing I like about the commentaries in on games in this text is that there are alternatives presented.  When there is a pivotal point in the game, the authors show how a different move might have resulted in a different game and outcome - of course, such is speculation to a certain extent, but following regular patterns of chess, these outcomes are interesting.<br /><br />There are over 160 presented here, including an appendix of games played after the primary typeset of the book.  Chess continues to develop, but like many enterprises, knowing the past and learning key ideas from the past can only strengthen the competitor in the future.nues to develop, but like many enterprises, knowing the past and learning key ideas from the past can only strengthen the competitor in the future.	2005-10-11

There were interesting facts about Florence' background that were cleverly woven into this tale. I imagine the \\"birth of Venus\\" is her coming of age; the intimate tension between Alessandra and the young artist.  However, I found the dialogue distracting and too removed from that time period.  For example, right at the beginning, her brother Tomasso chides \\"You'd have to get husband first.\\"  The mother sharply asks him what he says and he says, \\"I said I have a dreadful thirst.\\"  I know this is petty, but often times the language seemed not to fit.  There were some sections that were totally engrossing and others that really took away from the story.  I was also disappointed to find out the artist's identity.  It seemed too contrived.

This book is part history, part theological argumen in favor of women's ordination.  Therefore, I will critique each aspect.<br /><br />I found Todd's treatment of the LCMS interesting and well-written yet lacking in professional integrity.  While her facts and dates are correct, her frequent editorial analysis of persons and events alerts the reader to an abnormal amount of \\"spin.\\"  Throughout the historical sections, Todd employs left-handed compliments and ad hominum attacks on certain figures, while treating others very sympathetically.  For example, CFW Walther consistantly characterized as a Stephan-flunkie who talks big but lacks clear judgment; J.A.O Preus was a manipulative politician who refused to listen to sound reason.  Meanwhile, those who challenge authority, Scripture, or advance the cause of women are--like Russell Prohl and the Seminary's \\"most moderate\\" (228) professors--sympathetic characters.<br /><br />Furthermore, Todd's presentation of the various doctrinal arguments is weak.  When she presents a view she agrees with (against Scriptural inerrancy, for women's ordination, etc.), she either presents them as self-evident or relies on brief references to \\"the Gospel\\" or socio-cultural equality.  While she uses much ink to present opposing arguments, she focuses more on the arguments' political impact and never really treats them seriously.  It never seems to occur to her that people might actually believe that an inerrant Bible prohibits women's ordination and that these people take this belief seriously.  In all, the author is too emotionally invested in the subject matter for a reader to trust her historical analysis.<br /><br />As a theologian, Todd fares much worse.  Her theology is one based on a subjective reading of the Bible as opposed to a belief that theology is objective--not coming from within a person or culture, but from an unchanging God.  As such, Todd is guilty of doing the very thing she accuses others of doing:  beginning with a theological idea (women should be ordained), then creating a theological method that supports this idea.  Her \\"support\\" ranges from insightful critiques of LCMS doctrine (e.g. an evolving theology of the ministry) to down-right silly arguments (e.g. implying that Martin Luther and CFW Walther never really believed in Scriptural inerrancy or a male-only priesthood).  Most distrubing are her positions that Scripture is neither fixed nor inerrant (allowing whatever a particular reader wants it to say); that amorphous words like culture should dictate theology and practice; that the Gospel has destroyed ALL worldly differences between everyone; and that one should be ordained if he/she \\"feels a call\\" regardless of personal qualifications as specified by Scripture (inerrant or otherwise).<br /><br />In all, I cannot recommend \\"Authority Vested.\\"  While I am willing to hear arguments on the role of women in the Church, the Ministry, and authority, I am not willing to hear such arguments from authors who subscribe to an \\"ends justify the means\\" approach.  Todd sacrifices the doctrine of Scriptural inerrancy, the reputations of fellow Church members, and sound argument because she believes her end is just.  I disagree and cannot recommend this book.ing from within a person or culture, but from an unchanging God.

Also, through no fault of Koontz's, certain aspects to the book are rather dated. Like the whole U.S. vs. U.S.S.R angle, and and some of the references to 80s technology.  <br /> <br />However, when the dog tells Nora that he would \\"Die of Lonely\\" without them, it had to be one of the most touching moments I've ever read in any novel. <br /> <br />How did this dog communicate with these two indivuduals? You're just going to have to read this book to find out. <br /> <br />\\"The Outsider\\" also reminded me of KMFDM's \\"Beast\\", which isn't necessarilly a bad thing.	2005-10-11

A country where the privileged class is the so-called \\"Communists\\" and, among them, the higher elite. Such elite has the best houses, cars, they are allowed to travel abroad, many of them shop in special stores, etc. Their main representative is the aging, dirty-looking dictator who has been in power for the longest time: 47 years this coming January.  <br />It is incredible that there are still a handful of stupid supporters of such a dynosaur! But they are not living in Cuba: they live in a capitalist country where they enjoy the freedom to travel abroad, buy and own your own little home, car, vacation resorts, etc. They just visit Castro's prison-island to see a bunch of people dancing \\"for the tourists\\" or to have sex with minors, or to \\"observe the natives\\" in the worst tradition of colonialism based on hard currency. Such are the likes of the Turners, Fondas, Garcia-Marquez and others who made their money in the very countries where they choose to live, but while criticizing it and praising slave-owners like Castro and his clique. And of course, a group of minor capitalists that go to Cuba to get cheap labor, even cheaper prostitutes and \\"peccata minuta\\" they can not probably afford in their own countries! That is the sad, depressing reality of Cuba. And it is pretty well reflected in this book. Thanks! <br />And, by the way, there was another review where they say that \\"caudillo\\" is a Latin American word. No! It comes from Latin and was used in Spain before LA. Our own dictator, Francisco Franco, was called like that during his tenure here (and he was friendly with Castro too!)	2005-10-11

Pretty much the enitre book is filled with theorems, definitions and advanced formuli that require knowledge of advanced calculus, set theory, linear algebra, and graph theory (to name a few) to understand.  <br /> <br />It has very little in the way of examples and actual explanations. For example, in chapter 8, when talking about equilibrium pairs, the book doesn't give any methods to actually calculate equilibrium pairs, but just give a whole collection of theorems and definitions that explain what equilibrium pairs are, and then referred readers to other books for the methods to actually calculate them. <br /> <br />If you don't have an advanced maths background, the first problem you'll have reading this book is just understanding all the mathematical notations used in this book. If you can get past that, then you're still faced with trying to understand the implications of all the theories and formuli presented in the book. Suffice it to say that I still couldn't understand 75% of the material in this book, even though this was a textbook for a class I took and I had a professor to explain to me what the book is actually saying. <br /> <br />I understand that this book is supposedly some kind of a seminal work in game theory. But it definitely is not intended for someone seeking an introduction to game theory or someone trying to learn by him/her self.	2005-10-11

I am currently using the book in my 101 classes. The first remark: the authors sell the textbook as if it were a comunicative method. One has just to examine the first chapter to see it is not the case, so they either do not know what a comunicative approach is or it is just a lie. It is a teacher centered book, no doubt about it. In order to give the word to the students I have to come up with a lot of interactive activities myself so they don't get bore and end up dropping. Overall I feel a great deal of imballance in this textbook: there little if none articulation  between grammar topics, vocabulary and cultural themes:  i.e., chap. 2 is about adjectives but it does not include the parts of the body and personality traits.In chap. 4 the verbs ir, vir, fazer and ver are not applied in any of the readings: absurd! Not to mention the misleading explanation of the prepositions a and para      used in conjunction with ir. I was outraged by the absence of a note about the colloquial use of \\"em\\" instead of \\"a\\" in informal language. I am a native speaker still the way it is explained there got me very confused! One can say there is an abundance of imput from real Brazilian university students in the \\"vozes brasileiras\\" section but most of the times I do not have time to do it all. The fact that the book shows only Sao Paulo  is definitely a weakness. The author could have dedicated a chapter to each one of the states, instead. Brazil is not only So Paulo or Rio de Janeiro, just like it is not only the Amazon  forest, it is also Caatinga, Cerrado, Pantanal and Pampas: it is absolutelly necessary to avoid essentialisms when dealing with culture! A question to the author: if the book portrays only Sao Paulo why then the need to teach students in the intro to brazilian pronunciation and later on recorded material the tchee and djee sounds that are definetelly not from the paulista variant? For me it is an indication that this book wascreated in different layers through time: it seems to have started as a grammar centered book with lists of vocabulary, then they added on some  texts, probably the dialogues with translation in the end of each chapter, then they added on the sections \\"vozes.\\" Then they got the vozes brasileiras, a new audio on mp3 to make it look modern and \\"voil.\\" The problem is that the layers often do not correspond between them creating a disconcerting disorientation and a disappointing challenge to the one teaching the class. The teacher's manual carries a numeration of pages that does not correspond to the one in the TB. It also does not suggests games and interactive activities: it just suggests how to present grammar topics and follows with tons of traditional  exercises. The speakers they chose for the recording do not have a good voice: I'm sorry but the girl's voice seems that she is about to cry! Last but not least in the list of aberrations contained in this book:there is a plethora of errors, I found a terrible one in chap. 2 when the author indicates a wrong preposition to use with states. Sometimes the author uses  continental portuguese lexical terms that do not apply to brazilian port without saying nothing about it. This book proves  that there is market out there for someone competent enough to write a real comunicative book from scratch. Meanwhile I'll have to stick to it because the choice was not mine (I would have turned it down  from at first glance just by looking at the uggly illustrations  and the poor, confusing layout. I'd rathe have the trouble to use a continental portuguese book that using this for another year. This book is like a Frankenstein monster: Brasil Lingua... proves that an assortment of unmatching text parts sown together does not  live up to the challenge of creating a fun and functional textbook! It is not suitable   for a class: I'd say buy at your own risk only if you are studyig alone and have some previous knowledge of the language \\"e olhe l!\\"	2005-10-11

The writer repeats herself numerous times in the first thirty pages, there are a handful of typos and some of her word choices are awkward. There are some very interesting ideas that she doesn't follow all the way through. (this didn't leave me confused but I wanted to know more about them)  <br /> <br />Even with problems, this is a book that teachers and parents should buy just to keep up with what is really happening in schools. The author goes beyond the simple \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" generalizations we usually think of when we think of cheating. She back-engineers cheating to show why students cheat, and why many parents & teachers & other \\"stakeholders\\" in education condone cheating. Child's thesis still shows that cheating is \\"bad\\" for schools and students but she also shows how we condemn cheating and plagiarism without trying to understand why it happens. She shows how students go to school in a \\"product-based\\" system, which means that their scholastic accomplishments are evaluated on \\"product,\\" or the end result. This seems like an efficient system but it is harmful because the student is never judged on to the \\"process\\" that went into making the product. Their effort in school has no value at all and some students take this another step to rationalize cheating where the \\"end justifies the means\\".  <br /> <br />The author points out that product-based systems are bad enough, but when combined with a need to succeed in schools and a culture of competition (high test scores, high grades, the need to get into a good college...) the students get a \\"mixed message\\" about what they need to do in their classes. They are told they need to do the work themselves but there is no reward when they do the work. They are only rewarded for high product and they are also punished when this isn't handed in. Child also points out that the same conditions affect their teachers. In the chapter on Accountability, she shows how some teachers help students cheat because they are caught in the same system as students and feel the same pressures.  <br /> <br />The term paper industry (these are companies students use when they want to buy professional-quality term papers) is discussed frequently. Child was a professional term paper writer and has reviewed several other professional term paper writers for this book. I don't personally accept her work choices, but it is obvious it gave her some valuable insights to the industry and why students cheat. She destroys a lot of the myths about professional term paper companies. For example, Child points out how most people think that cheaters use companies for their term papers because it is convenient or because cheaters are stupid and incapable of doing the work. Then she describes how most students work with term paper companies. She says most students plan in advance and get multiple drafts of the paper, then ask the companies to make corrections until their paper is perfect. She shows how these students are also smart and when they buy a professional-grade term paper it is an investment in their futures. She also spends several chapters describing how law suits and technology won't shut down term paper companies. The chapter on technology is a MUST READ for teachers who think that running students' papers through a machine will catch cheaters.  <br /> <br />The book isn't just about the term paper industry. Even though it is mentioned in every chapter, Child is looking at the bigger picture. I personally liked the section in the chapter on Standardization where she talks about how creativity has no place in the schools. She shows how a creative student is able to see multiple answers to the same question, but when students are standardized, any creative thought is harmful to the students' success because they can rationalize an answer the system says is wrong. Being a free thinker is therefore a liability in schools.  <br /> <br />Child's writing style is sometimes too rawand emotional. It's actually very witty in places but this is dark humor. It is not a book that leaves you with a \\"feel good\\" sensation when you finish it. Even her Conclusion doesn't conclude much of anything. It summarizes her thoughts on education and the term paper industry. Of course, I don't know how qualified a former professional term paper writer is to suggest changes and anyhow she says that the problem is too big for one person to solve. (page 245 --- \\"As our topic is pervasive cheating on a national level, I will not pretend or presume to have recommendations for positive change on the scale needed to achieve true reform.\\") Still I think anyone who has ever been curious about why students cheat, plagiarize, or buy term papers should definitely read this book. This is especially true for frustrated teachers who fight to get cheating out of their classrooms but don't understand why their students still cheat.	2005-10-11

With the identity of her father unknown, a teenage Annunciata heads to the restored court and is quickly enveloped in it's heady atmosphere of love and politics. She is the Scarlet O'Hara of her time, falling in and out of love, marrying in haste, and bearing children with resentment. The search for her father only causes more heartbreak, but Annunciata stands tall and proud through it all. <br />   <br />  This book is packed with people and events, there is never a dull moment. Every member of the family gets a valid storyline, and the time gap from the last book is well accounted for. Once again, the characters are involved in the making of history. The court and fashion of Charles II are brilliantly described. Actual historical figures blend seemlessly with the fictional ones.  <br /> <br />Generations may come and go, but the Morland family remain true to their principles, no matter what the politics of the time.

So beautiful that after he betroths hear to a drover, the local laird secretly plots to have her for himself. But after her bridegroom mysteriously dies on their wedding morning, Edain is banished from her girlhood village amid whispers of witchcraft and murder. <br /> <br />From the moment he spies the lovely young woman in her wedding gown on the mist-shrouded beach, Magnus fitzJulien knows his destiny is sealed. But the passion Magnus and Edain share is filled with danger...and magic. For Edain's Celtic second sight bespeaks distant times and far-off realms. And the aristocratic knight who worships her must challenge a king's might and a word of intrigue and treachery to win her liberty and precious love. <br /> <br />MY POINT OF VIEW: <br /> <br />I am actually shocked at the reviews, and I want to sincerely apologize to those who read the prior reviews and purchased this book as a result, because I too was a victim of such circumstance. I mean this humbly, as I am not an expert writer, but I am an avid reader, so here it goes: I really thought this book was terrible.  <br />I would not go as far as to say I hated this book, as hate is a strong word. Therefore, I would like to call this: <br /> <br />5 reasons why I DISLIKE this book. <br /> <br />1. This book lacks seduction. It fails to seduce the reader. The words do not flow and we are not lured into the plot. There is also no art of seduction between the hero and the heroine. I can even go as far as say that there is absolutely no romance.  This will be more exemplified as you read numbers 2 to 5.  <br /> <br />2. We never get to know the characters in this book. The author is good at visualization, but we have no insight to the type of disposition these characters possess, especially the hero and the heroine. <br /> <br />Aside from the heroine being a seer, she has NO PERSONALITY. All we know about her is that she is very beautiful, has a power to foresee the future that she can't always control. <br />  <br />The hero too, has NO PERSONALITY. He could be a totem pole (no pun intended). It seemed that he only had two roles: sleep with the heroine and rescue her.   <br /> <br />3. I have no idea why these people loved each other.  <br />The first time the hero meets the heroine, she has been abandoned on the beach, and he is asked to transport her. He refuses to, thinking her a concubine of a laird, although he is told otherwise (that she grew up in a convent and she is an innocent). He tries to leave her behind, but the heroine, Edain uses her power to \\"call him\\" via telepathy when he is on his ship, and he turns around. He carries her from the beach and then dumps her on the boat. Whilst on the voyage, she has a vision of him \\"naked\\". This supposedly tells us, the readers, that they are fated to be together.  <br />Now, even though it is destiny, there is no journey in their love story. The hero says barely 5 to 10 lines to her and she, probably about 3 lines to him before they are intimate with each other. He finds out then, that she is a virgin...but does he even say anything to her? - No!  <br />After taking her innocence, they fall asleep and then she gets kidnapped. He wakes up and finds out that she has gone.  <br />This is the initiation of this story's format, which can be summarized by the following 3 distinct step pattern:  <br /> <br />Heroine is in trouble - Hero rescues her - They have an intimate encounter -  <br /> <br />Then the cycle begins again.... <br /> <br />Moreover, I believe that the author assumes that the readers should buy into their love story because of the vision Edain has in the beginning of the book. However, it does not work that way. I do not believe that the characters cherished or valued each other. They never get to know each other, just as we the readers never gain insight towho they are.    <br />  <br />4. Although this book is packed with historical facts, and I would probably give it two thumbs up for accuracy it is absolutely boring.  <br />It is supposedly action packed, but it is not. Just a lot of dumb things happen. (I wish I knew how else to put it). A lot of contradictory and illogical things occur. I shall illustrate: <br /> <br />We have people who torture the heroine. But within 2 minutes she is OK, so we as readers have to rethink whether or not she had been tortured in the first place. <br />An example of this is when she is in the hands of the \\"Templars\\" who administer tests on her to see if she really has some powers, so she calls on Magnus (telepathically) to save her....Then later in the book the author has her thinking that they were not really being mean to her in the first place!!!????? She starts to justify the actions of the Templars.... <br />Another scene, a man who has a twisted love / obsession for her tries to kill her. (The only character with a personality by the way).  <br />He chokes her, to the point that she is bleeding. With her powers, she is able to usurp him. In the next minute, she is fine. <br />She often gets premonitions, or feelings of \\"dread\\" when danger is about to befall her. There is a scene that she sits with King Henry, where she gets this so-called feeling of dread, and does not want to sit with him, but she ends up doing it because she feels forced. Does anything happen after she sits down? No!!! She gives him a prophecy of death....that makes him go mad for a moment.... But that's it! Why did she have the feeling of danger being near in the first place? Why was she afraid? We never know.  <br />The author teases us with the potential for action, but it is never fulfilled.  <br /> <br />5. The hero sleeps around. To me this is a big deal breaker.  He is even \\"pressured\\" into some sort of group encounter...but it is ok, according to the author, because he is thinking of the heroine Edain at the time!!!????   <br />There is a scene when Magnus tells Edain, that he had slept with other people, but it is her that he wanted. And with her \\"power\\" she can tell that he was thinking of her whilst sleeping with others....!!!????? Yuk! Does anyone else not see anything wrong with this scenario? <br /> <br />This book unfortunately, I believe to be abysmal at best. I gave it two stars and not one because of its historical accuracy.  <br />Is this a keeper? - Definitely Not.  <br />Is it worth reading? - No. Pick up a Susan Tanner or a Jude Deveraux instead please.   <br />Is it worth scheming through when you are absolutely bored? - Maybe. <br />	2005-10-11

We read Celebrate!ADHD and then invited Mr. Martin to our home for an in-home consultation and coaching session.<br /><br />I can't begin to describe what a difference this has made in our lives.

Indeed, a very short introduction, with only a minimal evocation of maths background. But there is enough qualitative explanation so that you can understand the broad historical development. From the Caesar Cipher to a Simple Substitution Cipher to a Vigenere Square Cipher. Then, the text goes into modern ideas, all of which involve using computers to encrypt and decrypt. Notably the invention of the public key system. Truly quite different from all that preceded it.<br /><br />There is also a brief foray into quantum computing. Here, it is mostly conceptual; discussing the possible potential, since current implementations are very rudimentary. The text has no mention of man in the middle attacks and how to guard against these. Pity. Because while this is a very hard attack to perform, if it can done, then it is very hard to defend against. One of the promises of quantum computing is that it inherently offers a simple detection, based on quantum interference by the attacker.	2005-10-11

If you are new to eBay, or know someone who would like to get started, the decision is simple: Buy the book. For the beginning to advanced eBay user, this is a very good introductory tutorial and reference. Most advanced users will not have the depth of knowledge in all areas that is available here, so for anyone wanting to become more proficient in using eBay, this book is also highly recommended. <br /> <br />A lay-flat binding lets the reader keep the book open on the desktop for easy reference, and the profusion of screen shots and sidebars for important points are well organized. The beginner can use this book as an introduction to eBay, and the experienced user can find useful tips and techniques that are well worth the modest price.  <br /> <br />The two major parts of the book cover the fundamental yin and yang of eBay activities: Buying and Selling. Each activity is explained from the foundation up, with the how and why of each detail and its importance to the whole clearly explained. Even if your only interest in eBay is to buy, the section on Selling will explain why sellers do certain things and what the concerns are from their side of the transaction--both important insights. <br /> <br />Two additional smaller sections deal with discussion boards and other resources useful to eBay users both on and off the site, and an appendix containing short chapters on Where To Learn More, HTML, and Other Auction Sites. <br /> <br />One interesting feature of this and other O'Reilly books is a code that gives the buyer access to the online edition free for 45 days. If you're going to be traveling, you can leave the book at home and download some chapters to read. <br /> <br />Since eBay is constantly changing, it presents a moving target, so one hopes that this first effort will be kept current with future releases. If they do, some of the weaker areas can be improved, too. Information on fees is sketchy in several areas, most particularly the eBay Stores section, which needs more depth across the board. Likewise, PayPal needs more than a few pages. And although the Appendix on HTML might be useful for beginners, it should be omitted in favor of URL's to some of the excellent online tutorials, freeing up the pages for a larger index and a glossary instead. eBay is heavy with jargon, and terms like phish, NARU, and pink slap should be easy for the beginner to find.	2005-10-11

Again and again and again there have been books written by writers, homosexuals themselves, (Errol Flynn was \\"outed\\" when he was never \\"in\\", which is so absurd it is verging on insanity; he was also alleged to have been a Nazi spy...I mean, come ON), to make the case for various famous people that are, according to their \\"inside\\" gossip, homosexual. (Not that there's anything wrong with that!)<br /><br />What is left out of this particular novel is the fact that many, many social situations of the day could be taken by today's far more cynical standards, as signs of homosexuality, when, in fact, there is none. Lincoln had a deep affectionate relationship with his wife, but there was much friction also due to Mary's mental fragility and frequent outbursts; on more than one occasion she physically abused Lincoln, which he tolerated with a resignation borne of his love for her between her \\"episodes\\" and an understanding that she loved him deeply; he was the center of her world. Men could be affectionate toward one another then without fear of reprisal or salacious rumor. People were more open and honest in their relationships with each other (esp men with men) because there were no smirking gossipmongers around to invent defammatory stories about them. There was no prohibition of genuine emotion; it was a gentler, more affectionate and generally more accepting time (and men could be affectionate with each other without fear of this emotion being misunderstood) when people could behave in ways that, taken in the context of modern times, would be outrageous and something to seize on and point out as an abberration.<br /><br />Novels of the time frequently had very strong emotional dialogue between friends of the same sex, and in those days, that was the norm. Today, in our harsher moral climate, despite prostestions to the contrary, these behaviors would come under heavy fire and provide fodder for those with a thirst more for the prurient than the factual.<br /><br />Sad comment on what is widely regarded as a more progressive, understanding and intelligent time in our history, and is actually far less ideal than we would want to believe.<br /><br />So, despite the apparent research that went on to put forth this \\"revelation\\" the book reveals more about the writer's personal agenda than it does Lincoln's past relationships with men. If you want to read it, fine, but put it away on the shelf as fiction and don't put too much blind faith in what can only be described as fantasy in the guise of fact.for the prurient than the factual. <br />Sad comment on what is widely regarded as a more progressive, understanding and intelligent time in our history, and is actually far less ideal than we would want to believe. <br />So, despite the apparent research that went on to put forth this \\"revelation\\" the book reveals more about the writer's personal agenda than it does Lincoln's past relationships with men.

The obsessive compulsive focus on headlines and age of death add a nice touch, and the insider perspective on the newspaper business blended with a great narrative about the sleazier side of the music biz made this a wonderful read.  <br /> <br />I had to look up Hiaasen after this to find more and wasn't surprised to find he does work at a Florida newspaper and has done investigative work. It didn't surprise me much to find that he works with and is a friend of Dave Barry. In his own way I think he's funnier and also covering more serious moral ground. <br /> <br />I'm a big fan of Elmore Leonard and the comparison between him and Hiassen is sometimes obvious but Hiassen does a much better job of character background with obscure trivia and is a lot funnier. What I think I like the most is his dark humor.  <br /> <br />I've seen references to Hiaasen's comedic timing as the key to his work and I'd have to agree. He leaves you hanging at just the right point then comes back around to sew up loose threads with a zing much the way an episode of Seinfeld or Curb Your Enthusiasm does. <br /> <br />I'm noticing a lot of redundant themes in his books (Florida developers, eco saviours, blundering crooks, newspaper guys who are more like cops than the cops are) but so far they remain fresh from book to book with little details and distinct plot lines and arcs that make Hiaasen my favorite author.  <br /> <br />There's clearly an auto-biographical element in many of these books, and this one in particular seems likely to draw on that. His web site notes that \\"Since 1985 Hiaasen has been writing a regular column, which at one time or another has pissed off just about everybody in South Florida, including his own bosses.\\" Apparently a lot of the inspiration for his works come from real life stories in the Florida news. I'm ready to order one of his books of his old news columns to get a better sense of that side of him too.  <br /> <br />Jimmy Buffett has picked up options for film rights on one book and Mike Nichols is working on another. I'm hoping this one gets picked up and makes it to the screen someday. Somebody send a copy of Basket Case to Quentin Tarantino, he could have a lot of fun with this one.	2005-10-11

In the decades following the crucifixion of Christ all manner and forms of Christian belief and worship flourished in the eastern part of the Roman empire.  The author describes a number of these movements and philosophies and their writings. Some were Jewish and followed Jewish law, such as the Ebionotes; some were anti-Jewish and rejected Jewish law, such as the Marcionites; some were diverse and deeply-philosophical such as the Gnostics.  The proponents of each produced their written propaganda, often self-serving accounts of Jesus's supposed teachings or accounts of Jesus supposedly authored by one or another of his disciples.      Ehrman sorts out the forgeries and tells what we know of the literature that wasn't deemed worthy of being included in the New Testament by the \\"proto-orthodox\\" Church leaders.  He tells a fascinating tale of a possible modern day forgery by a biblical scholar alongside an ancient forgery of the \\"Gospel of Thomas.\\"  He devotes two chapters to the Gnostics, a movement which can resonate today with the sophistication of their thought.  Unfortunately, many of the early Christian writings have been lost so only a fragmentary description of them and the sects they represented is possible.  One suspects, however, that early Christianity was as diverse as it is today, encompassing as it does everything from snake charmers to Papal pomp.           \\"Lost Christianities\\" is written in a lively style that is comprehensible to the non-specialist (me!).  Like sausage making, the making of the New Testament was not always a admirable blend of choice ingredients.  Non-believers could conclude that it was arbitrary and accidental; believers would see the hidden hand of God winnowing the worthy from the unworthy in creating the world religion of Christianity. The highest praise I can give a book is that it inspired me to explore the subject more deeply and \\"Lost Christianities\\" has done that.      Smallchief	2005-10-11

I could really relate to this book, because like Lee, I was often a loner in highschool.  Also, I went to a very small, private school for college and many of the issues that she dealt with in high school, I dealt with in college.<br /><br />The book starts out during Lee's first few weeks at Ault.  As the novel progresses, we see Lee change and grow as she experiences more and more of Ault's culture.  The book centers around her obsession with Cross Sugarman, a popular basketball player in her grade.  She first meets Cross her freshman year and it at this point that her obsession starts.  The rest of the novel describe's both Lee's triumphs and disappoints that she must deal with in her \\"relationship\\" with Cross Sugarman.<br /><br />The story accumulates Lee's senior year when her whole world comes tumbling down around her including her feelings for Cross.  It is both painful and difficult to see Lee in the position she is in, but it also a triumph to see what she does within her situation.<br /><br />My only regret with the book is that we do not really get to see what happens to Lee after she leaves Ault.  I'm curious to see how her college years turn out and what happens to her as she continues to grow and deepen in her relationship with herself.	2005-10-11

I love Dr. Sears and practiced attachement parenting for the first 6 months. Our son slept with us in our bed for 6 months. At the end of the 6 months we had to go to bed with him at 7pm since this he could not sleep in his crib. We had practiced attachment parenting (Sears) and this is what he had learned to expect. He could only sleep in bed with us next to him. Add to this that my baby could only sleep with us and ate 80% of his milk during night time. So not only were we in bed with him by 7pm, but also feeding him all night long. When the morning rolled in, my husband and I felt like zombies. We were exhausted and fighting with each other all the time due to the stress and exhaustion. <br /> <br />I was then recommended Ferber. I was terrified as I had heard horrible things and I do not believe in Crying it out. Howeverm I had already tried the No cry sleep solution and this did not work for us. So I gave Ferber the benefit of the doubt and decided to read his book. I focused on chptrs 5 and 6. <br /> <br />First, you do NOT need to let your baby cry it out. Ferber explains it very clearly in his book. He suggests a timetable, but leaves it up to the parents to change the suggested minutes on the table to meet the baby and parents' needs. For example, he suggest to let the baby cry for 5 min and increase gradually, but that the parent can change this to any minute they wish. I would only let my baby cry 1 min at a time and would them run into his room and confort him for 3 min. I am not sure how the previous readers would be considered detachment parenting!!!! <br /> <br />I did this for 2 nights. After two nights my baby was sleeping through the night.  <br /> <br />In order to correct his night feeding, we gradually reduced his night intake. Ferber suggests doing this over a week. Since I did not want my baby crying, I implemented his program over a 4 week period. During these 28 days, my baby cried once!!! I know can sleept through the night and so can my family. We all wake up rested and ready for another day. My husband and I are no longer exhausted nor fighting due to exhaustion. <br /> <br />In conclusion, give this book an opportunity. Remember, you can tailor his program so it is as gentle as you wish. I believe that the people that are giving this book a bad review is because they chose to let their baby cry all night long, did not modify the program/timetable and truly this is unacceptable!	2005-10-11

It not only lists and describes the various campgrounds around the state (including maps of the campsites themselves), but it also includes checklists and tips that are very useful for the camping neophyte.  <br /> <br />The only criticisms I have of the book is that it lacks photographs  of the sites discussed (maps only), and, perhaps more importantly, has a rather cumbersome to use state campsites map. The map shows all the sites discussed in the book and has them indicated by number. To find out what the sites are, you have to flip back a page to find out the name. Unfortunately, page numbers are not provided on that page; instead, you have to then go to the index and look up the site by name and then flip to the section of the book where the site is discussed. It would be much more useful to provide page numbers on the map key and to provide the map number on the title page for each site discussed.  <br /> <br />Minor points, I suppose, but no reason for things to be laid out that way. Still, I give it a strong recommendation.	2005-10-11

Having read, re-read, and re-read Wicked time and time again, I became ecstatic to learn there was a sequel being published. However, it was sheer curiosity more than anything which led me to Son of a Witch, and the resulting read was at once satisfying and disappointing, if such a thing is possible. <br /> <br />Son of a Witch begins with an intriguing premise and moves along at a pace more visibly urgent than Wicked's. For those readers of Wicked who became infatuated with Maguire's vision of Oz, which differs from Baum's largely in complexity and mood, this is an ideal read: less character-driven than its predecessor, it is much more about the world itself than any of the leading characters. It's worth it just for that. I sped through the book in just over a day and thoroughly enjoyed myself the whole time. <br /> <br />Yet, in the end, it raises even more questions than the original Wicked did. Ends which were dangled before us close to the beginning of the novel are never tied up, and even more strings become visible as the inevitable conclusion approaches. The ending of the book may be done well enough, but as soon as I put it down, the first thought in my mind was \\"Well, what about...?\\" <br /> <br />By all means, pick it up, buy it even, as it's yet one more example of Maguire's fine writing, but don't expect another Wicked. Son of a Witch is a different, intriguing if flawed, creature altogether... and doesn't let the reader forget that easily.	2005-10-11

I bought it immediately, but refrained from reading it until I finally, after years of searching, found all three available at a used book store in West Los Angeles ten years later.  The Orphan, the first book, still haunts me in a BEAUTIFUL way.  I was 12 when I began reading it, enduring chicken pocks in the early spring.  My health condition may have intensified my feelings as I read the book as well as the early stages of my own growing puberty and sexuality. I found the graphic content and deep descriptions very disturbing, often arousing and exciting and I could well relate to the character, Charles, that the Beast incorporates in the second half of the book.  I thought I may never find out more about this book and the author, nor another soul who had read it, but I was certain that whoever had would be affected deeply by it.  It is a story full of passion, whimsy at times, and searching.  Well, I loved it and would love to meet or speak with the author one day.

She masquerade as a man, runs a pirate ship, and order a tided up Ryan put in her cabin.  Run away from Ryan to Madagascar and have a sexy Irish lover, Sean Rafferty.  Got toss in a harem and still manages to spring free.  She goes on so many adventures and places just to get away from Ryan. I would describe Cat as a smart woman but she falls for Ryan and that is debatable.<br /><br />From the beginning of the book, I really hated Ryan Nicholls because he raped Cat. When the book ends, I hated him even more because of his infidelity.  I find that I liked Cat's lover, Sean, better and wish he was the hero of the story. Sean is fun, relax, and cool and he has a good sense of humor and knows how to play games despite one flaw. Also, he understands no means no.  I still don't understand why Cat loves Ryan.  The guy is extremely stubborn, cheats on the heroine many time, tortured her, verbally abusive to her, etc... the list goes on.  Bewared, some rape scenes are in the book.<br /><br />I have never read a romance novel where the hero and heroine both sleep with other people after they have known each other.  In a way it is refreshing and makes me upset at the same time. It's definitely one of those book that stays on my mind for years to come.<br /><br />I recommend this book for it is unique, memorable, fast pace, and full of adventure.

I am happy with the career change I've now made (from consulting into non-profit management), but I will be buying more copies of this book as gifts for friends in the midst of mid-life career decisions.	2005-10-11

I counted no less than five, inexcusable for a well-known publishing house. On the other hand, the memoir itself is beautifully written. Particularly poignant is the inability of the author and her husband to confront his impending death together, keeping them from gaining the intimacy she needed to feel in her marriage. I thought her devotion and attention to her husband was an inspiration, especially since their entire married life they played host to an unwanted guest: cancer. As for critics who say she violated the Kennedy's \\"cone of silence\\" I would respond: get over it!  The Kennedys chose public life and have certainly used their name when it suited them. I suspect she could have written a great deal more about them had she chosen to. The Kennedys and Radziwills are lucky to have such a talented, compassionate member in their midst.	2005-10-11

I have several ('Modern Chess Miniatures' by Barden and Heidenfeld, 'The Art of Chess' by Mason, 'Chess for Fun and Chess for Blood' by Lasker, and this text) in my collection.<br /><br />Abrahams was a barrister in England, whose avocation was chess (he published several books on chess as well as law).  This book is not really for the absolute beginner, but for those who have developed some knowledge of the basic movements, some love for the game, and are interested in bettering their strategy for more competitive play.  'Primarily this collection of examples of methods of play is designed to help the novice.'<br /><br />Gerald Abrahams (1907-1980) was a very strong amateur who was playing master-level chess by the 1930s. He is credited with the invention of a variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined Semi-Slav Defence, known as the Abrahams-Noteboom variation. He scored highly in several major tournaments, including one in Nottingham in 1936, and in an Anglo-Soviet game on the radio in 1946.<br /><br />Abrahams uses a lot of endgame examples, for as he states, this is where the particular functions of pieces can be isolated and examined in more detail.  However, he also uses a lot of earlier game and full-game examples, before specific advantages have been solidified in the play.<br /><br />Abrahams likens the discovery of strategy and technique in chess to the discovery of prose by Moliere's M. Jourdain - when he was taught prose, he discovered that he had speaking in prose all his life.  Many chess players already have some basic strategies, tactics and ideas.  Abrahams describes these as being the rules beyond the rules - those conventions by which a game is played beyond the regular rules of play.<br /><br />This is a fun book to read.  Abrahams' style of writing is witty ('Much of chess is in the nature of petty larceny, to say nothing of catching bargains, and the picking up of unconsidered trifles').  It does take some dedication, as the examples are full and this is intended as a practical rather than a philosophical guide to chess playing.  The reader who masters this text will improve his or her game, and be better prepared for the various situations that arise on the chessboard.of catching bargains, and the picking up of unconsidered trifles').

For those considering buying this book, I will be as honest as they come. I have a few alias book both from version 6 & 7 & iv read reviews from those who bought such books. Some good, some not so good. Let me start out to say, those who write books have something to share, they take the time, interest to share there years of skill. Those who read books complain, there exspectations are way to high so high they become disapointed. Take a look at the contents of this book then ask yourself if this is where you are in Maya.In any stage of life we must be ready to explore its wonders. This book starts off where the foundation closses. Here you will learn advance stages & yes if your not ready to journey such gravel then step back & choose a more simply path so you may come back to this road when you you are ready. Learning about Parameterization for example is a must for building any model, these patches must match for seemless rendering so yes! learning such advance skill is a must. Knowing how to work with tessellation is also a plus for any successful modeling & I think this book covers such. Maya must convert to pologonal when rendering, this is where tessellation comes into to play so yes! learning such is a must. Would I buy this book ? Sure I would if I needed to learn such skills  & if I was ready. Those that complain that this book is to hard to follow is just not ready. My advice is to use what you learn in the foundation book & then when the time is right, when you feel its time to take maya to the next level, feel free to explore this book. Modeling like anything, its a skill, you may have the blue prints to build the house, you may have the hammer & nails but without skill, a plan is just a plan. Good luck.	2005-10-11

Just take a look at Michael Pateson's unique Winston Churchill: Personal Accounts Of The Great Leader At War to see the difference. For one thing, comments Churchill made about himself have been paired with previously unpublished, firsthand accounts of those who knew him to provide plenty of detail on Churchill's military background and how it changed his life and perceptions. Paterson adds the recollections of Churchill's superiors, fellow officers, and more to provide fresh material which is not covered in other books. Secondly, Winston Churchill follows a chronological order focusing on his military campaigns, which provides the ability to appreciate the changes in Churchill's strategic thinking over the decades. Finally, Winston Churchill provides plenty of technical references for further study, making it one of the most detailed biographies about Churchill in print. Very highly recommended.	2005-10-11

That these events occur before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor should be used to remind students that the war did not begin in December of 1941 but rather that the horrors that would involve America had been ongoing for several years and possibly had already been decided.<br /><br />Additionally, the events of 1940 and the summer of 1941 in all likliehood sealed the fate of the Reich.<br /><br />This could well be read in conjunction with Antony Beevor's extraordinary \\"Stalingrad: The Fateful Siege,\\" also detailing these preliminary events.<br /><br />The gamble by Stalin to procrastinate the building of the defensive fortifications after the old ones were torn down is given much analysis here. Nevertheless it is difficult to imagine the gamble being less in its result than Hitler's loss of interest in conquering GB and pursuing the eastern front. Perhaps if there is any justice in such horror it is that both countries and their Armies were virtual anarchies directed by imbalenced men with no checks and balances on their decisions. When disagreement equates to death, leaders recieve a lot of \\"yes men\\" of all ranks.<br /><br />Extremely well done: worth reading. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury	2005-10-11

Its storyline was very straightforward with few tangential plots and their accompanying detail. After recently reading a couple books with much more convoluted (though equally enjoyable) plots, this book was an easy read. The timing was perfect as well. With the real world fearing the possibility of an avian flu pandemic again this year, that plot line gave the story a real-time feel.<br /><br />Contract agent (assassin) Liliane Mansfield, aka Denise Morel, takes out bad guy Salvatore Nervi in Paris for killing her best friends and \\"their\\" thirteen-year-old daughter, Zia. Because doing so means she's \\"left the reservation\\" to carry out a personal vendetta, she needs to be stopped. It also seems Nervi served a certain purpose in American clandestine affairs, and rubbing him out was a no-no. Enter handsome, swarthy, and earthy agent Lucas Swain. Swain is sent to Paris to hunt Lily down and to do the deed. However, the plot thickens as Lily wonders why her retired agent friends, Averill and Tina Joubrans, would take a job that put at risk the new life they'd created-a job that led to their deaths. Lily, determined to find the answer, remains in Paris at great risk to herself.<br /><br />Swain and Lily meet during a nasty shoot-out and, rather than put her down when he had the chance, Swain saves her and is immediately drawn to her intensity and bravery. (Well, her being good-looking helped, too.) They develop a bond, of sorts, out of circumstance and necessity. Their relationship grows and complicates things some, but it also brings about the opportunity to do in some really bad dudes if they work together. When they find out what was really behind the Joubrans mission, they know what they must do.<br /><br />Howard's writing is clear and her story easy to follow. There are some plot twists near the end, which make for good storytelling; but, for the most part, the story is about Lucas Swain, Lily Mansfield, and saving the world. However, one question remains throughout the book: Will Lucas kill Lily in the end?<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hills throughout the book: Will Lucas kill Lily in the end?    Carolyn Rowe Hill	2005-10-11

For many years I refused to read this book because I did not want to blot or tarnish, with content that had been repeatedly described as putrid, hostile, slanderous, character-damaging dreck, my image of John Lennon. After finding a hardcover in mint condition for only five bucks, however, I couldn't resist, and I'm glad I buckled.  First off, like me, anyone wanting to read the book probably loves John so much that nothing anyone could ever say about him would really sully or ruin their affection for the man.  Secondly, I realized quickly why Yoko Ono had so fervently condemned this book as I reached the second half.  Overall, Goldman says nothing horribly negative about John (yes, he's described as neurotic and slightly crazy, but didn't we always know that about John, and wasn't that part of his appeal?)  The person Goldman painstakingly describes as evil is Yoko.  She comes across as satanic in nature, and while I was initially hesitant to accept this harsh assessment of her, too many other books, such as Pete Shotton's and Tony Bramwell's, paint a similar portrait for Goldman to be completely wrong.  For instance, Goldman is the only writer to reveal that no record exists of the phone calls Yoko Ono famously and dramatically claims to have made to Paul and Mimi the night John died.  An abundance of facts of this nature are to be found in the book.      That said, I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and I recommend you read it.  The experience made me realize that my love for John is impenetrable, and if yours is too, then I recommend you check this book out.  Ask yourself, who is the person who has done the most campaigning to destroy this book?  The answer is the woman about whom Goldman does a good deal to expose.        (As a final asterisk, I meant to only give this a four star review, but I edited the review so many times that I ultimately hit the wrong button)	2005-10-11

The way corporates do governance is linked to the political makeup of their home countries, argues Peter Gourevitch and James Shinn in their important new book. Practices can't be imposed successfully from the outside or homogenized to some global standard; they bubble up from politics and pressures on the ground. Gourevitch, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego and Shinn, ex-CEO of Dialogic and now visiting professor at Georgetown University, uncover complex relationships between key market players. Are workers and investors natural allies, for instance? Well, in markets where job protection laws are widespread, safeguards for investors are weak. On the other hand, global capital moves like a magnet to companies and markets that feature the most minority shareowner protection-thus creating jobs. Read this to find the web of ties to political power that promises global diversity in governance practices for years to come.	2005-10-11

In short, I believe that I've managed to pick up quite a bit of information within a relatively short time. Nevertheless, I gained an incredible amount of knowledge by reading this book by Thomas Woll. <br /> <br />First, it's written in a very clear and easy-to-read manner. So many non-ficiton books make for very dry reading, or use such heavy language that you struggle to understand what they're actually say, or use an annoying overly-chatty style (at least that's the case in some of the publishing books I've read). The writing here flows so well that this is one of the few non-fiction books that I literally devoured - and went back to read again, and then yet again, without getting bored or feeling the desperate need to take a break after a short time. <br /> <br />Second, the information in the book is incredibly useful and important. For me, just the first four chapters would have been enough, and more than worth the price of the entire book. Yes, I know about cash flow and creating a budget, but the clear way that Woll presents the subject, and the fact that it's all geared towards publishers' needs, gave me a whole new perspective on things. As a matter of fact, I've already redone my budget and publishing plan for the next three years based on his advice! <br /> <br />The chapter on management was also extremely useful to me. Many of the other chapters were not applicable to me at this stage of the game (being a small one and a half person publisher outside the U.S.), but they will surely be of interest to anyone building up his publishing business beyond one or two titles. <br /> <br />In short, if you are serious about publishing, this book is a MUST for your library. It will help clarify all of those nasty money issues that no one wants to think about while they are pursuing their dreams of publishing the next great bestseller, and teach you how you can do that while keeping an eye on the bottom line. Highly recommended.   <br />	2005-10-11

Something about the word \\"truffler\\" just does it to me.  Anyhoo...<br /><br />Sobin has an obvious love of words that is apparent from the get go.  Though a thin book, this is a very slowly paced thin book, allowing for mountains of description to be heaped on: memories, the lazy days of spring and summer, and Cabassac's vivid dreams of his dead wife.  The Fly-Truffler is an ode to language and linguistics--as much of the plot and descriptions revolve around Cabassac's interest in the fading dialect of the Provencal hills.  Whether or not that's your cup of tea is entirely your call.  I personally enjoy words, so I didn't mind reading it, but the pacing was very heavy and at times trying.  This isn't a particularly happy wook and it continues to gain weight right through to the end.  There's a nihilistic quality to it.  Cabassac's interest is in joining his dead wife in the vivid dreams that the local truffles provide him.  As he becomes more and more entrenched and drawn to this etherworld, his reality gets more and more depressing--he neglects his teaching, then his job, and finally...  Not exactly life re-affirming.<br /><br />Had the pacing or the use of words been a little tighter, I think I would have given it a higher rating.  However, there was much repetition that did not seem intentional, and ended up feeling slightly sloppy and self-indulgent.  Kind of like a depressive's poems or song lyrics.  And unfortunately, though we can feel and empathize with Cabassac's pain, neither he nor his wife are quite dynamic enough to make the sad journey seem worthwhile.	2005-10-11

I first read Eragon right after finishing LOTR- big mistake.  Pretty predictable plot, and not nearly as well-written, I was cursing Paolini when I first started reading it- but in the end I really enjoyed Eragon for what it was, nonetheless.  I was really looking forward to the sequel, Eldest, and was ecstatic when it came out. <br /> <br />Now I don't want start off wrong here- I've read other reviewers' comments, and I think Paolini and Eldest are getting a pretty bad rap- the book wasn't THAT bad.  You want really bad fantasy- read \\"Dragonspell\\" by Donita K. Paul (I still shudder when I think about that book, it was so awful).  I actually finished Eldest anticipating the third one, so that's a good sign.  Still, a few valid points were definitely made: <br /> <br />1) Mixture of LOTR and other fantasy classics- this is definitely true.  But hey, you gotta start out somewhere, right? <br /> <br />2) Forced vocabulary- most blatant of all, if you ask me.  This book is an EXCELLENT resource if you are studying for the GRE, because I swear, there are SO MANY words here from the Princeton Review GRE study guide.  You might say \\"Oh well, he's just utilizing more of the English language; tough cookies if you can't understand it because your vocabulary is limited.\\"  I might be inclined to agree with you if he didn't use so many together- but 50-60 words that I've only seen on that GRE vocabulary list alone (and I consider myself pretty well-read)?  Come on.  If he did purposefully pull words out of the Princeton Review vocabulary list, then that's fine, but he used them in such a way that it just seemed forced many times- I mean come on, who uses the word \\"chary\\" in place of \\"wary\\" or \\"cautious\\"?  Just say \\"wary\\"! <br /> <br />3) First part of the book is boring- man, do I agree with that one.  I'd venture that the first 75% of the book was pretty much boring- it only got really good towards the end.  It usually takes me between 3-10 days to finish a book, depending on how good it is.  It took me a month to finish Eldest, because it was so hard to stay interested.  One reviewer said if you can make past the first 2/3 of the book, you'll be good.  Change 2/3 to 3/4, and I'll agree. <br /> <br />4) Way too long- definitely.  I don't mind a long book if it's content is good.  But so much could have been cut out- many lengthy descriptions of things that didn't need describing weren't valuable to readers like me. <br /> <br />5) Eragon evolves too much in one year- yes!  I mean, we go from a 15-year-old farmer kid who didn't know squat, to a 16-year-old who is able to make political decisions on his own?  I mean, by the end of it, Eragon is speaking like a man in his mid-40s.  I know that he has been through a lot, but the change is a little bit much. <br /> <br />6) I'm going to add one here- Roran's plot.  A nice attempt, but this man suggests way too many crazy schemes, which is fine- but my problem is that the whole village follows him EVERY SINGLE TIME.  To me, that is just not realistic.  Period. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, it's a decent read, and Paolini has talent, although not yet fully-developed.  I understand that it is the second in a trilogy, and as seconds go, it is not going to be the most exciting read, as it is just a preparation for the last book.  Now if Paolini blows the last book, I'm going to have to recant my statements.	2005-10-11

If there are any young people out there who don't know how they'd respond if ever a draft were reintroduced, now is the time to arm oneself with knowledge.    Set in the same location where F. Scott Fitzgerald's great literary work The Great Gatsby took place many years earlier, Jerry Elmer's new non-fiction book, Felon for Peace, has successfully portrayed life in the 1960s and 70s in Great Neck, a highly-educated Long Island community, during the rise of America's War Resistance Movement.[...]. Of course, Felon for Peace goes well beyond Elmer's coming-of-age story in Great Neck, and moves on to the national scene.    Perhaps the book's greatest strength is that it poses the ethical questions of the time in a sophisticated way that challenges the readers of today. At the same time, Elmer is self-deprecating and draws the reader in, right from his elementary school days at the Kensington-Johnson School, through his days at Great Neck South High School and well beyond.    Felon for Peace could be a great resource in teaching the history of the Vietnam War era; it reveals with clarity what was happening on the larger domestic front at that time. In addition, the book could provoke interesting class discussions for student teachers, who are planning to teach high school; the book gives an excellent sense of the capabilities of motivated and highly intelligent high school students. I recommend it as an animated discussion-starter for over-50s book clubs as well. Felon for Peace is an excellent read.	2005-10-11

Or maybe I've just gotten cynical. However, there is a surplus of sociopaths, violent psychopaths, and generally sick puppies.<br /><br />Kudos, and 4 stars, to author Jeff Lindsay for creating in DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER a most unlikely hero, or at least protagonist, in Dexter Morgan, a blood splatter expert for the Miami Police Department, who's also a serial killer exercising his own brand of vigilantism. His victims - 37 to date - are those that society would perhaps like to see dead anyway, e.g. pedophile priests, child rapists, and at least one \\"mercy killer\\" RN. Dexter's modus operandi is to vivisection them to death. Nice.<br /><br />Here, Dexter is faced with a serial murderer of prostitutes whose method mimics his own. Morgan is torn between helping his foster sister, a Miami PD vice officer, catch the monster to jump start her stalled career and bonding with somebody who's obviously a soulmate. Wouldn't it be nice to work on some poor unfortunate together?<br /><br />In a world bereft hero figures, I'm left to seek them in fiction. Despite Lindsay's inventiveness, I don't see why I should have to adopt one whose elimination from the human gene pool would be so desirable. So, four stars to DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER notwithstanding, I don't intend to continue with the series.	2005-10-11

Neither was a sovereign ruler but both had personalities of strength and authority. Emma (Ælfgifu after her marriage), sister of Duke Richard II of Normandy (though she carried a Frankish birth-name), was the queen first of Æthelred \\"the Redeless,\\" Saxon King of England, and then of Canute, the Danish conqueror of the island. Edith, daughter of Godwine, Earl of Wessex, furthered her family's dynastic ambitions by becoming the queen of King Edward the Confessor, and thereby Emma's daughter-in-law. But this volume is considerably more than a dual biography, and more even than the \\"gender study\\" it intends to be. It delves deeply into the dynastic power structures of  11th century ruling families and the nature of royal patronage which helped keep rulers in power. The prosopographical appendix and the extensive bibliography also are excellent.	2005-10-11

US	38468364	RD20KADYKPCXM	0553481681	628361890	Superman: Doomsday and Beyond	Books	3	3	4	N	N	Weak Adaptation	This is a novelization of the comic books that dealt with Superman's death and eventual return back in the early 1990s. The author, Louise Simonson, also worked on some of the comic books. It was a big event, even getting coverage by the mainstream media. Unfortunately, there's little sense of that epic feeling here. Novelizations are supposed to expand on the original material and offer additional insights, but Ms. Simonson tries to adapt 40 issues of comic book material in too short a space. The official page count is 190. However, 9 of those pages are used to give a skimpy, chopped-up novelization of the 6-issue \\"Man of Steel\\" miniseries that gave us Superman's definitive (until \\"Birthright\\") origin in 1986, 10 of those pages go to black-and-white reproductions of artwork from the comic books, and 6 of those pages are completely blank. That means that Simonson tried to adapt, I believe, 880 pages of comic books into 165 pages of prose. It doesn't work very well. Now, this might not have been her fault. DC Comics or Bantam Books might have dictated it. Still, I'm going to give my opinions of what's wrong here and how it could have been done better. First of all, the prologue was unnecessary. When this book was published in 1993, \\"The Adventures of Superboy\\" had recently ended, and \\"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman\\" had recently started. There were enough references to Superman's past in both series - plus \\"Superman: The Movie\\" was available on home video - to pretty much guarantee that anyone that would pick up this book would be familiar with Superman's origin. Even if it differed somewhat from the comic books, so what? The basic story is still the same: Clark Kent was raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent in Smallville and grew up to become Superman. You don't need to take up 9 pages for that. Besides, you get as much in the main story, anyway. Second, the full-page illustrations weren't needed. This is a prose adaptation. If I wanted to see the pictures, I'd read the comic books or trade paperback collections. There's a nice, 2-page, headshot gallery of the main characters before the story begins, so everyone will know what they look like. We don't need the full-page illustrations for that. Third, the blank pages are the biggest waste of all. They seem to be there for no reason other than to make sure that each chapter starts on an odd-numbered page. There are also 4 blank pages after the story ends and a full-page illustration before the prologue. These 30 pages could have been used to flesh out the story a little more. For example, the author often gives us an expository account of a conversation instead of giving us all of the dialogue. This is a pretty good indication that she was trying to crunch the story down to make it fit in 165 pages. Fourth, the font size is too big. If it was a little smaller, she could have fit more story into the book. Maybe they intentionally used a large font size to make the story seem longer than it really is. Who knows? I saw this book and got it used just for Supergirl, because I'm a Supergirl fanatic. I admit that I like her full-page, black-and-white illustration on page 65. Anyway, if you find this book cheap, go ahead and pick it up. It's an okay diversion for a few hours.	2005-10-11

It's very easy to master as it's based on a concept you and they can relate to = 3 strikes, you're out!

Unfortunately (and, again, just like Europe 101) Rick can't stick to the subject of travel.  He just can't seem to stop himself from trying to sneak in a little political proselytizing. <br /> <br />But let's start with the parts of this book that make it worth the cover price.  This is not your typical travel book--where to go, what to see, hotel and restaurant ratings, and that sort of thing.  No, this is more like an introduction to HOW to travel.  It teaches you how to travel in a way that gives you full value for your money and maximum enjoyment for your time. <br /> <br />In that regard, the book is excellent.  It is one that I would recommend to anyone who wants to travel, anywhere, at anytime in their life.  It covers things like how to plan an itinerary, how to pack, how to make your own travel arrangements, and how to avoid getting ripped-off. <br /> <br />When he sticks to these kinds of subjects Rick is a great travel writer.  But, as I said, he just can't help himself.  Halfway through the book he has to try to shove a bit of his politics down our throats.  When he suddenly started complaining about the problems with the American way of doing things, and waxing poetic about how much better the European governments work, I found myself wondering, \\"So, why don't you make Europe your permanent home?\\" <br /> <br />And then I remembered.  He's making a FORTUNE selling these travel books, all the while telling Americans how crass and materialistic they are.  Hmmm.  Does the word \\"irony\\" come to mind? <br /> <br />Anyway, as I said, this is a good book that could have been great.  It is good because of the useful travel information that Rick is able to provide.  It misses great only because he doesn't seem to understand that his personal politics are not what a reader wants from a book like this one.  Maybe one day Rick will get the message, or an editor who is willing to stand up to him and say \\"this passage does not belong in a travel book and I'm cutting it out!\\"  In the meantime his books are worth reading, but only just.	2005-10-11

Almost uniformly the critics seem to read as live people I have met who are Christians who become quite shrill when certain newer historical concepts are mentioned or written about.  But in the interest of my own satisfaction, I went back and researched a few of the cheif complaints. <br /> <br />It turns out that many of the criticism repeated over and over are nothing more than petty objections to historically controversial \\"facts\\" that historians have debated for a long time.  The existence of Nazareth is one example.  Yes, you can find it on maps of the first century period because their is much assumption that it existed then.  But the town is not mentioned in the Hebrew texts, not in Josephus, nor in the Talmud.  Jerome in the 5th century says that it was a vicilus or mere village of perhaps a couple hundred people.  It was a satellite of the larger city of Sepphoris four miles away.  To add to that, the respected historian Zindler argued as did many others, that Nazareth did not exist in the first century. He cites Paul, Josephus, the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud as well as the statement that the brow of the hill near Nazareth is not steep enough for someone to be thrown off and killed, referring to Luke 4:28-30.  Add to all this the very diverse historical evidence of an active Nasoean sect and the Ebionites who seemed to be the real source of Jewish \\"Christianity\\" - rejected by the Paulinians and you have just the beginning of what is really an much more complex historical setting than just saying one thing or another and sticking to it for two thousand years.  A deep study of early Christianity or a good reading of Gibbons classic history \\"Fall the of the Roman Empire\\" will lend more support than not to \\"The Hiram Key.\\" <br /> <br />It is my guess that what irritates most people aside from those who react as true-believing modern Christians, is the writing style of the two authors.  That and the lack of a Bibliography.  Certainly, Knight and Lomas have noticed that error and their subsequent books have very long Bibliographies.  But the writing style is casual, and people used to reading solid historical works are made to feel that they are being taken on a fantasy ride, however plausable the narrative manages to make itself.  And that rise and falls throughpout the book.  The two slimest sequences are the story of the murder of Hiram Abif and the story of the mock crucifixion of Jaques de Molay.   <br /> <br />But the reader must understand that the book has been written by those and for those who are very familiar with the traditional history of Freemasonry.  Knowing it as well as I did, I could see how this could be an explanation.  Time perhaps will add or detract from their theory.  The story of Jaques de Molay was very rich because it was written almost as a play might have been written.  But it does appear that the victim was nailed to a door and the door slamed over and over.  This was not an unusual torment during that period, and if you have traveled in Europe and visited a few dungeons, you will find that this was not the most inventive torture that was invented by apparently horribly bloodthirsty monks in the service of the Lord.  The more intiment I have become with the entire history of Christianity and Europe in general, the more likely I can find a scenario such as the torture of de Molay as described.  Certainly, he was tortured- there is plenty of historical record on that and all the other Templars that were tortured and burned to death during their suppression. <br /> <br />So what?  Well, I say read the book and then do real objective research.  You will find as I have that the critics tend to fall into certain classes and much of what these men quote is either well known to many in the field or at least the opinion of learned scholars if not completely agreed upon. <br /> <br />Certainly, the world needs a cleansing from these bloody, middle eastern religions.  Books on alternative theories highly substantiable at some points - like this one are needed.  For a good review of Christianity's start read Joel Carmichael's \\"The Birth of Christianity.\\" <br /> <br />However, I am amazed over and over at how few people seem to have noticed the really remarkable message that this book contains.  The book of Enoch survived in Freemasonic literature and appears no where else until the Dead Sea Scrolls are made available for public study and voila, there it is, the Book of Enoch.  How did the Freemasons in England come to be the custodians of such an important text?  Yes, there must be a link and the most logical link is the digging of the temple ruins by the original nine Templars and the bloodline connection that other authors have discussed.  The Dukes of Lorraine and Burgundy knew they were there! <br /> <br />Unfortunately, too much of history is the history of cover-up and usurpation.  It is going to require people like PhDs of engineering and graphic artists who excel in historical research and alternative thinking to crack the \\"good old boys\\" club of established historical tradition.  If for no other reason than that you can't get into the club if you don't sing the right tune.  But that is changing, slowly. <br /> <br />Finally, one must realize that Freemasonry itself underwent a huge change after 1717 and was greiviously mangled by Christian apologists who added many degrees and Christian tradition to what had previously existed.  There is a historical competition of the London - York Rite against the Scottish Rite and the authors have been attempting to prove with their research and writings to show the London Grand Lodge that there needs to be a huge revision, bringing a completed and rational read to the story of Freemasonry in order for it to survive much longer.  If the reader understands some of these things, then the many turns of the book is easier to understand. <br /> <br />I gave this book four stars simply because it lacks a bibliography, which would have eliminated at leat 50% of the critics outright. <br /> <br />And that's how it goes	2005-10-11

She goes beyond the elements of story to create a palpable experience for her reader. Threads of art, music, food and poetry weave through the novel connecting main character, Lucy Beauregard, to the human experience. And as far as human experience goes, Les Becquets' cast of characters range from lecherous drama teacher, Mr. Banks, to portly and free spirited Tante Pearl. The characters are rounded and interesting, all having some kernel of wisdom to offer about getting through life the best way she/he can.<br /><br />What I like most about the novel is how Les Becquets creates a world for teens that gives credence to their thoughts and feelings. Lucy struggles to understand love in its many forms while discovering it herself, on her own terms. Most important, Les Becquets takes us out of the mall and into the beautiful scenery of the South, allowing her characters to rub against each other in a living, breathing landscape. A three dimensional landscape that caters to all of our senses.<br /><br />Original and true. Lucy's voice is strong and fresh. You won't be able to leave the book without having Les Becquet's characters and wisdoms tucked into your pocket. Somehow she is able to remind us that goodness in life boils down to something as simple as a strong friendship, a homemade meal, a Pablo Neruda poem, or a night under the stars. And that love - whether it be parental, platonic or passionate - finds us, and it doesn't always look the way we think it will.	2005-10-11

For a pastor who tries to study the Greek NT for sermon exegesis weekly, this book gives me a quick way to understand more about textual issues and nuances of meanings that I would normally miss.  One can learn a lot over time by referring to this book for 10 minutes or so for each sermon you develop...cherry picking relevant issues that relate to the text you are studying. Find the lesson to focus on in the Grammatical analysis book...then just read and reread the lesson in this book until you see clearly how it applies to your sermon (if it does).  That can be done in ten minutes or less for each grammatical lesson related to a paragraph of Greek NT.  Often he has 4 to 7 lessons associated with a paragraph! Each lesson varies in length from a couple lines of text to maybe a half page of stuff.  References and exampls in the NT are there so you can see clearly what he is talking about. That's a lot of practical Greek training built into a sermon! If you put that into the regular mix of your sermon exegesis, you will find your confidence in things like simple prepositions and the various meanings they can be used for growing by leaps and bounds.<br /><br />I think every pastor who works in the Greek NT should refer to this book alongside of Grammatical Analysis by Zerwick.  Gordon Fee also recommends this book in his NT Exegesis (3rd Edition) which is used in Bible Colleges and Seminaries around the world.  If you haven't used this book, you need to start in my view.	2005-10-11

For example, Grenz on how we respond to other religions reaches the startling conclusion that our answer will come from the question: \\"Which theologising community articulates an interpretive framework that is able to provide the transcendent vision for the construction of the kind of world that the particular community itself is in fact seeking?\\"  (p281).  Clearly each religious community believes that its own vision is the best way to produce the kind of community it desires - but the question remains, who or what decides whether any goal or approach that pertains to any particular community is valid or superior to another?  Without any obvious recourse to objective Truth (i.e. the revelation of Scripture) we are left helpless and only able to offer \\"well it works for me\\" apologetic.  Grenz's reluctance to talk in Truth categories risks producing a \\"Christianity\\" that is so far removed from that of the New Testament as to be unrecognisable.  It is right that Christians engage with our postmodern world and seek to understand it and respond to it - but this response causes me great concern.	2005-10-11

It covers lots of topics and gives solutions that, once thought about, make sense.  The format is of the book makes it easy to read, yet it covers a variety of topics.  The whole book is fascinating. <br /> <br />One of the things I learned is the damage done by our current culture of big government.  It harms the most vulnerable -- the poor and the disadvantaged.  Many of the programs set up to help people, hurt them.  And when you look at the root of the problem, it is because people rely on aggression to solve their problems, instead of voluntary cooperation and peaceful solutions. <br /> <br />This book is great for someone who love peace and is against aggression -- but it would be equally enjoyed by entreprenuers, business people, and those who seek prosperity.	2005-10-11

Books	3	21	25	N	N	Interesting but not great	There are some good \\"combat\\" techniques for knife throwing, but \\"life-saving material\\" as the title indicates, I kinda doubt it. The author does seem to know his stuff and the illustrations, while basic, are pretty clear and helpful. The quality of the writing, on the other hand, is a bit below par. Topics covered include an introduction to spear-style throwing, basics of combat knife throwing, balancing a knife for throwing, targeting, psychological/physical conditioning, hunting/recreation skills, and a bit of interesting historical/context stuff as well. There is also a fairly in-depth chapter for spear-style throwing as well as one for combat throwing techniques, insomuch as you can go in-depth in about a 100 total pages.<br /><br />It's an interesting tome but not really a groundbreaking one. It also has some iffy ideas. The challenge as I see it is that the focus of the book is primarily on techniques without looking at the larger picture. I've frankly got a philosophical problem with throwing a knife in combat, even if you are in the military. First off, only weapons balanced for throwing will work properly for that application in the first place so you must be carrying a specialty device in order to be able to execute the techniques. Once you do throw your knife not only do you potentially lose your weapon, but you are also operating at some distance from your opponent. Unless you are in an active war zone, that probably won't play too well in court. After all, if you've got distance you'll have to explain to a jury why you couldn't run away avoiding the confrontation before it became violent in the first place as well as why you were carrying an offensive weapon (throwing knives just aren't defensive devices no matter how you spin it... and knives in general are hard enough to justify in court as it is).<br /><br />I'm not all that great at knife throwing but I did learn some new stuff and improve a bit from this book. All in all, if you take it as an academic instruction book to develop throwing skills for fun or possibly even for survival/hunting it's a pretty decent reference. From a self-defense perspective, on the other hand, I think it is a bit off target.<br /><br />Lawrence Kane<br />Author of Surviving Armed Assaults, The Way of Kata, and Martial Arts Instructionbook to develop throwing skills for fun or possibly even for survival/hunting it's a pretty decent reference.

In my opinion, it is the most comprehensive and trenchant popular-level critique of the movement to date.  Carson has taken the time to read the major works and authors within the Emergent conversation, and based on several anecdotes related in the book, he has engaged many forums and individuals within the movement.  As a result, Carson deals fairly and charitably with the people and the positives of the theology and philosophy, and also has a solid footing for his critique.<br /><br />A crucial point of contention with Carson is what he calls the \\"wretched antithesis.\\"  Within postmodern philosophy, a typical dichotomy is that because we cannot be omniscient knowers, we must therefore be skeptical of all possible knowledge.  Unfortunately, Emergent picks up on this false dichotomy and fails to give appropriate emphasis to truth claims (however analogous, modest or straight-forward they may be) in Scripture.  I have also found it true that Emergent authors and pastors are unwilling to deal in terms of \\"truth\\" even though Scripture is not afraid to do so.<br /><br />Carson's call is not for a nasty end to Emergent, despite some of his detractors.  His call is for a real and honest dealing with the role of theology within the Church, and for Emergent to answer some of these serious critiques.  A great deal of Emergent thought is content to \\"ask questions\\" and thus feel vindicated in their apparent profundity.  Carson, and so many others, just want some substantive answers to serious questions.	2005-10-11

I thought about the things I may find out about Dylan which I don't want to know about. Then I thought, this man, who has wanted his life and personality to be shrouded in mystery, should remain that way for me. Sounces treats Dylan with a certain respect, the respect of a biographer. I don't believe this book is done in the AJ Weberman style of exposing Dylan for what a horrible person he is. He isn't. He's a person like any other, and this book gives us a glimpse of it. He was married, he got divorced- that separation affected him profoundly. Through the review of Dylan's life by this author, a negative side certainly manifests, but it is not without context of course. The joys Dylan experienced (his own private joys) cannot be described and should not be. There are details here to help us understand the context of Dylan's life. Truly this is no \\"No Direction Home\\" by Robert Shelton (widely referenced by Sounes), but it is something else entirely. If you are a Dylan fan who is interested in more than the music, this may be of interest, but not a definitive work of Dylan's life- that can nev er and will never exist. His life is his alone and I'm glad that he has been able to share as much as he has about his inspirations and his striving in Chronicles. Hope to see more of Dylan on Dylan soon.	2005-10-11

Globalization, an unstoppable force for both good and ill, has destroyed any possibility of American isolationism.

These homes are primarily older (as much as 300 years) that have been seriously redecorated to make them into jewels of plesant styling.  <br /> <br />For the most part, the redecoration of the homes has been to retain (or return to) the styling of the time they were built. Magnificant old beams show off well with modern appliances and decorations. The traditional outside of the houses hides the modern interiors. The original builders could not have imagined things we take for granted such as electricity that now has been fitted into their houses.  <br /> <br />Redoing an old house is easily as expensive as modern construction, so these houses have not been done for cost savings but for  other reasons like living in a part of history.  <br /> <br />While this book concentrates on this region of France, many of the techniques used in these houses could well be applied to houses in the United States where old houses be they farm or city center can be made into something unique and wonderful.	2005-10-11

Not all books live up to their advance advertizing, but this one advertized itself humbly and truthfully and gives more than it offers. I experienced a sense of relief: \\"Aha! THAT'S how I can do that\\".  <br /> <br />Mary Hunt urges readers who are deep in debt and short on resources to be hopeful, but also to get a grip on the problems. And then she gives concrete steps to work back up to the surface.  She urges those who are already swimming on the surface to make plans to stay afloat through expected and unexpected financial challenges. And she makes it sound like fun! <br /> <br />I subscribe to Mrs Hunt's monthly e-newsletter (Debtproof Living) and consider it a financial lifesaver. I've also read one of her previous books (same title) which jerked me into changing the way I managed my money. I was eager to order her new book, as soon as I saw mention of it in the newsletter, to support an author who has done so much for me and to get some practical help to \\"Live the Plan\\".  <br /> <br />I found strategies to try right away, as well as some things that look good but require another pass through the book. She's convinced me that it's important to plan ahead for what I can see coming and to live below my income so that I can enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing I'm ready for some unexpected twists in my financial life.   <br /> <br />Mrs Hunt's writing style is upbeat and respectful of the reader.  She has clear points of view, which she advocates without browbeating the reader, and she supports them with real life illustrations from her own life and from examples shared with her by readers of her other books and the newsletter. <br /> <br />If I was a new reader of Mrs Hunt's books, I would order Debt Proof Living and Live Your Life for Half the Price.  They go together well, although each can stand on it's own binding. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

He is a very good polemicist, both insightful and entertaining.      I found the chapter about Islam to be the weakest, and not because it was picking on that religion unfairly.  First, it seemed out of context, given the focus of the rest of the book on the United States, and second his view of the west seemed to change in that chapter and it threw me off.  In this chapter, the irrationality of Islam is not viewed in the context of the irrationality of Christianity, but in the context of the rationality of western secular liberalism.  So, rather than saying that the whole world is going crazy and that there is a real problem when you have two major forms of irrationality competing for dominance, that chapter makes us look really good in comparison.    Which, of course, we may . . . but that isn't the thrust of the book.    Harris buried a lot of his more technical arguments in the footnotes -- many of which are wonderful little essays in themselves -- leaving the body of the text as an informed look at this problem rather than an overly academic one.  And the look Harris takes is one which dares to question religion . . . an increasingly rare piece of courage in this country.    Harris is the only person I know of to write about ethics and morality without reference to intentions, thus denying a distinction between torture and accidents.  He gets transparently politicial in a few sections of this book, and you can see the quality of his reasoning change.	2005-10-11

Just a different title and different cover art, same book inside. This is not the author's fault by the way, it is just that 2 publishers have the right to publish her books, they Puffin and Macmillan, and this is what they have done. For some reason that is done with another book from this author, \\"Island of the Aunts\\" is also released as \\"Monster Mission\\". Personally, I like the artwork on the Macmillan covers better and it is nice to have the choice, as long as you know BEFORE you buy that it is the same book. Some people have been unhappy as they were hoping to get their hands on a new story by Eva. It is even worse if it is a gift.<br /><br />On to the story.... This is a book about a rich Texan that buys a Scottish Castle named Carra from the last heir of an old family, an orphan boy. But he does not want any ghosts included as he is worried that they will scare the little girl that will live in the castle. The millionaire ships the whole thing stone by stone and rebuilds it in Texas. But the castle does have ghosts, very nice ones who have helped raise the boy. They include a viking, a ghost dog, and Miss Spinks. What the millionaire does not notice is that the ghosts do come with the castle. The boy flies to America to get the ghosts out and stays in the castle. When they learn they cannnot stay, they move into an old movie theatre next door, where they meet the mysterious ghost hand. Somehow, he is trying to solve the mystery of his murder many years ago. And when the little girl is kidnapped for ransom, the ghosts must join the effort to rescue her and the boy.<br /><br />This book is suspenseful, but hilarious. The author creates the most charming characters you can imagine. I strongly reccommend.	2005-10-11

This one was given to me as a gift, and I approached it without knowing anything about either the author or his character, Gabriel Allon. I found \\"The English Assassin\\" to be a well-written novel, with decent characterization and a good pace. The Gabriel character himself was, for me, the most interesting part of the book, and the one thing that might someday cause me to pick up another Silva novel.<br /><br />That said, there were a number of things about the book that I found relatively unsatisfying, most of which I think I can mention without giving away the ending. For one thing, Silva's portrayal of the evil Swiss was pretty heavy-handed. I don't know how much of what's here comes from Silva's own research or conclusions, how much was ginned up to ride the wave of \\"expos&eacute;s\\" of Swiss complicity in Nazi horror that came out in the late 1990s, and how much of it was manufactured for the purposes of this novel. But for a balance to the novel's subtext that Switzerland is the last outpost of the Third Reich, I recommend the nonfiction [[ASIN:089526238X Between the Alps & A Hard Place: Switzerland in World War II and Moral Blackmail Today]] by Angelo M. Codevilla (2000).<br /><br />Looking at the story itself, I thought the conclusion was somewhat unsatisfying, and the action described in the very last chapter more than a little out of character for the people involved. It's certainly true that spycraft seldom has the satisfying endings -- filled with massive and colorful explosions -- we've come to expect from James Bond movies. The tradition of spy novels leaving the reader thinking \\"That's it?\\" is hardly new, and captures the shadowy world in which these people operate. But from a storytelling standpoint, it leaves a little to be desired.<br /><br />On the whole, however, Daniel Silva is a formidable talent. The story certainly held my attention, moved quickly, and focused on characters who (with the exception mentioned above) acted true-to-life. I think fans of the genre would find more than enough to satisfy them.the exception mentioned above) acted true-to-life.

Oddly, it was a college textbook -- otherwise, I probably never would have come across it.  As I read more Greek History books, I always came back to this one. <br /> <br />Bury not only is an engaging author, but he doesn't ascribe to a 'special' school.  History is not just economics and sociology, governmental systems, or great leaders.  All of these elements of history are well presented.  Furthermore, Bury has just the right mix of presenting history and of speculation, with an emphaisis on the former (as a textbook); nonetheless, his speculations and comments are thoughtful and outstanding.  He is balanced.  When he talks about tyrants, he went through the gamut of beneficial ones like Cleithenes of Sicyon, enlightened but despotic like Cypsalis of Corinth, and the usual bad ones. <br /> <br />As an example of his insights, he discusses how clever Cyrus II was (the man that tried to take over the Persian throne with Greek mercenaries, leading to the Anabasis), and how he at an early time made military innovations with the Greek phalanx he had as his mercenary army.   Bury speculates how a Greek victory, putting Cyrus on the throne, would have been bad for Greece as a whole, since Persia would have an innovative and energetic king.  <br /> <br />The book is full of facts.  It is not a fast read.  Noentheless, it is simply a great source book and very good reead for ancient Greek History. <br />	2005-10-11

US	12999621	R3HCTVXMI6WSMX	0743432932	783155306	The Intelligencer	Books	2	7	8	N	N	Another Literary 'Thriller'	Mostly junk, but at least it's fairly decently researched junk. There are basically two plot lines going on; one is a modern day thriller with a tough but sexy (groan...) female P.I. out to decode an ancient manuscript believed to be the work of a famous Elizabethan spy, the other is the story of the manuscript itself and centers on the playwright Christopher Marlowe and the part he played in Elizabeth I's secret espionage network.<br /><br />The Elizabethan parts were not terrible, although, Silbert seemingly can't help putting in way too much exposition which would be better left to footnotes or an afterword. She also can't resist adding an extraneous (semi-) romantic interest for the Kit Marlowe story when the plot was carrying along just fine without it. (This happens to be one of my pet-peeves about mass-market movies, books, etc. They always feel that regardless of genre, people won't get into the story without a little splash of sex, no matter how irrelevant it may be.)<br /><br />The modern-day parts, on the other hand, were dead awful and used and abused every spy-novel clich&eacute; ever invented. The characters were one-dimensional ( the beautiful and dangerous heroine with a tragic secret, the gentleman cat-burgler [nickname 'The Cat', natch..], the millionaire playboy with a hot bod and a face 'to put a Versace model to shame') and simply traded one-liners rather than actually conversing and the degree of autobiographicality was horrendous (the heroine, like the author, quit a career in Renaissance scholarship to become a private eye). As a whole it's badly written and even the characters' internal monologues are clich&eacute;-ridden and embarrassing to read; e.g. \\"While Kate disappeared onto the opposite shore, Jack also wondered how she would react if he ever told her that he'd been in love with her for as long as he could remember.\\" Ouch!<br /><br />All of which I might have been able to forgive if the book had at least partially delivered on its promises of being a literary thriller. But it didn't. There was a little bit of code-breaking that went on, but it was all too pat, too cut-and-dried with no room for suspense, no theories tentatively advanced to be proven wrong later, no stunning breakthroughs. In fact, almost all the actual deciphering occurs off-stage with the heroine simply reporting later \\"Oh by the way, I deciphered the texts and they say blah blah blah...\\" Now, where's the excitement in that?<br /><br />So, I'm going to have to give 'The Intelligencer' a 'D' and recommend that you don't read it, unless, like me, you are a sucker for even bad code-breaking cloak-and-dagger stuff.being a literary thriller.

The Progressives were at their peak in influence from the late 19th Century until the end of World War I, from Theodore Roosevelt's administration to Woodrow Wilson's administration. As McGerr stated, Progressives wanted to transform Americans into their own image of a middle class society, uplifting the poorest workers while chastising the wealthiest. It is this transformative vision that makes the Progressive movement stand out from most other political movements in our country's history. In addition to transforming Americans, McGerr says Progressives wanted to end class conflict, use government to control big businesses, and use segregation to help implement their objectives successfully.<br /><br />McGerr is effective in adding the human dimension to his history of Progressivism. The Garlands, young Rahel Golub and her immigrant family, the Bradley-Martins and others are all used to give an image of who some of the wage laborers, upper class and progressive reformers were. The reformers include many of the standard names like Hull-House founder Jane Addams, salon smashing Carrie Nation, Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, and a host of other reformers in all different strata of society. Many organizations that formed to support the various agendas of the Progressive movement are also mentioned, including the Anti-Saloon League, the Country Life Commission, and others that represented various Progressive causes.<br /><br />I felt the author was most focused on and interested in the Progressive belief in transforming other people to conform to this middle class vision of society and he handles the issue very ably. Whether it be their dislike of rugged individualism or their crusades against personal vices like divorce and alcohol or their belief in the promises of education, the Progressives truly believed people could be changed and molded into their way of thinking. While a bold and radical idea, it is also naive and arrogant. As time revealed, people grew tired and resistant to the Progressive idea of changing people's attitudes and way of living. Times had changed with technological innovations like the automobile and new recreational and leisure activities that allowed for a new sense of personal freedom. The effects of World War I and the new challenges in a post-war society also added to the decline of Progressive ideals.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I didn't think the author gave a lot of attention to more of the legislative accomplishments of the Progressive Era, especially during the Wilson Administration, but overall as well. He mentioned many topics that led to enacted legislation, but generally with little detail. McGerr is quite good in showing the larger picture and how people reacted to the movement and how external factors effected its progression and or decline. The social aspects of the Progressive movement are his clear strong points. From a political standpoint I think the author was more sympathetic to the more radical reformers who wanted greater, more broad-sweeping reform. He shows the Progressives for who they were and what they hoped to achieve, with their strengths and their flaws. I think he is right in assessing the times we live in as a bit disappointing politically. But as he stated, that is one of the consequences of the Progressive Era with its high hopes and expectations, expectations that realistically could never be accomplished.<br /><br />The Progressives can be credited for bringing many political, economic and social issues to the forefront of public debate as well as leaving a legacy of some very notable legislative accomplishments that endure to this day. Ultimately, they could not overcome the innate belief held by so many concerning the importance of the individual and that person's belief in being allowed to achieve whatever type of life and way of living they felt entitled to pursue without other individuals, groups or government telling them how to live. As McGerr stated in his conclusion, the Progressives overreached; they tried to accomplish too much. The backlash it produced has led other leaders as well as a large section of the population to approach any mention of reform, at least in relation to individuals, with a justifiable amount of caution.	2005-10-11

I'm sure I'm taken in by much of it as well, but even I can't be fooled all the time.<br /><br />Still, the answer is not to simply give up.  On a few topics, I actually am well enough informed so that (while I still may be susceptible to propaganda myself) I can recognize the symptoms of others falling for it.  And this is definitely a phenomenon one ought to look for in others if one wants to cure oneself!  I do think we ought to try to become so informed about at least a few topics that we can recognize nonsense.  On these topics, we ought to listen, but we also ought to be unafraid to state facts and make judgments.  On other topics, we ought to be much more careful.<br /><br />Perhaps the most dramatic examples for me have been some truly amazing statements about the Arab war on Israel made by some rather well-educated and generally skeptical people.  It makes me wonder why those who are ready to challenge all sorts of claims in so many other areas accept some extremely dubious, afactual, and illogical nonsense about this topic without question, and repeat it to me.  Are they unaware that they are making statements that may well be false?  Are they unable to discuss this issue without making very controversial comments as if they were not only accepted and indisputable facts, but relevant facts as well?<br /><br />On one occasion, when I suggested to a colleague that I happened to know quite a bit about the Arab war against Israel, hoping to politely give him a way to defer to me, temporarily, on a couple of facts, I merely got an outraged reply.  Was I not aware that my colleague was a highly intelligent and well-informed person?  What made me think that I knew something he didn't?  I was more than a little surprised by such a reaction: normally if a person claims to know something better than we do, we listen, even if we disagree.<br /><br />This book, written over four decades ago, helps explain a little of what is going on.  It shows how intellectuals can be so horribly susceptible to propaganda.  As both the book and Konrad Kellen's preface to it state, intellectuals absorb a great deal of second-hand and unverifiable information.  They often feel a need to have an opinion about such information.  In addition, they consider themselves so smart that they can \\"judge for themselves.\\"  And they seriously underestimate their susceptibility to propaganda given that they can see mere idiots reject some of it with ease.<br /><br />The truth, as Ellul explains, is that high intelligence, a broad culture, constant use of critical faculties, and access to and use of sources of information are indeed the best weapons against propaganda.  They simply aren't used often enough.<br /><br />Ellul shows how propaganda can have a powerful effect if one is saturated with it.  It is useful, he explains, to have someone from one's own frame of reference come up with it.  The German National Socialists were careful to put Englishmen on their radio.  Anti-Zionists, by the way, are very proud to have Jews state their case, although we should all know that there is no objective reason to trust every Jew, any more than there is to trust every person.<br /><br />We readers see how propaganda is most useful when it reinforces earlier biases and misconceptions.  And how it becomes extremely powerful once a person makes an active commitment to a cause: that person finds it very tough to recant.<br /><br />The book also shows how propaganda gets one to come up with strange ideas about what is relevant material to support one's arguments.  That has the effect of precluding dialog with those who disagree with you.  That's why my colleague \\"knew\\" better than to take anything I said seriously or reply to it coherently.  And it is why careful and cautious statements on my part sounded not merely like admissions that truth was fiction, and vice-versa, but evidence that I was hopelessly biased, impervious to reason, and hooked on rather wild propaganda myself.<br /><br />This book is fascinating.  It made me realize that propaganda is indeed more effective than most of us might realize.  And that it is dangerous.  Ellul implies that propaganda may well be the most serious threat we humans face.  And I think we ought to treat it as such.that truth was fiction, and vice-versa, but evidence that I was hopelessly biased, impervious to reason, and hooked on rather wild propaganda myself.   <br /> <br />This book is fascinating.

Thomas Lewis poetically, shares a story of incredible love and compassion between a husband, wife and their newly adopted, orphaned child, while they are subjected to the cruelty of war and sickness of the human heart.  Your tears will flow at the beauty and strength of their love for one another while at the same time pour over the persecution of innocent people for their belief in God.   Above all else, Nadia knows how to love; she has no understanding war and all the politics that surround it.  Nor does she understand this deep burning within her for a man she has never met.  Who is this man and how does he come to her in her dreams?  Join Nadia and her family on their terrifying journey to freedom and allow yourself to be swept away by the innocence of a child, blind to all the evil acts adults inflict upon one another.  Faith will conquer hate, love will conquer cruelty and God will lead the way.  Note: A remarkable difference between this author and all others is that 50% of all proceeds have been promised and will be donated to heal the many sick patients at St. Jude's Children's Hospital.	2005-10-11

In this book four couples became pregnant the first time out.  One couple eventually gave up.   Another couple was introduced off the cuff as the \\"try again\\" set they were not even given names, but referred to as wife and husband.  It seems that a good quarter of the book is devoted to the pregnancy, which I never got to.  I am glad that this book is out there.  It covers the process and is helpful for positive outcomes.  I did not find any solace in the negative outcome here.  Also, all the couples are childless before IVF.

Not the greatest, to be sure, but he writes his books knowledgably (see \\"Tracks in the Sea\\" for his greatest work, in my opinion). In \\"Naval Battles of the Civil War\\" he rounds out the series of \\"Rebels and Yankees\\" books by William C. Davis. Davis is a fantastic historian with excellent writing skills. Nonetheless, he is obviously biased when it comes to the naval aspect of the Civil War. In the \\"Rebels and Yankees\\" series there are several errors in the artistic representation of sailors as well as factual eroors in the pring itself. Davis considers the Navies of the Civil War to be inconsequential because they did not see as much combat as the Army, and thus does not put much effort into recording them. <br />Hearn, a naval historian, does a much better and much more thorough job than the usually adept Davis. There are a few small errors (a U.S. Marine button is erroneously declared a Naval officer's button), but \\"Naval Battles of the Civil War\\" is an otherwise fine and worthwhile book.	2005-10-11

The surreal province, David Almond has created in his fifth book, Secret Heart, is dark, haunting, and reminiscent of the stylistic and contextual elements of English classics produced by the likes of C. S. Lewis and even Kipling. Simple, stuttering, dreamy Joe Maloney is the prototypical, ostracized young boy who doesn't fit in. He has phenomenal powers, of imagination and observation, bordering upon the supernatural.   <br /> <br />The progression of the first half of the plot is rather slow but steady. The reader travels to the town of Helmouth in the slums of England, where `nothing happened. In helmouth, everything came to just nothing.' Adding to this gloomy setting are the despicable occupants of this town who simply cannot allow someone like Joe to live peacefully.  <br />The novel explores some wonderful themes pertaining to self knowledge, gender expectations, and the reconceptualization of the traditional hero. Furthermore, it is undoubtedly a great work of imagistic wealth, containing aspects of stream of consciousness. The dynamics of a parent-child relationship are also subtly addressed through Joe's `Mum's' willingness to give him space and credit to develop and grow, even though he is, conventionally speaking, a special child. Nonetheless, there are certain disturbing elements in Almond's work as well. While it may not appear so in a first reading of the text, on closer reading, the novel appears to be rather didactic. For instance, it brings to fore the time long battle between man and nature, in which nature symbolizes goodness, renewal, and rebirth while man is emblematic of meaningless destruction and hate. There is no middle path offered as one can either be one or the other as is depicted in Joe's ability to blend into the natural world. The novel also appears to negate, organized institutions symbolized by Joe's aversion to school, the psychologists, and social workers who desecrate the sanctity of his domestic and mental privacy. Whether that's entirely justified is for the reader to decide. Moreover, the fact that Joe chooses `the wilderness, the larks, the rats and rabbits and stoats. And he accepted the loneliness that went with this choice,' raises the question whether the novel is promoting a life of escapism, exile, and self-isolation for those who think differently. It can also be perceived as concluding that only people at odds with conventional society, like the circus people and Joe, are truly kindred souls with noble missions.  <br />There are certain jarring discrepancies in the plot as well. For instance, while it seems to propagate the respect of nature there is morbid sadism involved in the Hackenschmidt's treatment of the poor Andulican goats that are transformed into unicorns through a cruel process.  <br />Although Almond's novel is classified as children's literature, it is redolent with sophisticated literary and philosophical context like naturalism and reincarnation granting it an edge over other children's literature that undermines the reader's ability to grapple with complicated ideologies. All in all, keeping mind Almond's admirable record of award-winning children's literature, the Secret Heart is highly recommended reading. The only pre-requisite is that it be approached with an intelligent and critical approach so that none of the true wealth contained in it is lost.   <br />	2005-10-11

My French isn't up to assessing the quality of this translation, but the prose seems sensuous and discreet, the work of a particularly precise and practical mind. 'The Fetishist' is a collection of short stories, each playfully perverting any whiff of inevitability. Tournier's deadly wit is evident in equal measure throughout, though,'Prickly','The Red Dwarf','The Woodcock','Death and the Maiden,and,'Lily of the Valley Lay-by' especially enchant. If you haven't read the weightier works, you have a treat in store. But these fabulous tales will set you in the Tournier meter. Surreal? Yes, for all their formal structure and classic allusions, their beguiling surfaces are determined to deceive. Not through the verbal or linguistic collisions of surrealistic poetry, but in the polished inversions of the 'rational' found in Magritte and Ernst. Tournier's dense but balletic footwork has kinship with Umberto Ecco's fiction. For all the sexual darkness that permeates Tournier's ouvre, there is also what he defines as,'white humour', a marriage of the cosmic with the comic. It's an apt definition of what I find contagious about his writing, extending even to his excellent autobiography,'The Wind Spirit'.	2005-10-11

The Color of the Soul by Tracey Bateman is about a young black man's struggle to find his identity and carve out his own niche in a world where only whites are regarded with respect. Along the way, he discovers the truth about his own past and family heritage. <br /> <br />As a northerner transplanted to the Deep South, I was impressed with the author's handling of the subject of Southern race relations in both 1948 and the 1800's, and with her attempt to bridge the gap between whites and blacks. <br /> <br />But this is far more than a story about being black or white-it's a powerful illustration of God's ability to redeem tragedy and heartbreak. The book drew me in from the first page, and at the last kept me up till 3 AM. I wept through the last pages, then found myself thanking the Lord for His similar mercy in my own life, and for allowing me to experience what love and happiness that I have. <br /> <br />When a story can turn us so fully to praise of God's redeeming hand, it doesn't get much better. This one's a keeper . . . a life-changer . . . don't miss it. <br />	2005-10-11

Furthermore, it's for those who want more out of fantasy writing than cliches such as dragons and pointy hats, as you'll find neither.  I will not summarize the plot; this book and the rest of the series deserve better than a simple overview.  These books are about what makes us who we are.     John Marco's imagination and style have painted a wonderful world of characters to which we all can relate.  Some of these people are granted an Akari which empowers them with a magic to overcome, a gift which is either a blessing or a curse which the characters much each accept in their own way.  The characters never lose their human aspects, such as fallibility, lending a sense of familiarity and attachment to the characters.  Regardless of if they have an Akari, the human struggle can be seen in all of the characters as some long for power, other long for love, wisdom, or peace.      The series portray more than a simple fantasy blessed by John's unbounded imagination.  A document of the psychology behind the human condition, this saga will remind one in a whimsical way of the desires and fears which makes us all inevitably human.	2005-10-11

FLUSH is his second children's book, and although it isn't quite as funny as HOOT (which garnered him a Newbery Honor), it satisfies on all levels. <br /> <br />Brother and sister Noah and Abbey (named after the late Edward Abbey) are out to prove their dad wasn't making it up when he claimed a local casino boat owner had been dumping sewage illegally overboard, where it fouls a local beach.  Unfortunately their Dad, taking a cue from THE MONKEY WRENCH GANG has gone a little too far to make his point -- by sinking the boat -- and is put in jail, where he compares himself to Nelson Mandela and begins granting media interviews. <br /> <br />One man's civil disobedience is another's sabotage, and Noah finds himself in the middle, as his mother is angry enough to use the D word (divorce).  Noah and Abbey set out to prove their father's motive was pure, and after many plot twists, they manage to do so in a thoroughly satisfying way.	2005-10-11

As such, he seeks to train under Evangeline, who proved to be a VERY impressive mage when not under the restrictions of the curse.  At the same time, he decides to learn Kung Fu from Ku Fei-san to improve his melee attack and defence skills.  Ku Fei agrees to train him, but Evangeline is offended that he would learn Kung Fu and decides he must lay one hit on Chachamaru before she will train him.<br /><br />Meanwhile, gymnast Makie-chan discovers her coach finds her too childish to be a great gymnast.  Devistated, she happens upon a training Negi and decides to train to get even better for an upcoming competition. While they train, Se-chan and Asuna-san decide to train in sword techniques.  On the night of Negi's fight with Chachamaru, Negi takes a beating but gets Evengeline to agree to train him.<br /><br />Meanwhile Yue-san and Miyazaki come to Negi with some clues about Negi's father.  This leads the trio on a trip to library island without Asuna where they discover yet another dangerous secret of the island.  Asuna finds out and is offended, but things get worse when she and Negi get into a verbal fight and Negi seriously insults her. A trip by the girls to Ayaka's private beach doesn't help matters.  Will Negi be able to appologize for what he said?  Will Asuna forgive him?  Will Negi be able to master all of the training in time for the next battle?  Will Makie-chan prove her coach wrong?<br /><br />With this volume, Akamatsu-sensei is clearly taking things down a few notches in intensity but is laying the groundwork for the next big story.  The fight between Asuna and Negi was a lot like the fights between Naru and Keitaro in \\"Love Hina\\", but I suppose that's to be expected.

I have read other works by Mr. Gilbert, and found this one extremely disappointing because of its literary style, although the content was o.k.	2005-10-11

(if you're looking for an ineffective, shoddy, cookie cutter "system" for the masses)	This book was recommended to me by two traders in their top 10 trading books list.  Knowing how successful they both are (with a combined trading experience of 65 years and immense wealth built for both of them in that time), I put a lot of faith in their recommendations.   <br /> <br />But when I went to this site to purchase the book, I almost didn't buy it because of some of the bad reviews.  It isn't until after having read the book that I understand WHY the book was recommmended so highly by successful traders but somehow got poor reviews from traders who seem to still be searching for answers.  The reason is very simple... <br /> <br />The reviewers who didn't like this book are looking for the \\"easy way\\". They want the \\"Quick Fix Holy Grail\\".  They want their profits spoon-fed. What they fail to realize is that if any author gives them what they are looking for they are doing them a great disservice.  <br /> <br />Brown starts the book off with the implied purpose of taking a trader to the next level--beyond the level of what she refers to as the \\"Stochastics Default Club\\".  Her purpose is to create a trader who is not only ahead of the \\"group think\\" of the masses but also ahead of the automated trading styles that have developed from shallow understanding of basics (and rote execution of out-dated techniques).   <br /> <br />As the inside flap of the book states, \\"Global Professional traders, frustrated by inexplicable indicator failures and capital erosion, must set themselves apart by challenging many beliefs widely accepted as gospel in today's trading world.\\"    <br /> <br />Brown obviously went into this book knowing a few things: <br /> <br />1.  The mass disemmination of any rote trading system will only invalidate that system's effectiveness. <br />2.  The precise tools she uses would be deadly if revealed to any \\"Holy Grail\\" seeker looking for a simple fixed logic tree system. <br />3.  Successful traders become successful only because of their ownhard work and diligence. <br /> <br />Knowing these things, I imagine she decided the best way for her to contribute to the field of technical analysis would be to teach people how professionals think with technical analysis (NOT how the at-home speculator thinks with his coffee spilled on his shirt waiting for his incorrectly timed stochastics to cross back over 20 for a buy signal). <br /> <br />She succeeds in her purposes--but only to the degree of the reader's willingness.   <br /> <br />A good portion of this book is dedicated to HOW to start viewing technical analysis the way a pro does (from dissecting and perfecting indicators to developing your own trading system).  Also, in Chapter 10 she brings everything together and shows how it's done--in \\"real-time\\" journal style.  <br /> <br />Yes, she does show you some very precise techniques that you can incorporate in your own trading.  No, she doesn't give her Composite Index formula or Gann conversions (and I'm happy she doesn't because doing so would be a disservice not only to herself and her own hard work but also to any \\"one-track mind\\" trader who got his hands on them). <br /> <br />After reading this book, I agree with the two traders, their trading records and their bank accounts--this book is one of the top-ten trading books available. <br /> <br />But remember:  Do NOT read this book if all you are looking for is an ineffective, shoddy, cookie cutter \\"system\\" for the masses. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

The information for each entry is brief and by the time you remove sentiments like 'here's a belief that is so quaint/useless/Irish' and 'I don't know where this notion came from and I guess we never will' and 'I don't know why this idea persists when it's so clearly wrong,' there's hardly any information left behind.  I don't know which was more grating: the lack of information or her insulting tone throughout the book.  I don't know why someone who clearly does not have an academic enjoyment or respect for superstitions would choose to write about them.  Also, if excessive use of exclamation points annoys you, that will be another strike against this book.  Two examples:    \\"Hat: If you wear a hat, be careful how you put it on -for an old superstition decrees that you are in for a day of badluck if you put it on the wrong way round.  There is, though, a rather expensive way of countering the bad luck -buy a new hat!  In America it is said that if a lady puts on a gentleman's hat then it is a sign -unconscious or not- that she wishes to be kissed!\\"    \\"Kettle:  young girls are warned by superstition not to turn a boiling kettle around so that the spout faces the wall or they will never find a husband.  Apart, of course, from the damage the steam might well do to the paintwork!\\"    I'm returning my copy.	2005-10-11

In his posts, obviously trying and failing to mock true 5 star reviewers, he indicates that he doesn't know what he is talking about and to that one statement I agree! In fact I agree wholeheartily. This Kerry fan is totally and utterly clueless. No wonder he can't find it in bookstores. He needs a pardon just to get out to go to the bookstores. Here is why.    Notice he didn't post at all on Sunday? Perhaps his warden doesn't let him or his inmate friends use the internet on Sundays.     Great to see UFC back in the best seller ranks again and am looking forward to the paperback version which I am sure will have updates on John Kerry's character and actions regarding election '04 and his actions post election '04.    Oh, one more thing. This paid Kerry shill keeps saying that he isn't worried about these 5 star posts supporting The Swiftboat Vets and claims it is all bogus right? If that is so, then why does he always try to one up the articulate posts and has yet to provide even one iota of evidence to his claims that Kerry was a hero? Perhaps like Kerry, he thinks if he can retell a lie often enough, people will believe it. And I guess that explains why Kerry is still lagging behind Pres. Bush by a 75/25 ratio even as Pres. Bush's ratings have dropped to an all time low.    Okay Peter H. Your turn. Show us what a blooming idiot you really are. You are no average idiot, you are an above average idiot.	2005-10-11

The big downside to these volumes is that they eventually split in half! However... I also own a stack of other film encyclopedias but for weight and manageability this is the best of the lot. The book is around 2 inches thick - but is the size of a novel and you can hold it in one hand. It is a full resource (with over 18,000 titles!), easy to carry around and has a full listing of directors and cast at the back along with Oscar winners. Overall the reviews are not very good and they are limited to just four of five lines at best. I mostly do not use it for the reviews though. It is more of a \\"find a director or star that you like and quickly flick through the index and the corresponding works to see what else they have done\\". For that it is very impressive but if you are looking for in-depth reviews then you should go elsewhere for the more unmanageable volumes and Arnold Schwarzenner to help carry them around for you.	2005-10-11

But Leonard has had a great career, and \\"Swag\\" is a terrific early example of what he does best.<br /><br />Frank and Ernest meet when Ernest tries to steal a car at the lot where Frank works. Impressed by his moxie, Frank helps the thief out of a bind and then hits him with a proposition: How about we go after some big bucks?<br /><br />What Frank has in mind is a little strong-arm wealth appropriation, and for a while it works out pretty well. Cruising through the suburbs of Detroit, the pair hit bars, supermarkets, and liquor stores, flashing their pistols just enough to get what they want. The story is fast-paced, exciting, and fun, with lots of vignettes of assorted crimes. Though not likely to resonate with the reader after, it's an impressive example of Leonard's mastery of the form. He gets us to actually care about these lowlifes and wish them well, even as they rob innocent people of their hard-earned cash.<br /><br />Leonard does this by focusing on one of the pair, Ernest \\"Stick\\" Stickley. He's not enjoying the stick-up work, and thinks about leaving it for a chance to spend more time with his estranged daughter. But Stick has some things worth sticking around for, like the \\"career ladies\\" who hang around the pool where he and Frank Ryan live. To what extent can Stick trust Frank not to mess things up? Is Frank playing Stick for a fool? And why is he hanging around so much with the owner of a seedy nightclub?<br /><br />Some reviewers here suggest this is like a Quentin Tarantino version of \\"The Odd Couple,\\" which works for me. Though both men are more Oscar than Felix, we do see them in a number of amusing domestic arguments. There's that line from the TV show that comes back to me in thinking about this novel, Oscar telling Felix \\"Be cool.\\" That's a standard mantra in Leonard books, and you can hear Stick telling Frank this on almost every page as the action heats up in the second half.<br /><br />Before throwing them to the sharks, Leonard has fun figuring out how crime might indeed pay, as long as Frank and Stick follow Frank's ten simple rules for committing crimes. They're good rules, too. The problem is human nature being what it is, it's hard to stick with the program even when it's working, especially when you add booze, broads, and bullets to the mix.<br /><br />Leonard actually saves a lot of his twists for the ending, one of the best he's ever written. It's hard not to call this a classic, but there are more involving Leonard books out there, and more suspenseful ones. Still, you can't do much better for whipsmart dialogue. He has a way of getting you to pay attention with a few small words, like by having one heavy ask a simple question like: \\"Why would a man want to die at his age?\\"<br /><br />A book you can read in a single day, \\"Swag\\" has a lot going for it, the best being there's a lot more where it came from.s a standard mantra in Leonard books, and you can hear Stick telling Frank this on almost every page as the action heats up in the second half.

I will leave to others whether Joe Hayes' book, This Thing Called Courage, accurately portrays every Southie nuance and idiomatic expression.  As I see it, photograhic realism is not the point of the book in any case.  <br /> <br />The thread running through the book for me is courage.  Despite TV's current portrayal of gay manhood as a cross between vaudvillian and effortless male model, the lives of real gay men demand courage in navigating every day life.  Hayes shows that in 1960s-70s South Boston, it took real courage not to look away when a friend's stare said more than all the words in the dictionery.   <br /> <br />Hayes does not sugarcoat the harshness of growing up gay in a working class, Catholic neighborhood but he looks for (and finds) the good in those values.  By the end of the book, despite the tragedy of suicides and drugs that have engulfed Southie, Hayes still believes in the possibilty of miracles and magic made possible by love, whether from a mysterious nun from the Middle East, or the combustible passion of two teenagers who drop their swagger long enough to let their Irish eyes smile.  <br /> <br />In the end, this is not a book about one neighborhood -- but all neighborhoods where individual people refuse to stay within the geography others set for them.  <br /> <br />Stories about chosing to listen to the heart rather than the expectations of others are not rare in literature.  But Hayes' strong narrative voice and memorable descriptions combined with the relative novelty of his subject matter make this seem like very new ground.  I look forward to reading his books for years to come. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

I believe this to be<br /><br />one of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br /> I absolutely loved this book.<br /><br />Lizzie is killed in a hit and run accident and Elsewhere is the story of<br /><br />her ' afterlife '. I don't wish to write any more than that because this<br /><br />book is an absolute must- read. To tell more of the story would be to<br /><br />spoil a book that will really challenge your beliefs and perspective<br /><br />about life after death. No-one really knows what happens after death.<br /><br />Each reader will bring their own personal philosophy to Zevin's story,<br /><br />but what became apparent as I progressed through the book was that if<br /><br />life after death was like the Elsewhere of the story, human beings would<br /><br />fear death less and learn to appreciate wherever they are in their stage<br /><br />of development in-life and after-life.<br /><br />Zevin has taken such an everyday concept, turned it on its head and<br /><br />written what can only be described as a convincing believable story<br /><br />about where we go and what happens to everyone when they die.<br /><br />The tone is hopeful, the prose realistic and beautiful. The ending is<br /><br />utterly perfect. The story is infused with life lessons and gentle<br /><br />morals without being sanctimonious in the least. In some ways I find it<br /><br />hard to say all that I really feel about this book, that my words will<br /><br />not do justice to the story.<br /><br />Zevin has left no stone unturned. Her tale covers: what happens to<br /><br />animals, how you progress to the ' afterlife,' how you make contact with<br /><br />life on earth, and how you become reborn, amongst many other questions<br /><br />people have about ' what happens when you die ?'. The story is in no way<br /><br />contrived but highly plausible. I found myself crying consistently on<br /><br />and off throughout the story, not because it was sad, but because it was<br /><br />so buoyant and made so much sense about dealing with what is almost<br /><br />always a disagreeable topic.<br /><br />Elsewhere is a book that good readers of 13 and above would enjoy. It<br /><br />poses so many philosophical questions and ideas that would be excellent<br /><br />for use in a \\" Gifted and Talented \\"  class. The idea of getting younger<br /><br />as opposed to getting older would be an excellent starting point for<br /><br />some creative writing. Students often want to get older quickly before<br /><br />they've had chance to experience being young, so the possibility of<br /><br />becoming younger and debating what happens at the point of birth could<br /><br />open up some amazing philosophical discussion.<br /><br />In short this book is brilliant.

Every year they make a new one of these books, and they are almost identical for the exception of that they have little tid bits on \\"new in 2005\\" or \\"new in 2006\\".  Don't bother buying this book every time a new version of AutoCAD  comes out either, they are all almost the same.  <br /> <br />That being said, it works well to guide people that are learning autoCAD on the right path.  The tutorials show you multiple ways of achieving the same thing, so the user can deside what way suits him/her best and continue on from there (personally I love using the command prompt).  I'm about 3/4 of the way through the book right now, and it's done a good job giving me the BASICS of autoCAD, I don't think this book would be very good for teaching advanced principles, however I don't think it was advertised to do so. <br /> <br />So basically. <br /> <br />If you are learning, it's good <br />If you already know autoCAD, it's not good <br />If you already have an book covering an older year of AutoCAD, don't bother buying a newer book <br /> <br />Hope this helps!	2005-10-11

There are simple back-story elements that are alluded to, but not explained, in the games, including the eponymous fall of the military depot/naval base called Reach. <br /> <br /> There are also some very nice touches, such as one of the absolute best ship-to-ship warfare fights I have ever seen, and some nice geek moments. For example, there's a cool little bit referring to Einsteinian physics, alluding to the Covenant's ability to travel unnoticed through slipspace (I.e., the ships cause so much gravimetric distortion, they appear to be a comet, instead of just several really huge ships). <br /> <br />All in all, I went from assuming I was holding a second-rate tie-in book to being delighted by one of the best sci-fi novels I have ever read. I HIGHLY recommend this work to anyone who enjoys science-fiction and/or good military stories, even if you couldn't care less about the Halo video game!	2005-10-11

As a mother to 3 kids under the age of 4, I was living a life of chaos.  Our kids were really tenderhearted and sweet, but our lack of any disapline or structure was turning our children into monsters!  I didn't read the original book - I didn't ever have that much time!  This book was very easy to read, and very thourough.  I felt that the repitition of certain techniques was wonderful, I knew what to try without having to re-read the book trying to find the important points. This book has changed our outlook as parents, and we have been able to bring calm and peace to our very young home.  I highly reccomend this book to overwhelmed parents of young children.	2005-10-11

This isn't just an actress' gathering of Hollywood celebrity associations, but a memoir of growing up too fast in the 1960s, struggling with drugs and fame, and entering the world of fashion and modeling. The black and white centerfold of photos follows her highlights, but it's her own words which document a striking life - and a striking era.	2005-10-11

Books	5	1	1	N	N	Review by Dale Jungk, Editor-in-Chief, Sun Rising Press	Suzanne Tilden-Mortimer's new autobiography Do I Know You? is a gem in the heaps of new books out this year. <br /> <br />The loved ones framing her own generation, one preceding and one following, leave the author standing alone to determine if she has learned enough about her heritage left by her mother, and what to do with lost hope, a most frightening unfairness of one's dearest pride, a bright and vibrant daughter's life cut short.   <br /> <br />In her prologue, she sets the stage as it was set for her: \\"That's how it started, Myrta's dementia and Cary's Multiple Sclerosis.  It crept into our lives and never let go.\\" Do I Know You? is a gift of wisdom for those who have not experienced such losses to seriously re-evaluate not only the transience of life but also the insight in knowing that dealing with it is about raw gut responses, then being left to question those decisions forever.  Suzanne Tilden-Mortimer pulls no punches.  Her story is about surviving.  She helps us so far; but seems to say, it's up to you now to face the next sunrise and to find new meaning for doing so. <br /> <br />Quick paced and throat gripping, the tempo of her language strips the expectations of packaged clichs of how we're \\"supposed\\" to deal with tragedy and how to move on.  Like a candid view of old war veterans privately sharing tormented memories, it's a revelation to those of us who have not been where she's been, and pray solemnly not to be.  It's a road home for those who have.  Most of all, it's a valuable lesson about patience, love, and endurance; about gripping the rope of life with bloodied hands and hanging above the abyss of breaking down, never to return.  A must read.  <br />	2005-10-11

Collis Tremayne, is determined to become a member of the Liar's Club, a secret government agency of spies.  At the top of his training class, Collis' only competition is the former house-maid Rose Lacey.  Rose is clever, brave, and seemingly immune to Collis' legendary charm.  As his frustration with Rose grows, so does his desire for her.<br /><br />When Rose Lacey is given the chance to better herself and become a spy for England's Liar's Club, she works tirelessly to meet the challenge.  Infuriated with the ease in which Collis achieves success and his arrogant confidence, Rose works even harder to best him while fighting her increasing attraction for her high-born competitor.<br /><br />When their rivalry gets out of hand, the pair are assigned a secret mission to test their skills and ability to work together.  Facing a dangerous threat to England's security, Collis and Rose must use all of their skills to outwit and thwart the enemy.  Can Collis and Rose work together without their tempers and passions exploding?<br /><br />I have read every book in the Liar's Club and enjoyed them all. The Charmer is no exception. Rose may be common by birth, but her driving desire to better herself makes her a strong, yet sympathetic, heroine. In addition, she has beauty, intelligence, and determination.  It's no wonder Collis is drawn to her.  Collis is charming, witty, and handsome. Despite his position in society, he doesn't let societal strictures rule his heart. These characters are a perfect balance for each other.<br /><br />I found the plot full of intrigue, the characters compelling, and the dialogue witty. I especially loved the amusing scenes involving the Prince Regent. Celeste Bradley does an excellent job of infusing sparkling humor into her books.<br /><br />While The Charmer can be read as a stand alone book, I would recommend reading the series in order. I love how character's from previous books cross over into The Charmer. A delightful read, I recommend The Charmer and the entire Liar's Club series.<br /><br />Annabelle<br /><br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewedcommend The Charmer and the entire Liar's Club series. <br /> <br /> <br />Annabelle <br />Reviewed for Joyfully Reviewed <br />	2005-10-11

A book club choice I'd not heard of, I looked forward to it because I'd never read Oates (caveat: I'm not much into fiction), though I certainly am aware of her reputation.  The subject was absolutely a surprise, especially given the publication date and an author of repute.  I remember the event well and would sooner expect to see a story like this headlined in the rags next to the checkout counter at the supermarket. <br /> <br />Frankly I don't see the worth of it.  It's a short read and easy enough, but I am seeing very little depth in it.  The senator is a shadowy character seen only through the eyes of the girl, the girl's most important quality seemingly her sexual proclivities.  We learn very little else about her in the book, even though it's written from her perspective.  She had her (most recent?  longest?  most fulfilling?) sexual relationship with G----, as he is identified in the book.  What, they think we might know him?  Better than we know who The Senator is?  Most of the book takes place in the car, in the water, the girl dies over and over and over again. <br /> <br />Not for me, however, soon or definitively enough. <br /> <br />Oates gives me more credit than I deserve.  More, she, and the publisher of this little tome, think me more curious about such things than I am. <br /> <br />I've read several novels lately - McEwan's The Atonement, Puzo's The Family come to mind - and have been reconsidering my position.  This one has reminded me why so much fiction leaves me so cold.	2005-10-11

Perhaps foremost as a close psychological profile of an incredibly charming and manipulative sociopath who was in his heyday among the top hit men for the Mob. But also as a family memoir, a story of attempting to get at the truth of the \\"bad seed,\\" in face of a good deal of understandable denial on the part of an interesting cast of extended family.  And finally, most simply, as a page-turning piece of true-crime investigation-I lost track of the dead bodies midway through the book-set in New York and New Jersey in the 50's and 60's, a wild, colorful, and now almost forgotten time.  The historical materials, the interviews with the hit man in jail, and the psychological musings of the author are intertwined in a way that kept me reading.  Recommended.	2005-10-11

This book delivers all three on more than one occasion.<br /><br />Meet Carlotta, a girl of \\"blessed flesh\\" who incurs the wrath of horrible insults yet is strong enough to fling them right back. Carlotta lives on Whisper Mountain with her \\"father-in-heart,\\" Franklin Thomas, a man so candid and heartfelt that you hardly notice his missing teeth and chain smoking. Carlotta's mother is traveling throughout the course of the novel in an effort to sell her own hand-crocheted Easter bunnies.<br /><br />Carlotta is in the throes of writing a romance novel when her strangely likable nemesis, Andrea, who is also writing a romance novel, steals Carlotta's heroine's main man. In real life, Carlotta is in love with Pete. Her romance plan to capture Pete's heart involves a complicated date with the inclusion of a group of people of whom Carlotta apparently loathes.<br /><br />Kathleen Jeffrie Johnson creates a flawed cast of characters who are all seemingly struggling with love and friendship but doing so incognito, behind caustic attitude and pomp. What's so lovely about this book is that even the characters we're not really suppose to like are likable, lovable, even. I laughed throughout the book and was touched in many parts by Carlotta's strength, loyalty and insight.<br /><br />An incredible book offering teens an unadulterated look at love and hatred and the wry possibility that those two lines can actually intersect. The language is raw and real. \\"Laugh-out-loud\\" funny but so thoughtfully written that there's no doubt you will find your sympathies and joy producing a tear.<br /><br />A must read. This is the first book I've read of Jeffrie Johnson's but one that has spurned me to fill my shopping cart with her other titles.	2005-10-11

It presents the origins of instrumental class teaching in this country, which by the evidence offered, goes much further back than is commonly believed. Accordingly the first recorded instance of instrumental class teaching goes back to Boston in 1800, almost a hundred years before the Maidstone movement in England which is commonly believed to be the forerunner of our class teaching system.  We learn that the Benjamin family established free violin schools in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Camden and Pittsburgh during the second half of the 19th century. Earnst Weiss, as associate of the Benjamin family, introduced free violin schools in Chicago. <br />The book also presents a detailed list of class methods for strings published prior to 1951. <br />	2005-10-11

While I was disappointed with some of Tita's decisions, I felt that Esquivel remained true to her character's personality and desires; she portrayed emotion using original descriptions and comparisons, often related to food (i.e. falling in love is compared to dough being dipped in hot oil).

I can relate wholeheartedly with the situations and examples provided in this book.  Despite what a couple of the reviews claim, this book is not about abusing your children.  In fact, there are several sections that give techniques on how to be more attentive, positive, and involved with your children.  My child has been controlling the house for years and every bit of the book's description of the behaviors and motivators of defiant children fit perfectly.  Many of the ideas in the book are similar to \\"Love and Logic\\" concepts, but this book expands on them.  For example, it expands the concept of logical consequences by breaking them down into three well-defined categories and gives practical ideas for coming up with consequences when you just can't think of an appropriate one.  With \\"Try and Make Me!\\", I have finally begun to take back control without yelling, screaming, arguing, or punishing.  Boy was my kid surprised.	2005-10-11

The characters are clich, the plot laughable, the dialogue patronizing and from a technology standpoint, he completely misses the boat.  Both the main characters are people so talented and gifted it's impossible to identify with them.  They're the perfect people just waiting to be a hero.

Robin Hobb, Shaman's Crossing (Harper, 2005)<br /><br />How do you follow up one of the strongest fantasy series of the last decade (which has been chock full of strong fantasy series)? If you're Robin Hobb, you turn around, walk the other way, and completely start over in a whole new world. (One does, however, wonder if the land east over the Barrier Mountains will turn out to be the Six Duchies.)<br /><br />Shaman's Crossing is the first of a trilogy featuring Nevare Burvelle, son of a soldier recently elevated to noble status. The first hundred-ish pages of the book take us through parts of Nevare's childhood, as he prepares to go to the Royal Academy at Old Thares to learn the ways of the cavalla (think \\"cavalry\\" here) to follow in the footsteps of his father. The rest of the book deals with Nevare's first year at the Academy-- the friendships and rivalries formed amongst the cadets, how the social life of the academy mirrors the mounting tension between old and new nobles in Old Thares, and laying groundwork for what's probably going to come in books two and three.<br /><br />Robin Hobb's books tend to start slowly, and Shaman's Crossing is no exception. As usual, however, the pace picks up as the book goes on. It doesn't pick up all too much, though, and a number of critics have come down on the book for being too slow. It does rather seem as if Hobb spends a lot more time in this book on setup, rather than allowing setup to flow naturally through the story (as happened in Assassin's Apprentice or Ship of Magic). That said, there's also a good deal more to set up; while many of the aspects of the life and culture of Gernia are the same sorts of things that were present in the life and culture of the Six Duchies, Hobb is obviously going to go into a lot more detail on them here. Fitz was always something of a loner, and only cared about political intrigue as it directly affected him. Nevare is a whole different sort of animal, who's forced to care about the intricacies of such things not only because he's in the thick of them, but because he's been born and bred to the task. There's a lot less action to be found in Shaman's Crossing than in any of Hobb's Six Duchies books, so be warned.<br /><br />This has the potential to be another fantastic series from the pen of Robin Hobb; I eagerly await the second book to see where things are going to go. ****he intricacies of such things not only because he's in the thick of them, but because he's been born and bred to the task.

Can you all feel the anger, so perceptible, in some of the reviews posted on this page? No doubt that they were written by true believing Mormons. I find it hilarious when they refer to their holier-than-thou Hugh Nibley? Who was Hugh Nibley outside of Utah? He was NOBODY! No real scholars outside the Mormon Church ever took him seriously. As for the people who really want to find out a little more about the Mormon corporation, I recommend the book \\"Leaving the Saints\\" by Hugh Nibley's daughter. In that book she explains in details what kind of man he was (he was one of those men who rape their daughters!). Furthermore, it is a very well written book - a real page turner! <br />Fawn M. Brodie's book is very well researched and has been acclaimed by scholars throughout the world. She was a real Professor, who worked for a real university. She was not one of those puppets who teach at BYU. Joseph Smith was a sick man and there are tons of documents that prove it.  <br />The Mormon Church was founded to make easy money and it still does today. Why do you think that the Mormon missionaries are instructed to wait until the last minute to talk to their prospective converts about the law of tithing (giving 10% of your income to the Mormon corporation)? I feel bad for its members and I pray God that he may bless them. <br />	2005-10-11

The strongest new character, David, was a fascinating character that I thought could have used more attention.  Prince Omar's character was too clich for me, and the ending of this book seemed to be too abrupt (I think Flynn realized he was coming up on the 500 page mark :-)).  This book really does not add anything to the series' story line, and it could be skipped.  I guess that is unacceptable to me as I enjoy every time I crack a Flynn book.  This is the weakest of the series, but it is still a good read for the genre.	2005-10-11

Though not an academic, she has developed a reputation for impartial, well considered, very well written prose. Here she oversees the contributions of a number of well-regarded historians, including John Gillingham, Neville Williams, Maurice Ashley, and John Clarke, each covering the dynasty in which they are expert. While this volume is primarily a collective royal biography, and therefore largely outside the scope of this bibliography, Fraser (presumably) has seen to it that the separate chapters emphasize the continuity of the Crown, even during periods of violent dynastic change. J. P. Brooke-Little, the Richmond Herald, also contributes occasional pages regarding the development of heraldry as displayed by England's monarchs.	2005-10-11

So far, this book has garnered only five-star reviews, and I absolutely agree with all the raves the other reviewers have given this book. I bought it for a research project along with quite a number of other food history books, and this is probably the best of the lot. It's more than history and facts - yes, it teaches you more than you ever wanted to know about ice cream, but it's fun and entertaining at the same time. The pictures and graphics are fantastic, and make the whole reading experience extremely enjoyable. The book is crammed full of the most interesting facts from what must be hundreds of different sources (for example: Did you know that your favorite flavor may indicate what your personality is like? Or did you know that there is a portable non-electric ice cream maker that makes ice cream after being attached to any moving object or person for forty minutes?)There is also a complete history of ice cream, ice cream recipes, reviews of top ice cream shops, and much, much more. Plus, if you haven't had enough at that point, there's even a bibliography in the back for you to find even more information about ice cream.  <br /> <br />My only complaint about this book is that it gave me VERY intense cravings for ice cream - not good for my diet!!!	2005-10-11

Even though I have a good graphic designer, I like to come up with the design and color schemes myself, and let him play around with them to get the best results. <br />Actually, before I worked with him, I had first one absolutely awful designer, and then another mediocre one. The first one designed my first book cover based on my design specs, which was OK, but she chose the colors, and I went along with her, not knowing any better. The results were pretty bad - the cover was way too dark, and some of the writing actually got lost in it because it was so dark. <br />That's when I switched over to my second designer, and picked up this gem of a book at the same time. I personally chose the color combos for the second and third books based on the combinations given in the book. Now, the design was basically the same for the first, second, and third covers because they were all part of the same set, but the colors make all the difference. I actually have buyers telling me how attractive the colors on the second and third books are, which is pretty amazing considering that they are just students' workbooks and cover design is usually not considered very important by my audience. I have since used this book for two more covers in the series with excellent results. <br />In short, if you are looking for inspiration for truly super color combinations, and want to see how the colors will actually look in print before the printing takes place, I highly recommend this book!	2005-10-11

Tyson who returns to his rural hometown of  Swamp Creek, Arkansas after a ten-year hiatus.  Tyson left behind an abusive father, emotionally detached mother, sullen older brother and a loving younger sister, Cynthia.  T.L. adored Cynthia and she was his reason for living and wanting something better than his humble, backwoods beginning.  It is because of his sister that he is now returning home after completing ten years of higher education and receiving a Ph.D. in Black Studies-which leaves his father wondering why he wasted good money on learning about Black Folks-when he could have told him everything he needed to know!  His sister,who was not even 10 when he left home,was his pride and joy, childhood friend, spiritual confidante and was his only reason for wanting to stay connected to folks who obviously had no commitment to him.  However, ten years is a long time to be gone and to have very little contact with family, so much to his surprise and chagrin, he learns upon returning home that his sister is gone-she died.  No one notified him of  her untimely death and no one wants to talk about it nor tell him how she died.<br /><br />In his tantrum and angry quest to find out what happened to Cynthia, T.L. will rip open the dysfunctional fabric that holds his family together.  He will discover that the glue that seals them together includes generational secrets, incest,  adultery, emotional annihilation and self-hatred.  Going home will also bring him face to face with his favorite teacher who is dying and who has a few secrets of her own.  She also has a demanding request of T. L. that he is not sure that he can honor. Since returning home, the baggage of the past is suffocating him and stifling his reason for being-and now that his sister is gone he is in more of a hurry to return to his beloved NYC.  But can one ever really emotionally or physically leave the place they call home?<br /><br />They Tell Me of a Home is a powerful, universal story of a young man returning home and coming to the realization that  \\" my coming home was because I had missed the most critical lesson any student can learn-that transforming the world begins with love of one's own people.\\"  Black delivers a poignant message as we journey with T.L. and he discovers that just maybe being from Swamp Creek isn't so bad and drives home  an even greater message that many folks of color still need to hear today-\\" that until we teach ourselves, we will always hate ourselves' -and continue to run away from the situation rather than to deal with what ails us.<br /><br /> Filled with wit, wisdom, social messages, folklore and rural southern black folk and their ways, Tyson's debut novel is creatively crafted and a page-turner.  Beautifully and lyrically written, colorful characters including secondary characters that felt like family and  inclusion of my two favorite topics-African American History and religion quickly moved this read into my Top 10 for 2005.  Anyone who has ever spent time in the South or still has family there will identify with at least one of the characters in the story.  They remind us of folks that we would  not choose if given a choice but because of blood relations these are the same folks that we lovingly and sometimes grudgingly call family.

Now he's done it again, distilling years as a player and designer of wargames into Hot Lead.  Jackson has found the essence of miniatures gaming and given it the same flexibility found in GURPS.  Hot Lead distills minatures gaming down to a pure form; nothing extraneous creeps in.  If brevity is the soul of wit, Hot Lead is the wittiest miniatures rules set available.  As proof that the rules have been carefully considered and constructed, I challenge any gamer to pick any rule in Hot Lead and say that it was poorly designed.   If the game has any apparent weakness, it's that nothing is repeated.  Some people prefer their rules repeat important details to help drive them home.  In practice this is not a real problem for Hot Lead.  The system is so elegant that it's easy to remember all of the important elements.  If you do need to check something, you'll find it a snap to look up anything you need that is in the rules; truly a testiment to the great organization.  Everything you might want to look up in the rules is well indexed.	2005-10-11

Part of its interest lies in Brahms himself; any book that purports to shed even a bit of light on so enigmatic a figure would cause one to turn pages in hopes of illumination. But I can imagine, too, a very dull book about Brahms. Well, there are few dull pages among the 600+ in Swafford's biography. As is now de rigueur in good modern historical writing, Swafford creates a judicious blend of primary-source material and commentary thereon, along with a rich store of anecdotes told in his own fine, writerly voice.    Musical analysis is treated in such a way that the amateur musician, and even the musically challenged, will not be put off. In all cases, Swafford demonstrates well one of his chief theses--that Brahms was the most Janus-like of the great nineteenth century composers. He looked back all the way to Renaissance masters, assimilating their contrapuntal styles in ways beyond anything that Beethoven, Mendelssohn, or Schumann had done before him. Yet he so thoroughly anticipated the ambiguity of tonality and rhythm in twentieth-century music that Schoenberg could, long after Brahms's death, speak of \\"Brahms the Progressive.\\"    But there is much more than musical analysis in this book. There is a thorough investigation of the many dualities in Brahms's nature: Brahms the generous, Brahms the curmudgeonly; Brahms the respecter of (intellectual and artistic) women, Brahms the misogynist; Brahms the romantic, Brahms the classicist; Brahms the sentimentalist, Brahms the cynic; Brahms the self-effacing, Brahms the monumentally egotistical. Swafford presents them all in their staggering incompatibility. And while Swafford himself admits that no one can ever quite hope to reconcile all these manifestations or indeed fill in the gaps in a life that the composer himself hoped to keep mostly a closed book, he comes close to making this great study in contrasts that was Brahms into a flesh-and-blood individual whose most mystifying acts seem almost comprehensible because we have seen him in action in similar contexts. By an exhaustive examination of the primary literature and shrewd speculation based thereon, Swafford builds a picture that convinces. He can't make us always like Brahms or even sympathize with him, but we come to understand him better through Swafford's portrait than we ever thought we could. That is some accomplishment.    Beyond this are the passages in which Swafford speaks of musical and indeed cultural history after Brahms. The epilogue to this book, in which the author traces Brahms's paradoxical legacy through the great century of change since his death, should be mandatory reading for all students of culture in the West.    Are there flaws? Yes. Some parts of the book show haste while others show careful crafting. In a work this large, that is to be expected. And Swafford overuses the word \\"magisterial.\\" This may describe Brahms to a tee, but so, I hope, do a few other adjectives. Small gripes? Small indeed, given the wealth of insight and reading pleasure that Swafford provides here. I'm ready for his biography of Ives!	2005-10-11

This story opens in the past as a teenage girl, Tara Mitchell, is running for her life in the mansion of a friend.  She and her two friends were to have a sleepover but something has gone terribly wrong and someone is after her and she doesn't know why.  The opening chapter closes as she is brutally murdered.<br /><br />Vince Capra, the Mayor of Pawley's Island informs his fairly new Police Chief, Joe Franconi, that a TV crew is setting up in the old mansion and he wants them out of there!  The Mayor feels the publicity about a 15-year old murder/disappearance of 3 teenage girls will be bad for their tourist season starting the next month, June.  Joe is an ex-vice cop from New Jersey who was wounded and seems to have left the force under a cloud so he settled in the \\"peaceful\\" town to recover and reduce his stress.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Nicole (Nicky) Sullivan, a TV reporter for Chicago's \\"Twenty-four Hour Investigates\\", has returned home to help herself, her show's ratings and her mom.  Nicky's mom is Leonora James, a renowned psychic and medium.  It is the 15 year anniversary of the death of Tara Mitchell and the disappearance of her two friends.  Nicky has persuaded her mom to walk through the house with the TV camera in the live portion of her show.  Nicky's family is rather eccentric to say the least as it consists of her mom, her mom's third husband, her Uncle Ham, Uncle John, and her older sister, Livvy who is 7 months pregnant and separated from her two-timing husband plus various assistants and so on.<br /><br />Leonora tells Nicky she is \\"blocked\\" and doesn't want to go on TV, but Nicky persists and brings her mom and the gang to the mansion where her TV crew awaits.  Leonora is able to view what happened to Tara Mitchell and at the end of the broadcast, real screams are heard although no one knows the source.  Nicky follows Karen, one of her crew, who she thinks she sees outside on her cell phone.  Nicky herself is hit on the head and cut and dragged under the trees where she sees Karen's body.  She is rescued just in time by Joe and others who were on their way down the drive.  After this extremely close encounter with a murderer, Nicky is contacted by the murderer by phone and by email and for Nicky and the police, the hunt is on.<br /><br />I loved Nicky's crazy family and also Joe's friend Dave and his pig Cleo and Joe's \\"friend\\", Brian.  I felt Ms. Robards did an excellent job portraying the evil in this story that is involved in so many ways.  Some people might thing there was a mishmash with the mystery, romance, comedy, suspense and paranormal but I felt the author did a good job pulling it together.	2005-10-11

Gortner's \\"The Secret Lion\\" does just that.   <br /> <br />The pace is quick (which is a refreshing contrast to some of the more ponderous and meandering historical authors who will remain nameless) and the characters lively.  I was a little disappointed that the homoerotic tension between Dudley and Prescott never really played out... <br /> <br />But all in all I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  The contrasting depictions of Mary and Elizabeth seemed both historically accurate and perhaps a bit more deftly nuanced than many fictional recharacterizations that I have read. <br />I am eagerly awaiting the sequel, and have passed my copy of this book along to friends for their enjoyment. <br />	2005-10-11

He points out that slavery existed long before the U.S. was a country and - contrary to liberal rants - in many non-Western countries.  Actually, the U.S. was the first country to begin outlawing slavery and has used it's influence in the world to outlaw it in other countries.  He also points out that more blacks sold blacks into slavery than white people ever did.   <br />His discussion about the prosperity of Jews and the resultant anti-semitism was the best I've ever read.

I thought after all these years after the torndown of the BErlin Wall, this should be a book that provides a balanced outlook. But it is clearly not the case. Throughout the first half, all I came to read was the looting, rape, violence commited by the Ivans, as a matter of fact, essentially every chapter was just a repetition of the Soviets' violence, savagery and irrationality in the previous chapter, and there was not a single mention of good conduct (though I did believe these were few) on the part of Soviet soldiers, they were just labels, copies of one another. the author clearly did not offer a desctiption with a humane touch, he saw the soldiers from an abstract political view instead of a personal, man-to-man perspective. And if you don't know the context yourself, after reading this book, all you might think of is why did those Russian beasts continue to live? A book which resorts to stir up blinded emotion to promote itself when it should give an objective listing is definitely to be discredited. And in this book, it seems that the Germans are the poor, helpless, defenseless minions waiting for the onslaught of the barbarians from the east. Can you imagine this type of simple minded work was actually done by an adult? Where is the heroic defense of the common German soldiers, some of whom climbed into the turret of destroyed T-34s to fire upon his opponents? Where is the apprehension of a soviet soldier who had lost his way in the enemy's territory? And for God's Sake where are the fine maps that should've been there instead of some cheapy sketch? Too many missed points to hit a target.<br /><br />And the author provided many interesting accounts only later to be questioned for its creditability, like the German soldiers at the Pomerania line hadn't got a bath since December? I could imagine they rarely had hygiene access, but where did the author got this information?<br /><br />This book that titled Fall of Berlin, 1945 attracted me as if it was a vivid account of the street fight in Berlin itself. Yet half way through the book, I found myself attending a college lecture, WWII history (the first half of 1945), and the lecturer was a sociologist instead of a military expert. And his wife should be rather amused since he spent so many paragraphs sympathizing with the suffering women (the old rape, scream, cold, starvation, bruise theme). Do we have no ideas about what would happen at war? Be specific, Antony.<br /><br />If you want to read specificly about the battle of berlin, go get OSprey's series.

When a twelve-year old girl named Riley Benson moves with her family to her grandma's house for the summer, she soon realizes that it will be the summer of her life. Soon after arrival she finds a chest and a key. Inside she finds a couple of things but the one she likes the most is the seropia crystal necklace. She ventures around her house taking pictures. She goes into the woods and trips on a tree while taking the pictures and to her surprise the butterfly, squirrel, rabbit, fox, and deer she saw in her dreams speak to her and ask her to help them out. They tell her all about how they got there and about why they are there. The animals also tell her that they sent their king to earth to save him and that they need to find him before the evil Tirantus Pirate gets to him or he will be taken prisoner and all the other planets will turn evil. Her necklace glows brighter whenever the king gets closer and she finds out that the king could've taken the form of anything. She decides to help the animals and starts her search before she has to go back to her own house at the end of the summer.<br /><br />This book is awesome! It is very interesting and makes you want to know what happens next. I thought the characters were interesting but kind of like everyday people. I recommend this book to anyone in 3rd-7th grade.

A little over half the book is dedicated to his early life as a law school student, FBI agent, and US District Court judge, with somewhat less information than I would have expected from the title devoted to his tenure as head of the department. Freeh unmistakably has an ax to grind with former President Clinton taking shots on the Lewinski scandal, Whitewater, the Kobar towers investigation, and the Marc Rich pardon among other things. Clearly he is relating his personal perspective (who doesn't), but I found myself feeling somewhat sorry for him as he related his struggles to work for a boss he clearly found unappealing. There is fascinating insight into the inner-workings of the agency and some of the political challenges that law enforcement professionals must face when conducting their business but that portion of the book is a bit too short in my opinion. The writing is clear, the chronicle is easy to follow, and the overall narrative is pretty interesting yet I came away feeling a little unfulfilled. I certainly think it was worth the time to read though. I give this one a pretty good but not stellar rating.	2005-10-11

The Age of Apocalypse storyline (has it really been 10 years?) began when Professor Xavier's illegitamite son David \\"Legion\\" Haller traveled back in time to kill Magneto so his father's dream of human and mutant unity would come true.  Legion accidnetly killed Xavier, thus altering history forever.  In an era of no X-Men, Apocalypse took over America, and the only ones to oppose him are Magneto and his team of X-Men.  The alternate reality setting surprisingly worked out well, as heroes became villains (Cyclops, Beast, Havok), villains became heroes (Sabretooth), and classic characters were given apocalyptic (no pun intended) makeovers.  Marvel has decided to re-print the complete epic in seperate volumes, but sadly, Book 1 doesn't include any of the various 4-issue series' that replaced the regular X-books (Astonishing X-Men, Amazing X-Men, Weapon X, Factor-X, Generation Next, X-Calibre, Gambit & The X-Ternals, X-Man, etc.) but instead compiles various one-shots, a special X-Man issue, and the Blink mini-series among others.  As a previous reviewer stated, the AOA storyline should have been re-printed the way it was originally released, beginning with the intro X-Men: Alpha one-shot, the various series', and the finale X-Men: Omega, with the issues collected here scattered between.  The issues collected here aren't bad, including the Factor-X one-shot in which Cyclops meets his real father Corsair, with tragic results that really show how dystopian this alternate reality is.  All in all, if you missed these issues and were a fan of the storyline, you may want to give this a look, but it's up to you if it is worth laying down this much cash for it.	2005-10-11

She answers lot of unanswered questions in the previous Potter books and also managing to present us with more of additional questions. (SPOILER) The highlights of this book is the blossoming romance between Ron and Hermione. Also Harry and Ginny. Mrs. Rowling developing each characters so well.<br /><br />Some of you probably hate this book cause it still leave us with so many questions at the end of this book. That's the brilliant of Mrs. Rowling. If she answered all of the question now, there will be no surprise twist anymore in the final book. Not to mention we are not so eager to step in line for hours to buy the book the minute it been release so we can find the answers we hope for.<br /><br />Few questions that we are dying to know the answers in the seventh book are:<br /><br />1. Is Snape a member of  Lord Voldemort  team or not?<br /><br />My prediction: Not! He is still loyal to Prof. Dumbledore. Why? Simple enough. The bad team had more strong members compare to the good side. Snape probably the strongest wizard after Lord Voldemort and Dumbledore. It will be nice if Snape on the good side helping Harry although they dislike each other.<br /><br />2. Is the character who died in the sixth book really dead or not? My prediction : Unfortunately Yes. Why? Cause since the fourth books of Harry Potter, there was always one character dead.<br /><br />3. The most important question of all. Since book fourth, there was always one character dead. In Book 4, a character dead. Book 5, an important character dead. In Book 6 a VERY important character dead. So in Book 7, probably the most important character will die. The question is who? Harry or Lord Voldemort?<br /><br />And after I read all sixth of really good Harry Potter books, I am sure that Mrs. Rowling can write a real satisfying final book of this magnificent series.fying final book of this magnificent series. <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

The hero, the villain, and all supporting characters each have twisted lives of pain, despair, and antisocial behavior. Dr. Keith Ablow, in life a noted forensic psychiatrist, writes from the first person, and it is oddly refreshing to read a flawed, yet functioning main character navigate life's difficulties in spite of it all. Or perhaps because of it all. Frank Clevenger is established as a cocaine snorting, sex-addicted outlaw of the psychiatric profession, yet his calling is sublime: to heal the spirit of his patients.<br /><br />The imagery is raw, detailed, and spot on accurate. I've worked in medicine and the law, and only someone well acquainted with the real deal could write in such a convincing, accurate manner. Some of the characterizations and plot were a tad trite. Ablow tends to embrace the mythical archetypes and stereotypes (the good whore, the doughnut eating cop). On the whole, though this book is easy to read, and hard to put down. I finished it in one long night, and recommend it to anyone who wants a gritty, grimy, crime novel that will carry you well to the finish.	2005-10-11

This is one of the strangest short-story collections I have ever read.  Then again, I had come to expect that from the author of the brilliant short-fiction book The Girl in the Flammable Skirt.  Now Aimee Bender writes some rather dark, strange and disarming stories in Willful Creatures that will truly shock you and keep you thinking long after you finish reading each story.  The characters are nameless, unflinching in their actions and quite unlikeable, doing things that will repel and compel you at the same time.  From bad parents, shameless seducers and abusers who target upon the weak, this collection has it all.  My favorite stories are \\"The Leading Man,\\" \\"Debbieland,\\" \\"Dearth,\\" \\"The Meeting,\\" and \\"End of the Line.\\"  All of the stories are amazing, but the aforementioned ones stood out the most for me.  I marvel at Bender's writing style.  She reminds me a great deal of Amanda Filipacchi in that she mixes the outlandish with the mundane in an astonishing, hilarious twist.  Are you in the bargain for some literary and surreal short stories?  I recommend you read Willful Creatures.  And give The Girl in the Flammable Skirt a whirl while you're at it.	2005-10-11

This formalism was used for b) but not a).  The entire field has more or less dried up, since there has not been an explosion of protocols (that's a GOOD thing).	2005-10-11

I can't say for sure if this one or the one about the postman was worse, but either way, i have given up reading anything he writes.  If i could rate this book with less than one star, i would.  I picture the first seventy-five percent of this book written at his leisure, with very little interest other than for the money he would make when it got published.  The last twenty-five percent of the book, the finale, seemed rushed and contrived, written in a flash because his dead line was quickly approaching.  If a writer is going to write, he should have the decency to at least try his best.

We will always be happy, he argued, if we learn to desire that things should be exactly as they are.  After attaining his freedom, Epictetus spent his entire career teaching philosophy and advising a daily regimen of self-examination.  His pupil Arrianus later collected and published the master's lecture notes; the Enchiridion, or Manual, is a distillation of Epictetus' teachings and an instructional manual for a tranquil life.

His writing not only is in good English, but it's good writing! The story takes place in the spring of 1989, in China. Obviously, the reader is in a state of mounting suspense awaiting the eyewitness description of the massacres at Tiananmen Square which occurred on June 3-4. Ha Jin writes of these and of everyday things--food preparation, clothing styles, ancient poems, songs, and political events, as only a native Chinese could. His narrator, a graduate student at a provincial university, experiences the horrors of tending a deranged stroke patient--his professor and mentor--and hears the recollections the older man dredges up about the Cultural Revolution, a time of book-burning, persecution, and debasement of all intellectuals by the regime. There are also several side plots involving romance and political advancement at the expense of merit, a crude form of cronyism with which we are familiar in our own country.<br /><br />Ha Jin has managed to write in a style that reads as though it is a translation from Chinese to English, but obviously he wrote the book in English.

How dare you!<br /><br />J.R.R Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is one of those things that one is simply not allowed to dislike. Oh sure, you can voice your criticism, but to do so is to be labelled an ignorant, illiterate fool who would be better suited to reading children's stories than high fantasy. One can see this phenomenon right here at Amazon; simply look at all the negative reviews for Tolkien's work. No matter how well the reviewer articulated his or her thoughts, every negative review has a heaping of \\"Not Helpful\\" votes from people who cannot seem to grasp the idea that some people just don't like Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Knowing the kind of geeky following these books have and the sheer amount of snobbery surrounding them, I was instantly inclined to hate it, as I do with everything geeks worship to an obsessive degree. But instead I fought my preconceived notions and slogged my way through the entire Lord of the Rings with an open mind. After finishing it, however, I was left feeling distinctively unmoved. For the longest time, I could not think of what it was, exactly, about LOTR that I disliked. Clearly, it's easy to admire Tolkien for what he did. In creating Middle Earth, Tolkien not only created an entire world, he also created millenia of history to go along with it. He created different races, with different languages and customs. Looking at a map of Middle Earth, one can only imagine how much time and thought Tolkien put into this. The sheer amount of detail is mind-boggling.<br /><br />But why did I dislike it so? I'm not going to criticize Lord of the Rings because of its supposed racist undertones, or because the women have only minor roles, both of which are examples of projecting modern values onto a medieval fantasy world. No, the reason I found LOTR such a chore to read is Tolkien's writing style. To be honest, Tolkien's style of writing is dull, dry, humorless, pedantic, and needlessly ponderous. I had to fight through page after page of purple prose as Tolkien endlessly detailed every environmental detail and every geographical and historical facet of Middle Earth. As someone once put, Tolkien stresses the unimportant and trivializes the momentous. Take, for example, the Battle of Helm's Deep, or the Battle of Isengard. Tolkien presents these epic battles with all the grandeur and importance of grocery shopping.<br /><br />As a result, the pacing of LOTR is agonizingly slow. \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" is frontloaded to the extreme, dumping a huge quantity of information in the reader's lap right off the bat, and devoting page after page to exposition until something finally happens. The turgid pace eventually picks up slightly, but even then it remains dreadfully slow. The result is reading that is dry, disjointed, and downright confusing in places. Historical details of Middle Earth and strewn about with no regards to context, characters and events are elaborated on that bear no relation to the plot; it's all an exercise in wretched excess. LOTR reads like a dry historical account, although even historical accounts are free of the pointless tangents Tolkien insists on following.<br /><br />Characters, too, are likewise uninteresting. We never really get to know the innermost thoughts and drives of the people of LOTR; Tolkien keeps them at arms length and the result is detrimental. None of the dialogue sounds natural. Characters speak in a purely declarative manner, as if they were all about to pontificate on some matter of great importance. As I forced my way through, I came dangerously close to uttering the eight words that are the kiss of death for any novel: \\"I don't care what happens to these people\\". Having no particular interest in the characters, and finding Tolkien's exposition utterly boring, \\"Lord of the Rings\\" was a battle to finish.<br /><br />\\"Lord of the Rings\\" is a story that's easy to admire, yet very difficult to actually enjoy. It's the kind of thing that I would read simply to say I've read it, and then never read it again. I'm sure a Tolkien scholar could expound at great length about the sheer depth and content of these books, but many a reader will finding them tough going indeed. Be forewarned.g that I would read simply to say I've read it, and then never read it again.

I just love it!! <br /> <br />This book is set in the Lowcountry region between Georgia and South Carolina. The Gullah proverb: \\"If you don't know where you are going, you should know where you came from\\" is the basis of this book. Meridy Dresden finds herself at loose ends when her son, BJ, is off at college and her husband, Beau, is immersed in a trial that he has been working on for over two years. Meridy takes a trip home to Seaboro and not only was it a trip home, it was a journey to rediscover that young vibrant girl that she feared had died along with her best friend who died tragically the night they graduated from high school.  <br /> <br />Tulu, her former housekeeper and part nanny, shared with Meridy proverbs about the Gullah culture and shared with her some stories to help Meridy find her way back to having peace within her heart. Meridy embarks on that journey with fear and trepidation after all, it could ruin everything she has worked very hard for. <br /> <br />This book is written with lyrical prose and lovely scene-writing ~~ it makes me keep coming back for more. It was a soothing read too ~~ in today's frantic world, this book set a slower pace and made me sit and relax. It is about a woman embarking on self-discovery, her relationship with her mother and sister, best friend and husband. It is enlightening read and very emotional in spots. It is a book that I would recommend to everyone who loves reading this kind of book.

This view is called \\"historicism,\\" or sometimes \\"the fulfilled prophecy\\" interpretation, and takes the position that many of the key prophecies, such as the rise of the Antichrist, the Great Tribulation, and Daniel's 70th Week, have already been fulfilled.  <br /> <br />Over the years, I have done some research on the \\"fulfilled prophecy\\" position, but I was left with more questions than answers. Woodrow, however, has done an outstanding job of both explaining the position - marrying together scripture and historical fact - and anticipating readers' questions or rebuttals and responding to them in the text. Almost as soon as you say to yourself, \\"Yes, but what about...,\\" he anticipates the question and responds to it a few sentences later.  You may not always agree with his answers, but they are always well-reasoned, which is a welcome relief from much of the skin-deep scholarship we read today.  <br /> <br />The \\"fulfilled prophecy\\" view does not suggest that the Second Coming is also fulfilled, but it does separate the 70th Week, the Great Tribulation, the rise of the Antichrist, and other prophecies commonly accepted as future from the Second Coming. In this view, the Second Coming is the only prophecy yet to be fulfilled - thus fulfilling the prophecies that \\"no man knows the hour or the day\\" and that Jesus will return \\"as a thief.\\"  <br /> <br />While there are many elements to the fulfilled prophecy view that I struggle with, particularly certain imprecision in the fulfillment of Matthew 24 and Revelation, I acknowledge that this is a powerful presentation of an alternative view.  I do wish that Woodrow had covered Revelation and the fulfilled prophecy's position on these prophecies, but he did not.  <br /> <br />Still, as Woodrow has written, \\"Right or wrong...should we not at least inquire why these men [such as Wyclif, Huss, Luther, Calvin, Knox, Zwingli, Tyndale, Foxe, Newton, and Wesley] felt this way?\\" I agree. As true students of scripture, with open and humble hearts before the Lord, I believe that, when arguments are well presented, biblical, and historical, they should be considered. If we reject historicism in favor of futurism, let us do so with full knowledge of the scholarship and history behind this position.  <br /> <br />Therefore, even if one walks away disagreeing, at the very least, this book deserves a serious read.  <br /> <br />- H.

This book is just as great as any of his previous, but this time with four main characters in switching roles. Each character in this book is hillarious; The shunned former TV star, the troubled teenage girl, the washed up rock musician, and the mother of a retarded child. All four of this crazy suicide support gang found their way into my heart as i read chapter after chapter of Hornby's latest masterpiece. Nick Hornby is a modern day Jane Austen, packing crazy love tangles and humorous results into every page.	2005-10-11

Also, they DO provide a very detailed stroke order- I am puzzled why so many reviews comment that there is no stroke order.  Perhaps there was an earlier edition?  I will take and upload a photo, so other customers can see for themselves.    I find them superior to \\"Chinese Character Flashcards 888\\" and wish I would have saved my money as I purchased both sets. There is another review comparing them that is incorrect.  These flashcards are more sturdy, have a more detailed stroke order (they break down every single stroke while the 888 set often groups them), provide a sample sentence as well as additional words using the character (888 only has a few sample words), and provide the traditional character along with the simplified when applicable (888 does too, but it's very small).  They are superior in every way to the 888 set- I haven't even looked at the other set since the Tuttle set arrived.  In fact, this is the first Amazon review I've written, and I do so to correct the misinformation I based my purchasing decision upon.    Another useful feature is that the first 500 flashcards in the set coincide exactly with the two Tuttle Language Library volumes \\"250 Essential Chinese Characters\\".  So, if you're working your way through these books, these flashcards are the ideal study aid.  (The labeling numbers coincide exactly...if learning character number 115 in the book, you can refer to flashcard 115.)    I am very happy with the cards and encourage their use as part of a well-rounded study program.  It has been commented that individual characters have no real \\"meaning\\", so these cards have limited use.  I disagree.  Individual characters do have meaning and are used to represent a particular sound and tone.  You must learn what sound goes with which character since characters are written individually with equal spacing- when reading Chinese, you need to pronounce each sound as you go along since characters are not grouped together to signal they are being used to build a particular word.  Thus, each character needs to be learned individually since it can be used with many different characters to build different words.  For example, \\"pengyou\\", meaning \\"friend\\", is written with two characters: one representing the sound \\"peng\\" (which means friend) and one representing \\"you\\" (which also means friend).  But the character for \\"you\\" can also be combined with the character for \\"yi\\" which result in \\"youyi\\", meaning \\"friendship\\".    As far as the samples sentences go, they may potentially be confusing since they do not provide an exact word-for-word translation, but for someone with moderate experience (I've been studying Mandarin for 3 months now) they are very easy to understand.  An exact translation wouldn't be very comprehensible anyway.  I rarely find myself confused over which word represents which meaning, and if uncertain, it's easy enough to look up a troublesome word in the dictionary.  It's all part of the learning process.	2005-10-11

That aside decided to give it a go and found that it has ebbs and tides.  There were times when I couldn't wait to get back into the novel at night because I thought the story line perplexing.  Then there were times when it seemed as though I might get sick because of forced dialogue and boring interactions.  I did think the book propelled me into the second novel without hesitation.

Robert Jordan was born in 1948, served two tours in Vietnam receiving multiple medals. He started to write in 1977, and he vowes to continue writing \\"until the last nail is hammered to his coffin\\". God bless him in longevity!  <br /> <br />This epic fantasy, the 11th of the series is the book that the fans have been waiting for despite the 2003 title \\"Crossroads of Twilight\\" (Wheel of Time, Book 10). The early editions set the stage in the Tolkien tradition, giving Jordan the writer's credibility and audience. His vivid imagination has enabled him to snake through another complicated, multi-character plot with intrigue and suspense  that rightly belongs to another world. The march to the final battle, or so it seems, builds up the excitement Jordan had warned...though admittedly no sweating. <br /> <br />The theme progressively narrows on Mat, Perrin, Egwine, and Elayne, as finally Mat becomes the Prince of Ravens, when \\"she\\" marries him -- and he wonders how he had \\"bloody become one of them\\" considering his distaste of nobility.  <br /> <br />While anticipated, it's a bit of surprise, that the 11th book would not conclude the series...well, perhaps not..and it is a good thing if it doesn't...as there is more steam awaiting  this writer. <br /> <br />The reading is easy but requires concentration, particularly if not familiar with Jordan's previous books or his style of references. Many of his statements are unique, such as: \\"...smiled, but it slid off her face under Jolin's stare...\\" or the profound statement \\"...flaming sons of goats...\\"  <br /> <br />This is a literary achievement worthy of partaking.      <br /> <br />	2005-10-11

Again Robin Hobb does an excellent job at developing her world and the plot advances are well paced and flow very well. This is a story of adventure, but also of duty, love, and pain. The main character, Fitz, continues to draw the reader in as one experiences his adventures and feels the very human drama of his choices. Interestingly, I found that it was the human pain that makes the character so real. Several times I stopped to ponder whether I wanted to continue. And despite the tragedy of the plot, I continued to read hoping, wishing that Fitz would surmount the obstacles and come out complete. This book left me stunned with sorrow. A great read from a great author. If you want to read a series that is memorable for the sense of adventure but also for great character development and the chance to vicariously experience another life - and hopefully learn from it, then grab a copy of this book. I highly recommend this and the other 5 books in this series.	2005-10-11

The book is a great contribution to the history of the innovative stormtroop tactics, how they came to prominence, what kind of problems they solved and why the Germans were the first among the belligerents to find such revolutionary solutions. The focus of the book is not so much on assault battalions but on their tactics, although the various personalities are well covered. Gudmundsson presents also some examples of battles on the Western and Eastern Front (First Ypres, Cambrai, Kaiserschlacht, Riga, Caporetto etc.) in a clear and fascinating way and gives ample evidence of the good results that the German Army reaped from its new doctrine. I found most interesting the part about the nature of German delegation of authority and the culture of personal iniative cultivated among the NCOs and the junior officers. It is one of the best force multipliers ever conceived! There are no photographs in the book, only a few diagrams and also a few primitive and rather crude maps, but the text is worth the money.	2005-10-11

E.g., a reader may want a coffee-table Bible, a devotional Bible, or a study Bible.  The reader may want a Bible that gives the interpretation of a passage (regardless of the passage's literal language); or, the reader may want the Bible to translate the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic accurately, and to make up his or her own mind about the passage's meaning.  One reader may be distressed if language favors the male gender; another reader may be distressed if the publisher changes the Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic canon text to make language more gender-neutral.<br /><br />This review assumes the reader wants an Updated NASB Bible.  The Updated NASB Bible: (i) translates the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic literally; and (ii) follows the canon text with respect to gender.  If the reader wants a Bible that gives a passage's interpretation, rather than the passage's literal translation, that reader may be happier with a Message Bible (or similar Bible), which gives a modern paraphrase of the literal translation.  If the reader wants gender-neutral language, the reader may be happier with a New Revised Standard Version, which uses inclusive pronouns.<br /><br />First, the pluses of the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible.<br /><br />This Bible is beautiful.  The leather is of excellent quality.  The gold leaf is flawless.  The pages are neatly-arranged, and the arrangement renders the Bible very user-friendly.  The print is somewhat larger than the print of competing study Bibles, making the Scofield Bible more convenient for those with poor eyesight.<br /><br />Second, the minuses.<br /><br />Where New Testament language quotes a passage from the Old Testament, the NASB translation emphasizes the reference by using a different typeface: small capitalized letters.  This is an excellent feature.  However, inexplicably, Scofield rarely identifies the Old Testament passage that is being quoted.  The reader is left frustrated, knowing that the small-caps language quotes an Old Testament passage, but with no convenient way to locate the passage being quoted (forcing the reader to do what I am doing: have both a Scofield Study Bible and a Zondervan Study Bible in front of him or her, and read the two together-a time-consuming, bulky, and expensive method that calls into question the rationale for buying the Scofield Bible in the first place).<br /><br />Also, the quality of Scofield's footnotes varies wildly.  I bought the Scofield Bible because I compared its notes on one particular topic with the notes of competing Bibles, and found Scofield's notes to be more helpful than the others.  I assumed that Scofield's superiority on that one topic would carry through the rest of the Scofield Bible.<br /><br />That assumption was incorrect.<br /><br />Some text that desperately needs extensive footnoting has little or none (which is probably how Scofield could produce a study Bible about the same size as a comparable Zondervan Study Bible but with larger print).  As one example, Scofield has four notes in Mark explaining the Olivet Discourse; Zondervan has 29.<br /><br />Some notes are poorly-written.  As one example, the note describing Judas Iscariot in connection with Matthew 26:14 says Judas was \\"One of the twelve disciples of Jesus who betrayed Him.\\"  The note implies that there were more than 12 disciples, 12 disciples betrayed Jesus, and Judas was one of the 12 who betrayed Him.  The note should read (simply to be grammatically correct, and without regard to the additional information the note would need in order to be more nearly accurate and complete), \\"One of the 12 disciples of Jesus; the disciple who betrayed Him.\\"<br /><br />Some footnotes contain interpretations that are simply incorrect.  As one example, recall the Parable of the Landowner.  In that parable, a landowner walls off his property, installs a grape press, and leases the property to vine-growers.  The landowner sends a slave to collect the rents; the vine-growers beat him and send him on his way, empty-handed.  The same scene is repeated multiple times; the vine-growers beat some of the slaves, and kill others.  Finally, the landowner sends his son.  The vine-growers kill the son.  Plainly, the landowner in the parable is God.  The slaves are the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist.  The landowner's son is Jesus.  The vine-growers are the Pharisees (and presumably the Sadducees and Herodians).  But, the note to Mark 12:1 maintains that \\"the vine-growers . . . are the O.T. prophets and John the Baptist.\\"  I.e., according to the note, the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist-not the Pharisees (and Sadducees and Herodians)-persecuted Jesus and caused him to be crucified.<br /><br />Scofield's sloppiness and errors, such as those described in the examples above, render its notes on less-clear parables, discourses, and other material highly suspect.<br /><br />In short, while the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible may have some usefulness in one's library, and is certainly beautiful, the serious student would be better off buying a Bible with better references, more notes, and better note scholarship.<br />_______________rowers beat him and send him on his way, empty-handed.

While Lipset contrasts late-twentieth-century America as a whole with other modern nations, Dworkin measures the dominant character type in America today (the \\"imperial self\\" or \\"expressive individualist\\") against ideal typical personas in various civilizations at key moments in their development: the crumbling Roman empire of Augustine, medieval European aristocratic society, Tocqueville's America, and the United States of the 1950s \\"organization man.\\" The most intriguing aspect of Dworkin's project is how useful the categories of Augustinian psychology turn out to be in analyzing the ethos of diverse societies throughout history. <br /> <br />Dworkin is quite successful in substantiating his claim that \\"there is nothing new under the sun.\\" We can use to great advantage Augustine's notions about true peace, detachment, time horizon, self-love, and faith in the transcendent to sort out the struggles of democracy and aristocracy or postmodernism and the therapeutic ethos, just as the author of the City of God did in defending orthodox Christianity against Manicheism, Donatism, Platonism, and Gnosticism. Even our current \\"culture wars\\" have been played out before, albeit in proxy form. <br /> <br />Intriguingly, Dworkin's argument can be interpreted as a refutation of those (such as Lipset) who contend that there is something truly new and exceptional about America. In fact, the early American character described by Tocqueville with such admiration was separated from its aristocratic forebears of the ancien regime by three psychological factors (the republican principle, the force of public opinion, and the salience of Christian faith) which, Dworkin observes, have proven fragile amidst the vicissitudes of late modernity. Once these sources of virtue and restraint are stripped away, the American character reveals its true self, hidden like a recessive gene. The imperial self which emerges is once again aristocratic and self-aggrandizing in nature. Barricaded in \\"lifestyle enclaves\\" against the imagined threats of any truly public life, this expressive individualist dissipates himself in pursuit of empty self-fulfillment, devoid of the transcendent principles which guided the lives of his ancestors. Tocquevillian virtue was a mere blip on the time-line. <br /> <br />Dworkin's analysis thus lends itself to a thoroughly pessimistic construal of the prospects of American life. No type of deliverance is possible because, as imperial selves, we engage in a systematic refusal to acknowledge dependence on the transcendent. We condemn ourselves to disappointment, so Dworkin hardly needs to utter an explicit word of judgment. Lipset, by contrast, carefully probes America's cultural inheritance in hope of discovering strategies to accentuate the virtuous face of the double-edged sword. His guarded optimism for America's moral future is bounded by the realization that we cannot escape the legacy of our established political culture. The communitarian approaches that appeal to many today are unlikely to take root in this liberty-loving soil. Realistic hopes for ameliorization rest with the development of a \\"moral individualism\\" consistent with dominant American values, but prescinding from the self-interested atomism which characterizes America in its worst moments. The distinctive American ethos is flexible, though not infinitely so.	2005-10-11

However, you can't but help notice some cliche that's been put in the story. Eragon and Saphira acted childish and foolish sometimes without us (the reader) being told or shown so. Also, Paolini could have improved his method of characterization throughout the story. He could have made Jeod into a more round character because he would become important later, but we really didn't get to know him, only that he is part of the Varden. This is not overanalyzing the story but rather just looking at where Paolini could have improved. You can't help but see this. I am surprised that Knopf published the book without catching these errors, even more so because the book was to be marketed to teens and older children. On the other hand, Eragon is a great book, especially since it was written by a 15-year old, not 17. The marketing of the book did not make it popular; many books have been advertised a lot and still turn out to be flops. What made this book popular was that it was a book that could not be put down. Nobody buys the second book (Eldest) unless he or she liked the first, so nobody can say the book is popular because of marketing. People like it because it's a good thriller/ imagination stimulator. It's just not a book that you can stop. Eragon could have been better, but that doesn't make me think that it's the worst book in the world like some other reviewers have pointed out.<br /><br />The major conflict that plays into the climax isn't introduced until about halfway through the book. By then your thinking that the conflict and the climax will be dealing with the Ra'zac, but no. I'm not telling who, but a new character is introduced halfway in the story and the entire story takes a left turn from there. If you've already read both Eragon and Eldest, then you know that the Ra'zac conflict will continue in Eldest, but no clues in Eragon give that away.<br /><br />One more point I'd like to make is in retaliation to another review written recently. What teenager wouldn't want to be published if given the chance? He or she would have a voice in the world, something few teenagers and young adults have. Being successful may be a matter of opinion, but I just don't buy the fact that not all teenagers want to be published. Getting published is the same thing as saying that your writing stands out above most other writings in the nation. You are now a nationally known celebrity. What teenager wouldn't want that?<br /><br />One more thing is that you have all these reviewers giving Eragon 5 stars when all they say is that its a really great book. Can anyone explain WHY it's a really great book? (Not just that it's a page-turner)<br /><br />The movie Eragon is set to release in July 2006.

I also learned a great deal about the character and life of her first husband, Joseph Smith. I am in awe of the challenges that Emma faced in her life, and how her commitment to her husband, God, and herself never wavered. I cannot imagine having to deal with what this remarkable woman endured. <br /> <br />I am a believing, practicing, and committed member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. If anything this book strengthened my understanding and faith as I learned a great deal more about how God uses imperfect people to accomplish his perfect work.

Hopefully what I have learned in this book allows me to be at least a small influence in changing that perception.	2005-10-11

I picked this book up a few days ago, and I finished it at warp speed.   <br /> <br />This is a book about the America's Cup races at the turn of the century between English and American teams of boat designers, sailors, and wealthy financial backers.  The author tells the story of each part of these teams, and it kept me glued.  Pastore does a really good job I think in telling this story.  He uses his own obvious sailing and sailboat expertise to recreate every detail of the enormous (at least for their day) vessels and their crews.  You get a sense for the danger involved and the what was at stake, and you can trust the author.  He is academic about the details, but his love for boats and sailing permeates.  The races took place over a hundred years ago, but he makes them exciting and you really don't know what's going to happen.  It's fun. <br /> <br />I have written reviews of fiction before, but never for non-fiction.  This book really grabbed my attention for some reason.  I don't think I will be alone.  The story works on so many levels....political, nautical, technological, economic.  I am giving this book for a christmas gift.  I feel confident that several members of my family will enjoy this story.	2005-10-11

Many people are often unaware of the colorful pasts of their own town.  That's why it's so great to have a publisher like Arcadia Press around.  Their specialty is publishing books about regional history and I was pleasantly surprised to see that the city in which I live is the subject of one of their outstanding books.<br /><br />I've always known that the City of Westland, and formerly Nankin Township had a long history and was an area that featured a large population of Indians back before settlers arrived in the early 1800's.  As a kid my friends and I rode the nature trails in Hines Park which had names like the Tonquish Trail.  Chief Tonquish was a Potawatomi Indian who was the leader of the tribe that lived along the banks of the Rouge River.  As more settlers began infringing on Indian lands it led to skirmishes between the two factions.  In one violent episode the Chief and his son were killed. A marker stands today at the site of Tonquishe's burial site.<br /><br />As with all of Arcadia's books, fantastic archival photography is included and it's always amazing to see these very old photos.  Included is a photo of the Reverend Marcus Swift, one of the area's earliest settlers who came to the area in 1825.  Swift is buried in Newburgh Cemetary, the oldest cemetery in the area.  One of the most famous buildings in all of Westland is the Nankin Mills building first built in 1863 and still standing today.  The build was purchased by the Ford Motor Co. in 1918 and used by them until 1947.  However most modern Westland residents remember it as the Nature Center which opened in 1958 as a local wildlife preserve.  This was a frequent field trip destination for local elementary schools throughout the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn so many facts about my town which I never knew.  Such as that it was Henry Ford who built the one room school house located at Farmington Rd. and Ann Arbor Trail, and later had a larger, full elementary school added on called Perrinville, which is where I went to school.  One of the great success stories of Westland is the Westland Mall.  Built in 1965 the mall continues to thrive at a time when other area malls have gone out of business or are struggling.<br /><br />This was a great trip down memory lane for me to revisit so many of places and sites that I frequented as a child and to learn about the history of my hometown.<br /><br />Reviewed by Tim Jansonool house located at Farmington Rd. and Ann Arbor Trail, and later had a larger, full elementary school added on called Perrinville, which is where I went to school.

Thomas Steele's definitive '1000 Clowns: More or Less: A Visual History of the American Clown' (2004) offers abundant evidence that professional clowning may represent the ultimate in alternative lifestyles.<br /><br />Though playful behavior is, of course, found in some higher animals, the human activity of professional clowning is always a highly artificial process enacted within a specifically structured framework, thus making the clown a legitimate, knowing, and complexly-organized insider who nonetheless often essays the role of eternal outsider.<br /><br />Clowns are 'betwixt and between' liminal creations whose behavior simultaneously reflects experience and innocence, callousness and sensitivity, seductiveness and repulsion, sincerity and deception. Whether performing in the center spotlight or merely acting as a diversion for another act, the clown is always on stage and constantly negotiating the space between the objective world of his audience and his own very private channels of perception, spontaneity, insight, and response. The truly successful clown becomes an autonomous personage, a \\"demigod of the sawdust\\" who subtly persuades his audience to forget the unknown human factor beneath the facade.<br /><br />The gorgeous visuals in '1000 Clowns'--which are categorized under \\"Photography,\\" \\"Film & Television,\\" \\"Paintings,\\" \\"Graphics,\\" \\"America's Clowns,\\" and \\"Clowns In Movies\\"--underscore the fact that those clowns that appear bizarre, repulsive, and grotesque, such as those that appear on pages 114-116, are typically those with badly designed or haphazardly applied makeup. The stronger the design, artifice, and illusion, the more attractive and desirable the clown; some historical examples presented here include Lou Jacobs, Harry Dann, Felix Adler, Emmett Kelley, \\"Chucko the Birthday Clown,\\" and baby boomer favorite Bozo.<br /><br />1000 Clowns wisely focuses on the classic high period of the American circus, which, uncoincidentally, also coincided with the high point of Twentieth Century American culture.also coincided with the high point of Twentieth Century American culture.	2005-10-11

However, as the two agents are drawn further into the search for answers, they find there is a larger evil at work.<br /><br />In Israel, an ancient society of antichrist supporters have raised up Luco Scaramuzzi to power.  Claiming he is the Antichrist, Luco has convinced the group to back him up in his crusade to become the ultimate authority - and evil- of the world.  He will stop at nothing to get what he wants.
