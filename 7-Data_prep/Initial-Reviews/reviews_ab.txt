Let the buyer beware: if you are a person who cannot or does not like to read really, really FINE PRINT, then this guide is probably not for you.  It has by far the tiniest print I have seen in a book - even smaller than the \\"Third Ear Guide to Classical Music\\" if you are familiar with that one.<br /><br />In my first look at this monster-of-a-guide, I could not get beyond this tiny print and the overly-plain visual layout.  But, with another long look, the value of this unique guide started to stand out clearly. There is a reason for such tiny print - to cram in an unbelievably vast amount of information in one volume.  The All Music Guide is enormously ambitious in what is contains:<br />o  BIOGRAPHIES of over 500 composers AND 800 performers (unprecidented in one volume)<br />o  Fairly detailed PROGRAM NOTES for an impressively large number of works (not just the major ones)<br />o  Listings of 2-6 RECOMMENDED RECORDINGS for each work (but no comparison or explanations of the choices like Penguin)<br />o  ESSAYS on the major musical periods and forms (difficult to read these longer sections with the tiny font size!)<br /><br />The amount and level of detail of the program notes is impressive - giving musical history, perspective and minor analysis for not only a given category of work (say, Mozart's 27 piano concertos) but also most or all of the individual works!  These essays are not unlike those found in a CD liner notes.  So, with this guide, you can look up the background and musical insights of Mozart's concerto #20 as well as see what recordings/astists are recommended for that one concerto. The only other guide that does this is Penguin Guide.  So, now can you appreciate why this book has such tiny print and weighs a ton?  But, as enormous as this guide is, don't expect EVERY composition to be listed.  For instance, under \\"Beethoven\\" there is ample discussion about the string quartets, there is little text or recordings for the ten violin sonatas and early string trios.<br /><br />Another valuable aspect for many will be the biographies of the great past and present PERFORMERS.  This volume contains fairly detailed highlights of each artist career (2-4 paragraphs) AND a listing of their finest recordings for performers like Argerich, Grumiaux, Perlman, Perahia, Rubinstein, Horowitz, Galloway, Holzinger, Bain and so on.  (But some of your personal favorites may not be there - like Rachel Podger and Pamela Frank for me).  However, I found the performer biographies a bit dry with not enough juicy details about their lives, styles and sometimes quirky sides to make it really compelling and interesting.  (tip: one of the best books for fascinating personal stories on the great pianists is David Dubal's book, \\"The Art of the Piano\\").<br /><br />Also, keep in mind that the AMG is NOT a CD/DVD guide as it only LISTS a few recommended recordings and does not compare/contrast/explain them (like Penguin, Third Ear, or Gramophone Guides).  But, then again the title says \\"Guide to Classical Music\\" and not \\"Guide to CD's DVD's\\" like the others.  So, its a different animal.  But, I thought the AMG's focused recommendations were up-to-date and reliable overall, giving a good range of historic, modern, and budget choices.  All-in-all, a valuable addition if you already have Penguin, Gramophone and Third Ear Guides to Classical Music.	2005-10-13

My family just came back from the Smokies a month ago and I happened to bring back this little book. One thing you should know about me is that I try to buy a couple of books on the region of the country that we are visiting. This was one of them. I am intrigued by the history of the places I visit. The Smokies is definitely one place that we are going back to.  <br /> <br />This is a fascinating look at life in the mountains. It is not your stereotypical book either ~~ these women are magnificent women and the author brings their stories to life just by describing their daily routines, their beliefs and how life in the mountains were lived. Their lives were not easy ~~ and nor were they idle. But they were not complainers ~~ and obviously it worked for them as they stayed in the mountains fourteen years or so after the Smokies became a national park.  <br /> <br />This book is packed with tidbits of history and some of their superstitions. It is full of information on how they survived off the land ~~ just like the Indians, they made use of just about everything they either grow or made. The author told of how they courted among themselves, how they entertained one another (with stories by the fireplace, dances and music and church-goings ~~ even chores were oftentimes excuses to get together and visit), and how they survived in the wilderness without doctors or hospitals nearby. <br /> <br />If you are looking for something that reminds you of your ancestors' lives, this is a great book to pick up! It is a slim volume but it is packed full of interesting tidbits. It gives you an idea of just how hard life can be in those days and sometimes, how much more richer it really was.  <br /> <br />10-12-05	2005-10-13

Pi's creativity and strong will keeps the reader entranced and often surprised.  Even in Part I, when the novel seems to be random tidbits about Pi's life, the little descriptions and short stories are creative and often humorous.  However, I had thought that this book would, as it said, make me \\"believe in God.\\"  Because I thought I was going to discover insight on God, I was disappointed.  The majority of the book does not focus on religion or God at all.  Even though Pi lives and that probably required God's help, a story like that should not be called one that makes you \\"believe in God.\\"  If you do not expect to gain truths about God and wish to fall into a captivating story of a young boys fantastic survival, Li of Pi can fulfill, but it can not fulfill its promise of making \\"you believe in God.\\"  I rated it a four because of this disappointment in its lack of fulfillment in its promise and for a lack of definite conclusion.  I did find the twist at the end with the other version of Pi's story to be fascinating.  I had accepted pretty much everything he had told us up until that point, and I thought it was great that Pi could have been making up/ imagining the animals and other things.  To me that seems to be a great coping mechanism for young Pi that helped him deal with the problems he faced.  I do however wish that the author would not have left the book hanging with the reader wondering whether or not Pi's story with the animals was the one that really happened or the one with the humans.  If the animal version was true, this would not necessarily make me \\"believe in God;\\" it would make me believe in the power of imagination.	2005-10-13

And in an online shop a customer can't simply flip through the volume to correct the first impression. That's why I'm writing this review: <br /> <br />In my opinion Harold Davis' book is not so much a field guide (in which I'd expect the usual tables, factors, formulae etc.) but rather a really comprehensive beginner's guide to digital photography. It answers all the questions a newbie could possibly have, and it does so in precise yet fun-to-read language.  <br /> <br />The best part about the guide is a practice chapter that covers quite a few topics of everyday photography and shows how to do these yourself - even with a point-and-shoot digicam. You learn what's important technically as well as aesthetically, read about the best timing and weather for a given theme... and when the photo is taken, there's a chapter on \\"digital darkroom\\" basics as well.  <br /> <br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who's new to (digital) photography. My rating's a 4* only because print detail quality could be a bit better.	2005-10-13

In the beginning it was a little confusing b/c the author introduced so many names of relatives without clearly defining who each was and their relation to Andrew. <br /> <br />The reason I gave it 3 stars is b/c the author has an undertone that he really doesn't like Carnegie b/c his father worked slave type of labor in Carnegie's steel mills. It's not enough to ruin the book - but he takes some personal jabs at Carnegie as a person based on the author's personal views and hangups.  The author doesn't seem to appreciate capitalism and holds that against Carnegie throughout the reading.  There is an undertone of the author's feelings throughout the book - and I am more interested in Carnegie than the author's feelings of capitalism / politics / carnegie etc.  <br /> <br />Good book - but I plan to read another biography or autobiography to confirm or challenge some of the author's portrayals of Carnegie himself.  But definitely a wealth of info to where you can learn ALOT about Andrew Carnegie and the activities / decisions that lead him on path to the Giant he became. <br /> <br />Jake  <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

This gentleman is the real deal. A true professional who has even written an authorized book on Kiss. Here is Ken's review as it appeared a few weeks back in Friday Morning Quarterback -- <br /> <br />\\"Through various lineup changes and musical trends, and over 75 million in sales, the mighty Van Halen remain one of America's most inventive, exciting and revered rock powerhouses. A new book, Van Halen 101, provides an all-encompassing look at Pasadena, California's hard rock champions. Written by Abel Sanchez, the book, featuring a foreword by Queen guitarist Brian May, offers everything you wanted to know about VH and much much more. Tallying over 400 pages, the book chronicles the group's heady early days playing backyard parties in Pasadena and their long stint headlining Gazzarri's on Hollywood's famed Sunset Strip to their sensational self-titled debut to the group's most recent 2004 tour. Archival interviews with the band, producers, engineers, road crew and industry insiders help shape their compelling story. <br /> <br />\\"Along with an extensive overview of the group's four-decade career, the book also includes a slew of noted six-string luminaries attesting to the groundbreaking guitar work of Edward Van Halen, among them, Joe Walsh, B.B. King, Robby Krieger, Dave Navarro, Ted Nugent, Steve Vai, Steve Howe, James Hetfield, Joe Satriani, the late \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell Abbott, Steve Cropper, Allan Holdsworth, Zakk Wylde, Steve Lukather, John McLaughlin and more. Making this book even more indispensable for Van Halen's legion of worldwide supporters is the inclusion of a comprehensive look behind the recording of each Van Halen album, an in-depth peek behind the VH sound with special emphasis on Eddie's revolutionary playing including a look at the creation of 'Eruption,' his jaw-dropping display of six-string virtuosity, his extraordinary tapping technique, and his arsenal of guitars and gear. All told, Van Halen 101 is a terrific encapsulation of Van Halen's storied musical career, their vast impact on the music scene and their unassailable legacy as purveryors of heavy metal genius.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Now that's a review. Along with this, Van Halen 101 even received the stamp of approval from Guitar World (the premier guitar magazine on the planet). Look no further than the back cover of the book and you will find a quote from an Editor of GW proclaiming, \\"I liked what I read a lot. This book is a labor of love and all true VH fans will love it.\\" <br /> <br />When a book receives the stamp of approval from authorities such as Ken Sharp and Guitar World Magazine, everyone can rest assured it kicks some serious arse.	2005-10-13

We see their day-to-day existence through Davy's point of view, a loose and rambling prose that relates every incident in the same casual style, whether it be negotiating the use of a coupon to buy deodorant in a grocery store or a paid sexual encounter turned unexpectedly violent. While Davy's matter-of-factness makes the book's more unsavory, possibly disturbing, aspects more palatable, it also purposely, and cleverly, masks any potential despair over his lot in life. To his credit, Williams doesn't try too hard to make the vernacular sound overly hip or colloquial; he strikes just the right tone so the reader can believe that these are the hurried, slightly scattered thoughts and voices of teenagers. In addition, the Pacific Northwest of the grunge-era nineties is nicely evoked as the kids flit between various locales and fuss over the more popular rock bands. <br /> <br />Although Davy and Nikki are the high school sweethearts who hitchhike from Eugene together at the start of the book, the true love story at the heart of the novel is between Davy and James, a sensitive young hustler they hook up with in a Portland park. Davy's special affection for James becomes apparent only very slowly, emerging in direct correlation with the escalation of danger and discomfort in their lives, of which James has a lower tolerance than the others. While most of the book's sex is quite clinical and impersonally portrayed, there is one scene between these two that is quite different. Davy and James are encouraged by their pimp, Branch, to spend their \\"vacation day\\" in a gay bath house and once there, they have an incredibly erotic, but surprisingly tender, sexual encounter that takes the concept of PDA to a whole new level. Very hot. <br /> <br />Rather than indulge in a lot of navel gazing or dwell onthe tragedy of his life, Davy merely focuses on getting through each day. Watching the mundane struggles of these kids, whether it be in securing a new squat, feeding themselves, earning money, shopping or negotiating free time, we come to recognize ourselves and our own very compromised, often unsatisfying, lives. Highly recommended. <br />	2005-10-13

Empiricism is seen in distinction from Rationalism, in that it doubts the viability of universal principles (rational or otherwise), and uses sense data as the basis of all knowledge - experience is the source of knowledge. Hume was a skeptic as well as empiricist, and had radical (for the time) atheist ideas that often got in the way of his professional advancement, but given his reliance on experience (and the kinds of experiences he had), his problem with much that was considered conventional was understandable.<br /><br />Hume's major work, 'A Treatise of Human Nature', was not well received intially - according to Hume, 'it fell dead-born from the press'. Hume reworked the first part of this work in a more popular way for this text, which has become a standard, and perhaps the best introduction to Empiricism.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the idea of empiricism is that experience teaches, and rules and understanding are derived from this. However, for Hume this wasn't sufficient. Just because billiard balls when striking always behave in a certain manner, or just because the sun always rose in the morning, there was no direct causal connection that could be automatically affirmed - we assume a necessary connection, but how can this be proved?<br /><br />Hume's ideas impact not only metaphysics, but also epistemology and psychology. Hume develops empiricism to a point that empiricism is practically unsupportable (and it is in this regard that Kant sees this text as a very important piece, and works toward his synthesis of Empiricism and Rationalism). For Hume, empirical thought requires skepticism, but leaves it unresolved as far as what one then needs to accept with regard to reason and understanding. According to scholar Eric Steinberg, 'A view that pervades nearly all of Hume's philosophical writings is that both ancient and modern philosophers have been guilty of optimistic and exaggerated claims for the power of human reason.'<br /><br />Some have seen Hume as presenting a fundamental mistrust of daily belief while recognising that we cannot escape from some sort of framework; others have seen Hume as working toward a more naturalist paradigm of human understanding. In fact, Hume is open to a number of different interpretations, and these different interpretations have been taken up by subsequent philosphers to develop areas of synthetic philosophical ideas, as well as further developments more directly out of Empiricism (such as Phenomenology).<br /><br />The text of Hume is in fact a rather short book, a mere 100 pages or so in many editions (it is about 120 in this edition). As a primer for understanding Hume, the British Empiricists (who include Hobbes, Locke, and Berkeley), as well as the major philosphical concerns of the eighteenth century, this is a great text with which to start.<br /><br />Editor Tom. L. Beauchamp has provided an extensive section of annotations (over half as long as the Hume's text itself), as well as generous section on variations and emendations.  There are several different indexes, a worthwhile glossary, a biographical section and good list of references.

I think that Angie Sage has a talent that is going to grow over her writing career. I mean, her plot is a little twisting and confusing, but the characters are funny, and the dialogue can connect well to each other. This book is a little dragging in the middle, but the ending is fantastic with the promise of a sequel attracting more readers. <br /> <br />This book starts with Silas Heap finding a baby girl with violet eyes in the snow. Little did he know that this girl was the princess, the next victim of the Assasins of the throne. Silas Heap's seventh son, Septimus Heap, disappears on the same night Silas finds the princess. <br /> <br />Named Jenna, the princess grows up with no knowledge of her royal past until she goes on the run from the Assasins. Read Magyk to find out what happens to Jenna. Angie Sage leads readers with the new \\"Harry Potter\\" talent with fun characters, magykal charms, potions, and spells. This book is full of humor and about finding your true self.  <br /> <br />I can't wait for the sequel to come out!! Read this book!!	2005-10-13

Although his writing is very simple and somewhat predictable, he tells a good story. For those who enjoy romances in foreign settings, touched with a bit of adventure, here's a book you can get into pretty quickly. It opens with a man and his daughter (unnamed characters) on a tour in the jungles of Peru to help out with the poor. During this trip, the man encounters Paul Cook, who then proceeds to tell his story. <br /> <br />Paul's story begins on Christmas Eve in the ER back in the United States. He's on duty that night and thinks he could have saved his two main patients, but unfortunately they do not make it. One is a young boy who had a tiny toy soldier lodged in his throat. The other is a middle-aged man who had a heart attack. Following the end of this scene, the story moves on to Christine, who has just been dumped by her fianc a week before their wedding. She is devastated and cannot understand why this is happening to her. All her life she has dreamed of her wedding day, and now it's not even going to happen. <br /> <br />Best friend Jessica tries to cheer Christine up by taking them both on a trip to Peru for a tour that will allow them to work with the poor, helping the villagers while also learning about the native jungles and what it is like to live there. Despite Christine's protests, they end up in Machu Picchu anyway. Christine is a city girl and is very high-maintenance. She does not do well at all during the initial part of their trip, complaining nonstop. But on her first day in the village, she bumps into a man, Paul Cook, not realizing that it's his orphanage they will be helping out during their stay in Peru. <br /> <br />While Evans's writing is rather simplistic in nature, the focus is the story and the characters he creates. He paints an exciting and exotic portrait of the jungles of Peru, and the reader will be able to imagine the life these people lead. PaulCook left the States to devote his time to these poverty-stricken children, and while he seems very content, it is Christine who awakens something in him. He's almost ready to ask her to commit to a relationship, despite the fact that he lives in poverty and has nothing to offer her except his love. <br /> <br />Christine starts off as a very high-maintenance prima donna who I didn't care for, but Peru changes her and helps her grow up. Working with the poor also helps her forget Martin, the fianc who abandoned her a week before their wedding. I found Jessica to be rather irritating as she seems to be the exact opposite of Christine. While Christine is rigid and follows the rules, Jessica is very free-spirited and blase about her relationships with men. The casual affair means nothing to her but fun and excitement. Christine needs something more than just fast sex and a roll in the hay. She is touched by Paul's devotion to the villagers, admires him, and finds him to be very attractive. While Christine and Paul get to know each other as friends, Jessica also meets a man who may change her life --- or maybe he will pass through her life before she meets yet another eligible bachelor. Her actions, however, endanger her life and the lives of others, as readers will find out. <br /> <br />THE SUNFLOWER is what I like to call a comfort read, a simply written love story that is clean and almost old-fashioned in its contents. This is the story of two people who meet by chance and whose lives are changed forever because of it. Recommended. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Marie Hashima Lofton (Ratmammy@lofton.org) <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

She winds a fast-paced story through several subplots just to make sure she has captured everyone's attention.  I'm sure those not encapsulated don't have a pulse because she's incredible.  She writes a tale that keeps you turning pages as fast as you can until the very end only to catch your breath and realize you immediately want another of her books to read.<br /><br />Harlow Grail is the young teenage daughter of an actress and wealthy plastic surgeon.  Her life is privileged and she lacks for nothing.  That comfortable life changes to horror when she's kidnapped.  Timmy, the son of the Grail housekeeper, is with her and also becomes a victim since he can identify the captors.  When Kurt, the kidnapper, discovers that the Grails have contacted the police against his warnings, he suffocates Timmy and cuts off Harlow's pinkie.  She miraculously escapes when she realizes he will soon kill her too.  Her missing pinkie is a constant reminder throughout her life of this ordeal and the loss of her friend.<br /><br />Twenty-three years later, Harlow Grail has changed her name to Anna North.  She lives a new life in which no one knows her past.  New Orleans is the home for this renowned mystery writer and she likes the secluded life she leads.  All is well until Anna's mother tells the press that Harlow is alive and well in New Orleans with a new identity.  People start putting two and two together and the trail leads to Anna.<br /><br />Soon after, murders begin to occur.  When one victim has her pinkie sliced off, Anna begins to think Kurt has found her and is coming to kill her.  Quentin Malone, homicide detective and hunk, is assigned to the case and meets Anna.  Romantic sparks soon fly and the reader is tossed from a romance theme to a psychological thriller and back again.  Malone and his partner must try to protect Anna and the best way to do so is find the killer before he finds her, if he is Kurt.<br /><br />Spindler excels at either her research of New Orleans or she has visited/lived there.  Her vivid descriptions of various places make the reader want to visit.  Even the description of the foods can make your mouth water!  I'm not sure if it's research or she shares some of her favorite places with us in this book.<br /><br />Another thing that makes Spindler outstanding is her fast paced storyline.  She develops characters to which the reader can relate.  And each of these characters is likeable - I found myself drawn to Anna.  I found myself wanting to shake her mother for slipping and telling the world where her daughter is living and all but giving them her new identity.

It started perfectly, and kept getting better and better until I thought I was going to jump out of my skin if I read another word. I was wrong about that. My skin is still intact, but not by much. <br /> <br />FEVER is written by Sean Rowe, who has quite a background. He's been hit by a train and lived to tell about it; he's won awards for journalistic achievement; and, most pertinent for our purposes here today, he includes working as a copy reader for Adam & Eve --- a mail order company dealing in, uh, adult recreational products --- on his job resume. Although his debut novel doesn't have any photos or drawings going for it, Rowe nonetheless demonstrates that he is a craftsman of the highest order. <br /> <br />The story begins with what is probably the most ingenious frameups I've encountered in quite a while. It is Matt \\"Loose Cannon\\" Shannon who is on the receiving end of it; what hurts is that his stepbrother, Jack Fontana, sets up the whole thing. Fontana is freshly out of prison on an early release and has the ultimate rip-off planned --- the theft of a fortune in drug money that is secretly being transported in a cruise ship named the Norwegian Empress. <br /> <br />The problem --- one of many in this thrill-a-page novel --- is that Shannon, a retired FBI agent, is the security chief for the world's largest cruise line, whose holdings include the Empress. The frame ensures Cannon's reluctant cooperation. Fontana recruits a mixed bag of talent to pull off the heist, some of whom are tied to Shannon's past in ways he is totally unaware. The operation fluctuates wildly between success and failure from moment to moment, with Shannon having to wing it more often than not simply to stay alive and free at any given time. <br /> <br />And stealing the money is only half the battle. Shannon and Fontana first have to retrieve it and then hang on to it, all the while avoiding the law and lawless. Rowe isnothing less than marvelous here. Just when you think things aren't going to get any worse, they do. And when you think they can't possibly get better, they...well, you'll have to read the book to find out. <br /> <br />FEVER just might be one of the best thriller reads of the year, a year that has been full of great ones already. It's difficult to put down, and impossible to forget. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub <br />	2005-10-13

Having read all 6 books in the series I can say that J.K. Rowling is nowhere near the quality writer that J.R.R. Tolkein and C.S. Lewis were. Second, I would never recommend these books to young readers because of the violence that gets increasingly worse in each succeeding book.  The books  characters, i.e. witches, wizzards, etc. use \\"good\\" magic and \\"bad\\" magic. There is no such thing as \\"good\\" magic. These books stir up an unhealthy interest in the occult and the blackness that accompanies it. Harry Potter and his friends also take great delight in the misfortunes of others and many times contrive to cause these misfortunes to occur to those they dislike.  I would not recommend it for children.  The books are mildly interesting, causing the reader to want to know what happens next, but the story drags on in many places which tends to cause boredom with the story.	2005-10-13

It is also the novel where Brady first meets the character he becomes rather obsessed with throughout other novels Linda Manning.  Unlike most classic Brady novels of yesteryear this novel is not set in cold war Eastern Europe so you do not even have to imagine that the cold war has not ended or imagine and substitute a more modern foe of the West for the setting.  Away With Murder has Brady taking up what he is told will be a simple assignment of delivering a first edition algebra textbook from London to Amsterdam.  All seems to be going smoothly until he finds two men in his hotel room who want him to take a drive with them and won't take no for an answer.<br /><br />Previously I would have said Blind Date was my favourite Brady adventure but Away with Murder would have to at least tie if not beat it.  Pattinson writes in an old man style where his characters use words that show Pattinson is obviously from a previous generation and not quite down with the lingo of today but this style does add something unique and enjoyable to his novels.  High quality Pattinson novels worth your time and money are The Silent Voyage, Skeleton Island, The Time of Your Life, Blind Date, The Murmansk Assignment, Obituary for Howard Grey, Crane, The Animal Gang, Spoilers, The Golden Reef and Life Preserver.	2005-10-13

This is the one book that brought together everything that I had previously read in other books on Buddhism and meditation. With so many approaches to meditation, it's a relief to find an experienced practitioner who eloquently maps out the elements of Buddhist meditation in relationship to the balanced development of both wisdom and compassion. In particular, I found it very helpful the way the author divides the practice of 'samatha' or tranquility meditation and 'vipassana' techniques or insight meditation. The explanation of the Four Immeasurables (kindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity) and how they balance our practice that's useful to others as well as ourselves was also invaluable. The writing is condensed and to the point with many jewels of wisdom. I found myself underlining almost every other sentence. If you're looking for a clear outline for meditation practice and how to apply it to your daily practice on an off the meditation cushion, this is a great book to read, study, and put into practice.	2005-10-13

A great performance can make a poor story interesting, and make a great story shine. <br /> <br />In every respect that I can think of, Lenny Henry's reading of Neil Gaiman's \\"Anansi Boys\\" is the standard which every audiobook should reach for. <br /> <br />THE STORY <br />is excellent.  Neil has given us something of a comedy of manners, a family story that is very much a comedy in the P.G. Woodehouse mode (except with supernatural beings, their progency, those who love them, and their blogging roommates). Its one of those tight stories that take the time to show you what's going on and still astonishes.  I'm not going to take up too much more time gushing on this front.  Let's end this section with the fact that I had more fun reading this book than anything else I've read in a couple of years. <br /> <br />THE PERFORMANCE <br />is what I really wanted to mention.  Lenny Henry SHINES!  His pace is easy and not too rushed.  His accents (Carribean, American, English; and regional/cultural subsets of each) are good without being camp.  And most importantly, he offers a dozen or so exact, distinctive, age appropriate and recognizable voices for each character. <br /> <br />I cannot stress that last one enough.  One must sympathize with the difficult task of one voice coming up with all these voices.  Some audiobooks solve the problems by having more than one reader or just having the reader read in their own voice and use cues in the text (\\"...said Virginia hotly\\") to fill in the blanks. Other books too are first person narratives that lend themselves better to audiobooks. <br /> <br />Far too often, though, an actor will exaggerate something tocreate a distinctive voice for a character (ESPECIALLY a male reader reading a woman's part).  It is painful to hear someone adding an inappropriate speech impedement or something like a southern drawl just so that the listener can tell characters apart.   <br /> <br />Lenny avoids all of these pitfalls without the need of crutches.  In a third-person situation telling a sprawling (if short) tale in three different countries, his performance is masterful.  10 hours never flew by so fast. <br /> <br />I'm now going to purchase other audiobooks he's read just so I can hear him!	2005-10-13

Lots of good information, and it was written in part by someone who has really 'been there', so the advice comes off as realistic, not clinical and removed. I also like that this book addresses a wide variety of issues, for example, how to coordinate ABA and speech therapy programs, and how to work on things that aren't strictly 'traditional' ABA, like joint attention skills. A lot of books on autism give you so much background and theory but little in the way of actual, here-and-now, take-action advice, and this book does that. <br /> <br />I will say that I agree with those who dislike the book's dismissal of most all other, non-ABA therapies. Yes, the author does provide some research to back this up, but to say that this research is incomplete would be a gigantic understatement at best. A few studies are cited saying that this supplement or that 'alternative therapy' were unsuccessful, yes. The problem with this is that it ignores the fact that, for the most part, NO comparative research has been done on other treatments. It's not that the research exists and proves that ABA is most effective. It's simply that most other therapies (RDI, Floortime, DIR, natural language paradigm, etc., almost all of the nutritional programs,) have never been studied, and have certainly never been studied at the 40-hour a week levels that ABA uses. It's like going to a doctor and hearing \\"Well, we know that this drug works for about 50% of people. And these other drugs may or may not work, but we've never done any studies to find out.\\" A very frustrating situation, and hopefully one that will change in the future.	2005-10-13

It is odd, at first this book talks about how important relationships are, and bonding with your child - and then it goes and tells you that if you do not WHIP your baby, you are a bad parent.  The author believes that babies and children should be whipped, starting the first day they do something the parent doesn't like - such as crying or fighting a diaper change.  His view of children is that they are all little brats out to manipulate you as much as possible.  The author even advises the reader to whip a 7 month old, trip your child intentionally, pull your child's hair, ignore your child if he is injured.

To be frank, the minute I heard the premise of this book I knew that I would love it.  Author Frank Cottrell Boyce could have filled the pages of \\"Millions\\" with an unbroken stream of consciousness (appropriate for young readers, of course) and I STILL would have thought this book bloody marvelous.  As it happens, \\"Millions\\" is well-written in spite of my unrepentant love.  Sure it has its ups and downs and there is one plot element that doesn't make a lick of sense, but on the whole Boyce has come up with something truly smart and funny here.  As its hero Damian would say, \\"Quality\\".<br /><br />What would you do if you found 229,370 in cash?  If it just came falling out of the sky and into your lap, what would you do?  If you're like Damian, you've a moral dilemma on your hands.  Do you give the money to the poor or do you dig wells in Africa?  If you're Damian's older brother Anthony then you're trying to decide whether or invest in real estate or just buy a house upfront.  This may all sound like idle speculation, but for Damian and Anthony it's a problem they have to face right now!  You see, our story takes place mere days before England is just about to make the change from a pound based system to that of the new Euro.  That means that the money that came flying at Damian in a duffle bag thrown from a train has to be spent as quickly as possible before it becomes worthless.  Damian's goals tend to be goodhearted, partly because he's obsessed with saints and sainthood.  Anthony, however, is more inclined to want to spend the pounds on making more dough.  He's a businessman at heart.  Whatever their intentions, though, it soon becomes clear that having a lot of money is more difficult that either of them could have anticipated.  Especially when the people who threw it from the train in the first place want it back....<br /><br />Boyce's book is one of the rare children's novels that never hit it big in America but that still got made into a movie.  The book has a particularly contemporary feel to it.  The gadgets and games mentioned in it (such as plasma televisions) on first glance may date the novel in several years' time.  However, when you consider that this is basically a period piece anyway (it takes place at a very particular moment in history) then such excesses are more than justified.  Also, Damian constantly mentions a website that you should check out if you get a chance.  I wasn't personally able to figure out the games on that site, but it's still worth a chuckle.  Where else could you send a friend a saint's ear?<br /><br />The magical realism in \\"Millions\\" (Damian is visited frequently by saints of all types) works well within the story.  It rarely jars or falls flat.  The sole exception to this, to my mind, was the last visitation Damian receives.  I don't want to give anything away, but the moment is unnecessary and reminded me a bit more of that awful movie \\"Casper\\" than I would have liked.  Another problem with the book comes in the form of the character of Dorothy.  A potential girlfriend to the boys' father, she switches back and forth between good and bad without any logic.  One moment Damian's having visions of her on a train and the next she's waltzing into the house, clearly not on a train.  It's not only confusing, but downright weird and done without much in the way of explanation.<br /><br />Still, the book's a gem.  It's hard to create a likable character like Damian who is so very very good without turning him into an annoying freak of some kind.  It is exceedingly easy to write a mean or nasty character.  To write a good one can be an excessive challenge.  Damian, however, is perfect the way he is.  You never resent him and you're always on his side.  \\"Millions\\" also shows the evils of money as clearly as possible.  Consider pairing this with \\"The Toothpaste Millionaire\\" by Jean Merrill for some alternating views of children and excessive wealth.  Just make sure you read this book first.  Though I was pretty certain that I'd love it right from the start, it's probably got more fans out there than anyone could suspect.  Incredibly fun.\\" by Jean Merrill for some alternating views of children and excessive wealth.  Just make sure you read this book first.

Rob Bell's first book, Velvet Elvis: Repainting the Christian Faith, is as enticing and challenging as his teachings from his pulpit. Bell, the pastor of Mars Hill Church in Grand Rapids, MI, has quickly climbed to the top of the charts among young, emerging church leaders. His curiosity, insight, and honesty makes for a somewhat \\"outside the box\\" type of read. <br /> <br />What if the Velvet Elvis painting he owns was the definitive painting of Elvis? What if no other paintings of Elvis were necessary? What if that one painting of the King defined everything about him? It's crazy to think that there is only one accurate portrayal of Elvis. <br /> <br />What would the church be like if someone decided that there is only one way to do church? What if we did not allow church leaders and next generation Christians to paint the church in a fresh way? What if we said that the church has already been accurately portrayed and there is no reason to mess with it? It would be sad. <br /> <br />Rob Bell challenges us to think new thoughts about Jesus and how we \\"paint\\" his church.

Since the root of all conflict is seeing differences between yourself and another, love truly seems to be the key to eliminating conflict.\\" - Doreen Virtue<br /><br />Collectively, our bodies are groaning under the weight of environmental pollution, sulfites, conflict, psychic debris, and ego-induced fears and stressors. On a larger scale, this strain is taking a toll on Mother Earth and precious natural resources.<br /><br />In her book Goddesses & Angels - Awakening Your Inner High-Priestess and \\"Source-eress\\", angel therapist and clairvoyant channel Doreen Virtue sounds a clarion call for reclaiming the Divine feminine that has largely been banished from modern culture. Stressing the importance of balance between feminine and masculine energies (rather than demonizing the latter), Doreen relates raw personal anecdotes and spiritual lessons for welcoming and integrating the Goddess.<br /><br />As she did in previous books like Angel Medicine, Doreen shares mystical, alchemical, and esoteric teachings culled from various shamans, healers, historians, scientists, and \\"new\\" kids that she encounters in her world travels. For example, Doreen and her husband (author/shaman Steven Farmer) meet with a Mayan astrologer in Cancun. The astrologer relates how the 13 houses of the Mayan system connect to the 13 annual cycles of the moon and feminine energy. As depicted on the Mexican flag, the matriarchal Mayan tradition believed in the balance of the serpent and the eagle-the feminine and masculine-for inner and outer harmony. In fact, the pyramid of Chichen Itza-based on the two Mayan calendars-reflects the fusing of these energies with the interior steps adding up to 260 (the number of days in the feminine Tzolkin calendar) and the outer steps adding up to 365 (the number of days in the masculine Haab calendar.)<br /><br />Woven throughout the fascinating conversations and synchronicities Doreen shares in Goddesses & Angels are intriguing metaphysical teachings based upon the Guidance and channelings of both Angels and Goddesses.  Archangel Michael tells Doreen, quite bluntly, that sulfur-containing chemicals known as sulfites were causing her body to bloat and her skin to itch. As soon as she eliminated sulfites from her diet, the symptoms disappeared and 45 pounds melted right off her.<br /><br />Other fascinating information found in Goddesses and Angels include:<br /><br />* Healing ceremonies experienced in a sweat lodge, upon crystal beds, atop the rocks of Arizona, on the shores of sandy beaches, at the Lourdes grotto, within a Goddess Temple, at Brigit's Well, in Bernadette's Cahot and other sacred sites<br /><br />* The return of mer-people to the Earth and the possible aquatic origins of mankind-as well as the connection to dolphins<br /><br />* The unedited Course in Miracles, known as the Urtext, and how this document differs from the popular edited Course<br /><br />* Attributes, gifts, and personality traits of the four elements-Fire, Water, Air, and Earth-and how these correlate to hair and eye color<br /><br />* Messages from the Dalai Lama, Amma (the hugging saint), and Masaru Emoto as they relate to consciousness, peace, and compassion<br /><br />* Remembering Atlantean and Lemurian culture and spiritual teachings-including how the cravings for chocolate are the cravings for Atlantis<br /><br />* Further observations about the Indigo, Crystal, and Rainbow children<br /><br />* Manifestation and abundance<br /><br />* Biological functions such as the synchronization of mirror neurons and how they connect to increased consciousness<br /><br />* The power of water and fire energy and how they connect to invoking and manifesting Goddess energy<br /><br />* Energy drainage and its connection to etheric cords, excessive giving without regards to self-nurturing, and negative people and attitudes<br /><br />* Interactions with-and messages from-Goddesses such as Artemis, Xochiquetzal, Brigit, Kali, and Mother Mary as well as archangels Michael, Metatron, Raziel, and others<br /><br />* The power-and purpose-of prayer<br /><br />Other interesting tidbits and wise counsel are packed into Goddesses & Angels-Awakening Your Inner High-Priestess and \\"Source-eress\\". Part II of the book-spanning only 14 pages-lists various Goddesses and Angels, but the information is very basic. If you want a more thorough treatment of Goddesses and Angels-without the travelogue-Archangels and Ascended Masters is a better choice.<br /><br />I had resistance to some of the theories raised in the book, but I tried to keep an open mind. For example, Doreen believes in Walk-Ins, which are supposedly souls that \\"stepped into\\" the body of another when an individual is suicidal or traumatized. In his book Journey of Souls, hypnotherapist Dr. Michael Newton emphatically denies the existence of Walk-Ins because the transference would supplant and individual's personally chosen path. After regressing hundreds of people over the years, it was obvious that Walk-Ins did not exist.<br /><br />In addition, Doreen elevates dolphins to a spiritually ascended state, as do many New Agers. Yet, neither she nor dolphin devotees acknowledge the complex social structure of dolphins and how orchestrated gang rape, bullying, the harassment and forced isolation of females, and the killing of dolphin babies so they can \\"get it on\\" with the  mother-occur quite frequently. (If this bursts your metaphysical bubble, you're not alone. My husband and I were disappointed to discover this, as well.) These behaviors are extra chilling in light of Doreen's belief that dolphins, once \\"one with the humans\\", shape-shifted and went to the sea until humanity became more \\"peaceful and environmentally conscious\\"-and that dolphin channelings assert that \\"Now is the time...we're coming back to take over the world.\\"<br /><br />Fans of Doreen Virtue and books like The Lightworker's Way and Angel Medicine will be thrilled with Goddesses & Angels. If you're new to Doreen's work, it's not necessary to have read any of her other books to get something out of this one. However, if you're not used to New Age ideas, you may find this book a bit \\"out there\\".

All in all, this book is worth the effort.<br /><br />Terry Tucker, Prof Military Studies/History<br /><br />Senior Doctrine Developer, SANGMP	2005-10-13

Sandy Herrault's new 'Smart Violin Method' is a great resource for beginner fiddling. I use the 'Smart Method' with almost all of my 30 violin students; the pieces follow an easy progression and are refreshing for both teachers and students. They are also great for helping students learn to read music.  I use Sandy's books to complement Suzuki books, and the kids love the pieces. I highly recommend these books.	2005-10-13

Very few. So when I saw the Times review a while back, along with a recommendation from my closest friend, I had a mixture of trepidation and curiosity.  The one exception to this \\"run screaming in the other direction\\" reaction has been this highly imaginative and riveting work by Jackson McCrae.  It's hard to go into things here as far as plot, characters, tie-ins, etc. as so many others have done that and you can see for yourself that many people love this work.   <br /> <br />One of the themes of this book is that of redemption through forgiveness. But the path is not easy and McCrae does make us work through the process, just as he had to.  Short story chapters of his life alternate with present day New York job stress and remembrances.  These two \\"styles\\" and chapter-types play off one another until they build to an incredibly emotional and devestating climax.  When you do get to the climax of the novel, be prepared. You will need to stop, put the book down, and pick your jaw up off the floor.  I guarantee you that you've never read anything as shocking as this one chapter. Someone once said that there is nothing new under the sun. I've alway believed that---until I read this book.  The horrific incident that fuels the writer's quest to find out what happened to him as a child is so totally devestating that you'll be in shock for weeks.  Graphic? Oh, yes. Not for the squeamish either.  But it works perfectly and after that, all the stories that came before it make perfect sense.  It's as if this novel is one big puzzle and McCrae is putting it together for you, one piece at a time.  When he does finally give you the last piece, you fall back, amazed that you didn't see it coming.    <br /> <br />Built from the ground up, this literary masterpiece is far beyond anything out on the book market today.  If you read the many reviews you'll seethat there are references upon references to Capote.  While this is indeed correct, it's only a \\"jumping off\\" point and not meant to be an exact replica of that author's style or thought process.  It's as if the writer \\"in the book\\" is enamored with Mr. C and can't help himself. But this is really only a small portion of this great and well-built novel. Forget all this---the metaphors, the layers, the tie-ins to Keller, Capote, and any and every other literary tricks the author is capable of----and his technique is admirable, even genius.  But this is, above all, a story from the heart.  It's about people connecting.  It's about finding out who you are.  It's about life's experiences, good and bad.  It's about the horrible things people do to each other.  And it's about the goodness in people.  This novel is life itself.   <br /> <br />It's been said that everyone has a story to tell.  Trust me-no one has one quite like this.  There's something about the settings, the timing, the brave human acts of kindness, that could not be replicated anywhere, anytime, at any other place in the world.  McCrae has taken the very center of the Civil Rights movement and used it as a character itself.  Couple this with the heroics of the African-American housekeeper and you've got a formula for success.  Which is exactly what this book is----success. For those who get what the author is trying to do, please pass this along to a friend.  This book is based on a true story, and only a small portion of names and places have been changed. That the author was able to bare his soul and laugh at certain incidents only reinforces the idea of survival.  And what a survivor he must be----he lived to write this no-holds-barred experience of his life---obviously in the hope that it would be an inspiration to others.  I know, for it inspired me.  Something this great, this perfect, and this human only comes along once in a lifetime.  Grab it while you can. You're in the presence of genius---pure, simple . . . genius. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

Then follow the original shooting scripts for the first 8 episodes of the series. <br /> <br />Each is reproduced in full, along with cast lists, transmission dates, writers details, original TV Times \\"trailers\\", and music cues. The highlight of the reproductions, other than being able to witness the superb scriptwriting, are the endless footnotes supplied by the author. Every single subtle change from the original script to the finished programme are highlighted in these extensive notes, as are interesting snippets of information concerning the filming locations, shooting schedule, performers, crew, and much more. The amount of information Rob has managed to include is not far from astounding, and the mind boggles as to how many times he must have watched the episodes to include every otherwise unnoticeable word change. The above-mentioned footnotes are fascinating, and make this book the ultimate tome of \\"Prisoner\\" information. <br /> <br />Also included is \\"The Outsider\\", an unused script written by Morris Farhi (rejected by McGoohan), and two storyline ideas submitted by series Music Editor Eric Mival, as well as a biography of George Markstein. It could be argued that the scripts and footnotes would be enough to justify a positive review, but these rare \\"bonus items\\" are the icing on the cake and also make for fascinating reading. <br /> <br />Those familiar with the scenes of \\"The Prisoner\\" could be forgiven for thinking that reading such a book might be a dull experience, as they already have the episodes on DVD, but they couldn't be more wrong. Whilst much of the scripts remained unaltered for the finished product, there is much that isdifferent. Small/subtle changes in some cases, large changes in others, each and every one is included. Two such interesting things include the inclusion of the \\"original\\" Rover device, complete with flashing blue light, and mentions of Number Two's residence as the \\"Georgian Cottage\\", rather than the more familiar \\"Green Dome\\".  <br /> <br />To list all the interesting script changes here would be an impossible task, so I will close by advising that you go out and buy this book and see them all for yourself. At 19.99 (hardback) it is by no means cheap, but is well worth the price for the scripts alone, let alone all the \\"bonus items\\" and countless footnotes. <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

Pierce forcefully explores the shortcomings of conventional treatments without being an annoying crusader.  Hope is priceless when dealing with cancer.  Pierce states, \\"Effective alternative, non-toxic approaches to cancer are obtainable today.\\"  She does the reader a good turn by sorting out credible approaches to cancer treatment that are  \\"not prescribed by mainstream medicine.\\"  If you have just been diagnosed, you don't have months to research to find something that will work.  Tanya Pierce has done just that for you by writing this powerful book.    Pierce presents the twelve most effective approaches to cancer treatment available today.  She explains the science behind each alternative method in a way that is easy for non-medical professionals to understand.  Pierce walks the reader through the twelve approaches in a way that you know why you would choose a particular treatment plan.    Outsmart Your Cancer is tightly written.  Tanya Pierce stays on point and does not stray.  She has made a complicated and emotional subject digestible.  Pierce makes a more than compelling argument for abandoning toxic methods and choosing alternatives \\"that allow for continuous use,\\" rather than approaches that give very short term \\"gains\\" and exhaust the body.    Reading Outsmart Your Cancer is like attending the finest university and you cannot wait for class to begin.  I was annoyed when my reading was interrupted; and, elated when it resumed.  Unlike some miracle cure authors, Tanya Pierce delivers.  In the Dealing With Fear and the Mind/Body Connection chapter, Pierce stays on point and gives you an important bottom line:  \\"...you may want to ask yourself the hard question of whether you really want to live for yourself.\\"     If you want to live for yourself you have to read Outsmart Your Cancer.

This one is, I hate to say it, worse, but for diffrent reasons. <br /> <br />A 55 year old woman is raped and then rescued by her husband. His first thought is to have sex with her in case she's fallen pregnant by her attackers. She seems to think this is a good idea. How offensive is this? Let me count the ways. <br /> <br />Rape isn't about sex, first of all. It's about violence. Jamie doesn't understand that, which might be expected given his time and place, but you'd think Claire would set him straight. You'd also think that her general health and state of mind would be more important to him than any worries about pregnancy. In a purely biological sense, I assume Claire is not exempt from menopause just because she time travels.  Most of all I just can't accept the idea of her being raped, and then being interested in sex with a husband who is so callous and self centered. If that is true to Jamie's character, I don't like what he's become. <br /> <br />Also, I can't believe I'm the only person disturbed by the general homophobia.   Claire suggests that John Gray is interested in Jamie's son because of the resemblance. This is a stereotype more destructive than most, that gay men are all interested in young boys. I had to read the passage a couple times before I could believe what I was reading. If that is true to Clair's character, I don't like what she's become. <br /> <br />In short, I don't like what has become of any of the characters or the series as a whole, and I'm saddened by the decline of the story.	2005-10-13

Almost every culture, from ancient times to the present, has been infected with this philosophy. His book covers its history from Biblical times to the late 20th Century.  The first two thirds look at Europan and western attitudes, and how they contributed to the holocaust and have changed since World War II.  The final third examines the Islamic world and the present conflict over Israel.  This last section is in many ways the most interesting, as it covers material many in the West may be less familiar with.<br /><br />  The greatest weakness here is that while the author gives us many facts, he offers very little in the way of explanation.  We learn almost nothing about why antisemitism has been so prevelant or so intense, or why, like a natural disaster, it flares up in cycles every so often.  No one expects Wistrich to have the final answer here, but he should have made at least some attempt to discover the reasons for the 'longest hatred'.	2005-10-13

It is a fiction book about a girl and her adventures in a new world. Some of the places she visits are so amazing, diverse, and insane. The world of the Abrarat is just an ocean and 25 islands, nothing more. Each of the 24 hours of the day represents the 24 islands. So on each of the islands it is an hour of the day, so on the first island it is one o'clock all the time. People on the island mostly just sleep whenever they need it because day and night do not come on the Abarat. The ocean that separates all the islands is called Isabella. The way that the Abarat is connected to the human world is the Isabella has to roll into a port in the middle of a town called chicken town, which is surrounded by land on all sides. The way that the Isabella has to be summoned is by a magical ball and cup game inside of a old rotting away lighthouse. <br />The Abarat is full of mystic wonders and horrible scary creatures. The antagonist of the story is a man named Christopher carrion. He lives on the island of midnight and is the ruler of all evil. The antagonist of the story is a girl who lives in chicken town named candy. She is whisked away into the Abarat and away on an exciting adventure that plans to span three books! I recommend this book to any age level as the concepts are not to complex and yet they still entertain a collage reader. This is one of the best books I have ever read! <br />	2005-10-13

Gabriel Garcia Marquez weaves a beautiful tale of mystery and wonder. The story center around the Buendias living in a fictional Central/South American town. We're lead through the lives of each person generation after generation, each person has different story and you would think that this would get redundant but with each new birth I am anxious, awaiting the next tale. There is a legacy that continues through each and everyone.  <br /> <br />It's uncoventional perhaps, there's no true \\"hero\\" or a central story line. But Marquez somehow effortlessly flows from one generation to the other without an annoying break in the story. He just simply begins one story and ends another simultaneously without leaving any questions or doubts. And you would also think that all of the similar names that jump around would get confusing but they surprisingly don't, that somehow is not a problem. <br /> <br />I don't know how he does it but Marquez tells a simple tale with poetic grace and ease, never boring the reader and never losing ground or stalling. That is a true feat in itself. He blends without announcing it the fantasy world with reality, engaging the imagination and keeping you turning the pages. The anti-climax was breathtaking and the simple ending should have been boring, but it wasn't. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this read, it's a tale for the ages.	2005-10-13

Based on that alone I rated it a 2. The concept of identical twins and identity switching combined with insanity and crimes, was a good one. But, it did not turn out to be interesting and it was so poorly executed. First of, the novel was allot longer than the actual story - about 300 pages too long. This wall all filled with fluff, repetitions and inane language. I was especially annoyed by the language. I believe it was an attempt to write as people speak, but it came off forced and cutesy. For example, here are many over used terms in this book; normies, bugsies, Docypoo; babe; etc. Also, the introduction of a group supporting friends was introduced that resembled and unbelievable sort of Mod Squad. They wielded skills and super human influence, but were actually mild-mannered college students by day.

I DO think the sisters seemed very selfish leaving poor Anita to struggle with the worst possible relation!   <br /> <br />Before Anita goes on her journey to the great-aunt, she meets Kerne, the Duke of Ollerton, at a gate while he is out riding.  It is a momentous meeting as Anita in her fanciful way thinks he looks like the fallen angel Lucifer (and tells the Duke this) and Kerne remarks on some obscure poem that Anita actually knows.  He thinks she looks like a tiny angel.  They are to meet again and sooner than he thought. <br /> <br />Kerne has asked his mother to set up a house party so he may select a wife.  His career requires it!  His future duchess must be tall, statuesque, blonde - and on and on.... and his mother invites three eligible women to his home.  Both the Duke and Duchess (his mother) meet Anita at the pumps in Harrowgate and later, Kerne thinks of a way to save her from an unsavory marriage to an old man (her great-aunt's \\"pet\\" parson as they referred to him.). <br /> <br />Anita ends up at the Ollerton estate with the Duchess.  Her charming manner soon makes her popular to the household.  She is so open and fresh.  Later when joined by Kerne and his guests, even they find her delightful.  One guest, Lord Greshem finds her a little too delightful!  The events at the house party, from balls to early morning rides to a misunderstanding between Kerne and Anita is wonderfully portrayed.  You really are not sure how it will all work out.  And does it?  Can Anita really say no when the Duke asks her to marry him?  And why would she - read this lovely book and you will find out the answer.  <br /> <br />Why a five for this book?  I judged it against others like it.  It does not have an extended storyline or detailed character development of longer Regency novels, but there is something in this one that touches my heart.  I think if you are looking for a quick read with mild villainy, you will enjoy this!   <br />	2005-10-13

Books	5	3	4	N	N	reliable for orthodox and Orthodox Christians	I groaned when a fellow Eastern Orthodox Christian, a former Protestant, lent me this book.  Reading it, however, I became hooked; I was more than pleasantly surprised.  NT Wright's \\"daring\\" view of St. Paul is old hat, or should be, to Orthodox Christians, but it's still refreshing and illuminating to read what he has to say, even if the Church (the Orthodox Church) would find nothing very new in it.  The only question that remains is--why shouldn't Wright, now an Anglican bishop, make the jump to Orthodoxy?  His ecclesiastical messmates, as it were, are not even sure of Christ's divinity, so one wonders when Bishop Wright will make himself honest, or at least put himself in like-minded company.  In any case, this work is highly recommended.	2005-10-13

Her down-to-earth attitude and very sincere, nonjudgmental, and open-minded approach to writing, sex, and a potentially touchy subject is very impressive.<br /><br />She's covered nearly every aspect of shyness pertaining to self-image, sexual exploration, and body image; this book isn't just about dressing up and showing cleavage.  And let's clarify that it's not just geared toward a female audience either.  Queen talks directly, soothingly, to all those wishing to expand their sexual and self-confidence horizons.<br /><br />I was only amazed to find how far along the spectrum I am myself coming from such shy and conservative beginnings.  I was expecting practical steps and creative ideas for \\"coming out\\" on my own only to realize just how much of an exhibitionist I already am.  And that also credits how Queen begins with exibitionism in private and for oneself, establishing a comfort zone for the individual where it should be begun.<br /><br />I wish the book included more advanced exhibitionism techniques, or maybe more modern ones.  Queen could've ventured into the realm of exhibitionism acted out online in all the various forms, how to begin, safe places for exercising your turn-ons, etc.  Still, Queen covers the full spectrum of self-growth and comfort with exhibitionism so comprehensively that there are definitely creative ideas and issues addressed even for the more advanced.

That just doesn't hold water with me.  The books aren't advertised as requiring 1 year hands on experience in order to make sense of the material.

I'm generally not into books like this, but I've read this one 3 times, and it still never gets old. It's a book you read purely for entertainment, and it's got a captivating story.<br /><br />The characters are incredibly well developed throughout the book, as it traces an entire generation, and manages to carry the humanity of the characters through the epic reach of the story.<br /><br />Since so many others have already delineated the story, I guess I'll just give it my stamp of approval. It's one of the few books I have really had a hard time putting down, as (appropriately) simple as its narrative is. There's convincing emotion, and complex human interractions. The narrator Taita is an unexpectedly charismatic lead; a narscisistic but brilliant eunuch defined by his dedication and compassion. His characters are at times architypal, but Smith is a true master at manipulating your emotions. His villains are completely (if not transparently) depraved, and his heroes pure and chivalrous. The clash between them is pure hollywood style extravaganza, and it's entertaining as all hell.<br /><br />The book might be too much for people offended by gratuitous violence or graphic sex, because the book is loaded with both. It's actually somewhat indulgent in those respects, but what good adventure fiction isn't?<br /><br />People here have complained that it is historically innacurate, but what epic fiction isn't? And really, who's pretending that this is a tome to cull some kind of real understanding of ancient Egypt. Nobody's trying to claim that Raiders of the Lost Ark is a misrepresentation of history, and this novel should be comparably exempt from such criticisms. It's meant to be fun, so be warned by the overly cynical critics of the book; you're not going to learn anything. It's a book meant to entertain, so enjoy it and don't over analyze it.<br /><br />And, at all costs, avoid the terrible sequel \\"Warlock.\\"l costs, avoid the terrible sequel \\"Warlock.\\"	2005-10-13

Starting with Paul's childhood and formative years to the day of his untimely departure, the book captures Paul's deep convictions and principles for social justice and progressive changes, which had forever altered the domestic politics landscape. One could double the biography as a platform for Paul's radical, oftentimes effective mechanism \\"...for the little guy versus the big guy.\\" In a nutshell, Mr. Lofy succeeded in presenting Paul's bold resolve to espouse populist idealism in sharply divided American politics by foraying into academic politics and community activism and inevitably the Senate, as if he knew that, quoting the start of a chapter, \\"to be sure, mere passion, however genuinely felt is not enough.\\" Presumably written on the behalf of many, this book is an embodiment of Paul's passion and integrity to remain genuine in the face of victories celebrated and failures embraced with dignity and humor. Resonating Paul's strength and vigor, the book offers lessons in life and leadership for everybody, regardless of affiliations. From the wresting mat to unorthodox campaign strategies, Paul's uncanny ability to rise in times of uncertainty inspired his constituents to \\"raise hell,\\" like the book asserts Paul liked to say. However, that transpires the impulsivity Paul had acknowledged from time to time while remaining true to himself not to make decisions he did not believe in. In calculating courage in action, Paul showed us how, quoting Max Weber, he \\"...would not have attained the possible unless time and again he had reached out for the impossible.\\" Conclusion can be made that the book is not just about Paul's impact on politics but also his passion for everybody. In the same vein, the book would share that when Paul visited a deaf awareness fair, he marveled atsign language and asked how to sign \\"beautiful.\\" Like the book, that gesture of genuine appreciation for humanity Paul had so revered throughout his life could not be better exemplified.	2005-10-13

It tells its scientific classification and habits.<br /><br />It is the section on the history of the Cod fisheries that I find to be most fascinating.  The Cod is shown as the lure which drew the first Europeans to North America.  Rapidly becoming a staple in the diets of many, Cod became a pillar of he economies of several regions as well as a major commodity in the fabled Triangle Trade.  Access to Cod became a causa bellae, which it remains to our day, and a factor in treaty negotiations.<br /><br />As the history enters more modern times, the narrative focuses more on the depletion of the Cod stocks.  The effects of the failure of the Cod stock on fishing communities in the North Eastern United States and Maritime Canada, as well as on British Cuisine, and on the take of other species, make for interesting reading.  Cod is identified as the major natural resource of Iceland.  The shifting of national policies along with the extent of offshore fishing rights is closely studied.  The book concludes with a collection of regional Cod recipes.<br /><br />Often we think of human history as an exclusively human story.  \\"Cod\\" reminds us of the interdependence between man and the sea's creatures.	2005-10-13

He finds great success academically until he is awakened by a rebellious and free-spirited friend, who makes him rethink his drive to succeed on someone else's terms.  This story seems to be going somewhere- as the boy falls out of the academic system he ultimately finds some new satisfaction in manual labor and finds a second chance to experience childhood.  However, the story ends in a melodramatically tragic way, without exploring the boy's conflict in any real depth.<br /><br />Hesse makes some insightfully cutting remarks about academia's taming of young genius \\"like a jungle... cleared and its growth thwarted,\\" and manipulation of students as vessels to store teachers' ideas.  However, Hesse just as often gets distracted in irrelevant details and overly brief development of flat characters.<br /><br />This is certainly not near at the level of Hesse's best works, though this is still early in his career (1906).  Also, though there are thematic comparisons to Catcher in the Rye, this is an otherwise very reserved and repressed writing style typical of its time.	2005-10-13

Lovecraft's writing, Stanley C. Sargent firmly establishes himself as a master of his craft--a compelling storyteller in his own right and an important torchbearer for the legacy of Lovecraft's Mythos.  The best tale in this collection is \\"The Black Brat of Dunwich,\\" an insightful reinterpretation of Lovecraft's \\"The Dunwich Horror\\" that meshes so well with the original one cannot help but think Sargent found the key for cracking a sinister code Lovecraft intentionally wrote as a hidden subtext.  It almost begins to feel that one needs Sargent's later work in order to appreciate the antecedent text on all of its multi-faceted levels.  I don't want to overstate the point, but I wish future collections reprinting Lovecraft's original tale could all include \\"Black Brat\\" side-by-side with it.  That being said, Sargent's story may lose some of its relevance for the uninitiated. <br /> <br />Most good Mythos fiction is not only steeped in a sense of otherworldly terror and the macabre, but is also solidly grounded in real-world history.  \\"Nyarlatophis\\" is no exception; Sargent's knowledge of ancient Egyptian history and mythology appears exhaustive, and this tale--the longest in the collection--was obviously well researched.  In some ways, it may actually have been too well researched, as the first third of the story is rather ponderous as the reader wades through what often feels more like an historical essay than a novella.  But again, readers who stick with this tale will be glad they did, as the pace picks up significantly half-way through, and the dark, cataclysmic ending is all the more powerful for the grounding in history Sargent provided earlier on. <br /> <br />As for the remainder of this collection, it is a varied mix: an effectively disturbing science fiction tale that brings the Mythos to the stars, a prequel and a sequel to two other Lovecraft classics that also stand on their own as powerfully creepynarratives, a handful of comic takes on HPL themes (fun but probably my own least favorite pieces in this bunch), and one or two twilight-zone style horror pieces with only very loose connections to the Mythos per se.  These stories are handsomely illustrated throughout, including a drawing or two by Sargent himself.  The author also throws in nine of his whimsical poems, written in a style that blends Edward Gorey with Shel Silversetein.  Two of Sargent's non-fiction essays complete this set, one that is really little more than a collection of anecdotes about the possible influences of Lovecraft on the EVIL DEAD films, and the other of which provides some fascinating insights into Lovecraft's biographical self by finding clues in his stories. <br /> <br />For all those enthusiastic minions of things Lovecraftian out there (among whom I count myself one), THE TAINT OF LVOECRAFT is a book that should have a prominent place on your shelf.  For the rest of you, TAINT might well serve as a good introduction to the expanded Mythos, but if nothing else, it offers a handful of diverting tales.	2005-10-13

History knows the true value of this.  <br /> <br />One correction I want to make is to the gentleman who refers to what someone else pointed out in reference to Rudolph Steiner--what he called the ETHERIC body. That is an exclusive term that only Steiner used. \\"Ethereal\\" body sounds like a \\"new age\\" term--but essentially, I am not sure what this man is trying to say that it is \\"outmoded \\"--that's like saying spirituality is \\"old hat \\". You know? <br /> <br />Anthroposophy (Steiner's term) was started as a decided departure from Theosophy--mainly because Steiner was not interested in the \\"hero-worship\\" of the young J. Krishnamurti. (Krishnamurti later left Theosophy, too , and went on his own). Steiner is considered a luminary of the first order--there has been no one quite this man; this, I want to say, very modest and self-effacing man, whose works are in the hundreds. Thousands of his lectures have been turned into books. (see the Anthroposophic Press). He is \\"heady\\" stuff, and not easy to read (at least, for me). <br /> <br />With that said: I visited Tolle's website. Read his \\"interview\\" on his new book.

Books 10 and 11 both make me think of book 4. <br /> <br />\\"Book TEN makes you think of book FOUR?!?!?\\", you say?  Well, yes... specifically, that part where the Shaido clan-chief-wannabe was in the heart of Rhuidean and was tearing his eyes from their sockets rather than go on seeing what he was seeing.  Pretty much sums up my experience of reading book 10. <br /> <br />Knife of Dreams reminds me of book 4 in a different way - the story lines make PROGRESS.  Things happen.  Book 10 was painful, with the last chapter being the only required reading in the whole thing.  KoD isn't as good as book 4, though (IMO), because there are so many story lines.  In earlier books a story line would split off, but for every two leading off you usually had one or two coming back in.  But if you have 10 story lines (for example) sharing 700 pages, you obviously don't get as much progress made in each one as you would with just 4 to follow.  I understand that's the nature of the series at this point, but there you are - I'm less satisfied with the overall progress.  That said, what progress IS made has a much more furious pace that in recent volumes, reminding me once again of The Shadow Rising (ie, book 4) and leading me to a final rating of 4 stars.  I'd give it 4.5 if I could - it's really not the fault of this particular installment that it has so many story lines to deal with. <br /> <br />If this seems more like a review of the pace of the book than its content... it is.  Had the first couple of reviews I read indicated this was a repeat of book 10, I think I would have just went to message boards for plot summaries and spoilers rather than spend a few hours reading it.  When the series came out, I was in university and had much more time for reading.  Now I have a job and two kids, and I'm a different audience than I was back then ... I can't devote hours and hours of my life to reading a book that offers a few minutes of intrigue.  So the pace in book 11 was my number 1 concern.  Jordan has already shown he can weave an intricate and compelling tale, so that was never in doubt for me.  He certainly did not fail to deliver just that in this new novel, and I once again am eagerly waiting for the next book in the series - Thanks, RJ!	2005-10-13

When I read it, I was so glad I had.  Unlike some classics, this book truly deserves every award that it has gotten.  It's a perfect example of how a book can do things that a movie, even a good one, can't.  It uses beautiful writing and an interesting and heart-warming story to confront some very hard issues.  This book is definitely a must-read.	2005-10-13

It covers a wide range of system administration subjects and goes way beyond just the essentials. <br /> <br />Over the years, I have administered several multi-user UNIX, Linux, and FreeBSD servers. I believed that I knew the essentials, because if I did not, I would not have been able to do my job all these years. I wanted to see if the things that I learned by experience, often the hard way, are included in \\"Essential System Administration\\". Sure enough, they were all there. Not only that, but they are laid out simply, without much unnecessary technical details, and accompanied by numerous examples and anecdotal encounters by the author. If you read one section, you would be able to apply the knowledge and skills that it describes right away. For instance, you don't need to read the entire manual of procmail in order to write some effective mail filters; chapter 9 has a section on \\"Mail Filtering with procmail\\" that covers the essentials. <br /> <br />One impressive feature of this book is that it covers how to do things on a variety of operating system including various flavours of UNIX, Linux, and BSD. In the past, I often ran into a situation where I knew how to do something on FreeBSD, but did not know how to accomplish the same task on Solaris. With this book by my side, I will not have this problem again. <br /> <br />Another feature of the book is that it covers a very, VERY, very wide variety of administrative topics: from every day system management, to operating system internals, to various devices, to backing up, to scheduling, to rebuilding the kernel. I am yet to find a task, whether typical or atypical, that is not covered in \\"Essential System Administration\\". <br /> <br />But wait, are not most, if not all, of these topics encountered in a user's daily life? Are mail filters limited onlyto system administrators? Of course not! Many users organize their email by defining personal mail filters. And what about devices? Every user who uses a Linux-based desktop computer goes through the frustration of configuring devices at some point. \\"Essential System Administration\\" is really written to be useful for any UNIX/Linux/BSD user, not only system administrators. <br /> <br />On a second thought, any one who owns a computer running UNIX/Linux/BSD is the administrator of one's system. Not only that, but anyone who uses one of these system must still manage their own account and perform tasks such as scheduling tasks, emailing, and printing. \\"Essential System Administration\\" was not written for system administrators in the traditional sense -- someone who is paid to administer an expensive system with hundreds or thousands of users -- but for the administrator in the broad sense -- any user who wishes to perform some management tasks on their system. <br /> <br />\\"Essential System Administration\\" is an invaluable resource for anyone who wishes to become an expert in system administration, and is a useful resource for users of these systems. I give this book 4.5 out of 5.	2005-10-13

The short stories and the central narrative were originally intended to be separate works, but he just decided to combine them.  This helps explain why most of the short stories don't really have much of anything to do with anything else in the book.  It's funny, I think this book would have been better received if it had just been a collection of short stories, cause now people are looking for things that aren't even supposed to be there. (Such as how you don't know any of the characters.  That falls into the 'true but irrelevant' category.)  Personally, I think it works best this way, and the central narrative wouldn't work nearly as well on its own, even though the stories would. (And, the stories themselves are already by far the better part.)  Still, it all ends up connecting well enough simply because of the stylistic and thematic similarities throughout the book. (i.e. violence, gross-out, death, perversion, world turned upside down, minimalist writing style etc.)  The central story is not particularly fascinating, but I think it works pretty well as a bridge between the individual stories.  If you think of it as a novel it doesn't work too well, but as a series of interludes I think it's pretty effective.  It's got some of the most gruesome-funny moments in any of his novels, and presents a nice microcosm for one of the central themes of the book. (Violence and destruction are central to human nature.)  But anyway, you just need to understand, coming in that this is primarily a collection of short stories, rather than a novel.  Most people still won't be pleased with this, as the novel is the preferred genre of the age, but I've always been a short story man, so it's perfect for me.<br /><br />Fortunately, the stories are generallly excellent, and always interesting.  'Guts' is nearly as disgusting as advertised, no small feat.  'Slumming' and 'Footwork' are two classic examples of reality turned upside down. (The first is about wealthy socialites who moonlight as homeless people, the latter about the use of New Age medicine/therapy for unseemly and destructive purposes.)  'Swan Song' is a predictable but gut wrenching tale of the media's obsession with self-destruction. 'Dog Years' is an amusingly perverse sick joke which cannot be specifically described with out giving it away. 'Civil Twilight' is one of the very best stories, about an unknown, unseen destruction falling down on the city, and the sort of paranoia and hysteria that follows.  It's perhaps the most horror-oriented story of the collection, and opens with some wonderful Lovecraftian ideas, even if the explaination proves to be more mundane. 'Speaking Bitterness' is an unnerving story of an encounter between a group of scarred, disturbed women and a supposed transsexual.  'Hot Potting' is told as an old-fashioned ghost story, with some truly haunting imagery.  The heart of the book is found in the 4 story series from Mrs. Clark, primarily about the slow death of her daughter Cassandra.  'The Nightmare Box' is probably my favorite story in the book, about a, well, Nightmare Box that permanently warps anyone who looks in it.  I'll admit, the central conceit of that story isn't particularly great, but it's a perfect display of the slow build up to the revelation of what actually is inside the box.  'Obsolete' is the final story of the book, and is another one which can't be described at all with out giving it all away.  It's a fun one though, and far different from what came before.  I suppose that's enough specifics.  None of the 23 stories is remotely close to bad.<br /><br />The book has a number of poems in it.  None of them are particularly remarkable, but they're short enough that they don't really detract, and provide a nice transition to the short stories.  Also, there are a number of nice lines and images spread out through them.<br /><br />Palahniuk's critics love to dismiss his work as 'adolescent', a classic way to denigrate a work with out actually making an argument. (And Palahniuk's not an adolescent, nor is he an idiot, so this argument doesn't do much, even if it actually meant anything in and of itself.)  Certainly, his work is usually sensational and extreme, but I can't really imagine why this should be a bad thing.  I guess truly great writers don't need to say anything novel or interesting.  They can just write bland, humdrum crap and it'll be fabulous because of their inner brilliance.  Well, you guys can all go read Henry James if you want, but I'll stick with something interesting.  And 'Haunted' is about as interesting as is gets.s critics love to dismiss his work as 'adolescent', a classic way to denigrate a work with out actually making an argument.

Nice,  grim account of academic life:  \\"I'll never have a good time like that again.  Just tenure.\\"  A moving account of various relationships;  refreshingly, although most are romantic none are the mommy-daddy-marriage-baby-return-to-the-patriarchal-family.  The rest of these reviews seem to say a lot about the plot, so I will simply add that although this book does not have flawless racial politics (and what book does, really) it is one of the few character-driven fantasy novels by white writers where a significant number of the characters are not white, and plausibly not white.   Phrases and images without number from this book have passed into my mental lexicon: \\"the fastest nostalgia in the West\\", \\"Nay, of us two, who's to be the judge of steel?\\", the fried rabbit restaurant (\\"Bunny Buckets\\", \\"Hare Pieces\\", and \\"Thumper's Forest Flavoring\\"), and the only even faintly plausible-seeming magical duel I have ever read.  (I leave out the more emotionally engaging stuff, of which there is plenty)  I am flabbergasted that any reviewer--however nostalgic for The Last Unicorn--could fail to appreciate this book.  Of course, a lot of people are essentially embarassed by fantasy novels, so perhaps reviewers who could accept a fable about a unicorn were too embarassed about reading an actual fantasy novel to be able to appreciate it.	2005-10-13

A strange thing is happening in the seas of the world: a gigantic sea monster is terrorizing and sometimes sinking ships. The US government assembles a team of experts and sails around the world to discover the monster and catch it. Among them are two French scientists, Prof. Arronax and his assistant Conseil, and a Canadian harpooner, Ned Land. One day they fall to the sea while chasing the thing, and then are astonished when the monster rescues them. Alas, it turns out it's not a monster, but a machine that can travel under the surface of the waters. That is, a submarine, nonexistent at the time the book was written. So the three men become the prisoners of the enigmatic Captain Nemo and his crew. The \\"Nautilus\\" is a self-supporting device, lavishly decorated and the work of a genius, a strange one. The central question throughout the book remains: Why have Nemo and his people rejected all contact with their fellow human beings? What happened to him and to them to escape the world and become lonely travellers of the underseas? Mystery. During many months, our heroes travel around the globe, and in the way they discover Atlantida, hunt in submerged forests, rescue a pearl-gatherer, rest in a submerged volcano, and fight aborigines and giant squids. Prof. Arronax classifies and describes every creature they encounter, which slows down the reading between adventures.<br /><br />I took one star out of the book because it lacks a central feature of any great work of literary art: character development. To reach the highest literary glory, Verne lacks psychological depth, the exploration of human beings' motivations. I would have loved to know Nemo's story, his reasons for doing what he does. But it doesn't matter much. To read Verne is to come back home, to turn back the time and be a kid again, flying to that moment when one discovers the infinite possibilities of literature, chief among them the chance to live other lives and see the world anew. Verne and his characters have a unique charm, and in this book the fascination od the ocean is added.	2005-10-13

Douglas Adams in his one of his possibly best know books really out did himself. In this adventure a boring simpleton named Arthur Dent living on the planet we call earth has befriended a guy named Ford Perfect, who is not as he claimed from earth but from a planet called Betelgeuse. Where he was sent from to do research for \\"The Hitchhikers Guide to the Universe\\" (it's a book where it has everything and anything that you could possibly need to know about the universe). Ford tells Arthur that he isn't from around here.  He isn't from Earth. In telling Arthur this he also tells him that the earth is about to end.  <br /> And since they have gotten to be really close friends he takes Arthur with him when he hitches a ride with the Vogan ships (these are what the aliens are called that destroyed our planet earth). Vogan's in particular don't like hitchhikers very much. So they kick them off the ship, shortly after they get on. And by pure chance they get picked up. And the story goes from there. <br /> Now that I've told you how the book starts I'll leave it up to you to read the rest of the book. And if you read this book, then watch the movie.

After finishing it a few minutes ago, I feel very anxious to read the next book, Rise of Endymion.   <br />Simmons seems pretty good at combining religious and philosophical themes with a far future fantasy, and at keeping the reader's attention.  The epic-style story structure and powerfully creative settings make it a fun read, but there are three major flaws present in the book: <br />First, Simmons makes way too many references to present-day Earth culture and history for a far-future sci fi novel.  He worships the figures of John Keats, Teilhard de Chardin, and Frank Lloyd Wright to an unusual degree. <br />Second, the characters are all predictable and annoying, with the major exception of Father Captain Federico De Soya.  This character is incredibly deep and multi-dimensional, as his position as the border between good and evil allows.  However, all the straight protagonists and antagonists are just plain flat and the comic relief \\"ship\\" character is not amusing. <br />Thirdly, and this will sound stupid until you read the book, if I have to read the phrase \\"I admit that\\" one more time I'm going to scream.  Seriously, it seems like every fourth sentence starts with those three words.  That's just plain carelessness on the part of the writer. <br />Otherwise, it's a gripping and thought-provoking read.  Recommended.	2005-10-13

This is the best book I have ever read on Foucault, no contest--though one must be clear that Halperin is EXPLICITLY NOT attempting any general and comprehensive explanation of Foucault's life work and thought, which Halperin makes quite clear, though there seems to be some confusion below regarding this point.  In fact, the tone of some of the reviews only serve as a demonstration of some of Halperin's points.   <br /> <br />My main criticism is that I would go even a little further than Halperin with respect to Foucault's actual purpose or mission in _The History of Sexuality_.  I would say that, with volumes two and three, Foucault has shifted his purpose from a general \\"history\\" (hence the title) of the rise of \\"sexuality\\" to a deconstructive and very narrow focus on certain discourses in antiquity that ostensibly SEEM to mirror our own while actually being quite alien to it.  It just so happens that these ancient discourses are about men.  From this perspective, all the complaining of a small but very loud minority of feminists merely reflects a failure to understand what Foucault was doing.  He wasn't trying to give us a general history; rather, he became fascinated by how the ancient world's most familiar discourses (which are about men) could, in fact, be extremely different, by the demonstration and analysis of that difference.  As for general history, Foucault repeatedly refers the reader to Dover's _Greek Homosexuality_, which was published between volumes one and two, and which he just as repeatedly tells us he accepts in basic outline.  Feeling there was no longer an urgent need for a \\"history,\\" he gave us his actual second and third volumes.  Should he have given us a hint he was changing course?  He did!--in the introduction of the second volume.  Readers need to learn to be a bit more active--though, clearly, as original, good, and rigorous as the thinking and analysis may be, it does make for a rather uniquely structured set of books.	2005-10-13

I developed this interest in my early teens at a time when the country I was living in was going through massive changes. One of the things I learned during this time was that the truth is often hard to come by when studying history particularly when you are living it. What I thought was truth turned out not to be so true and at the same time lies abounded from the other side. When it comes to the life of Nelson I have read much and although my interest today is still the Victory I decided to find a decent biography of Nelson to add to my library. Roger Knight has, in my opinion, told the truth about Nelson in the most complete way I have ever come across in a very easy to read style and backed up by a prolific bibliography. Two thirds of the book is the biography of Nelson and the rest consists of a chronology of Nelson's life, notes on the people in his life, notes about the ships he sailed in and a glossary. Roger Knight dispels some of the myths that have grown up about Nelson but does not detract from the outstanding leader of men that Nelson was. Nelson's failings are not glossed over in favor of his greatness as some have tended to do. Knight has not belittled Nelson to the point of saying that the battle of Trafalgar was nearly lost because of his vanity. Nelson was human like the rest of us, and this book shows the life of a true leader who overcame his weaknesses be they moral, personal or physical to rise above the norm and excel. This book was written to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar and is, as far as I am concerned, the most balanced story of the life of Nelson there is.	2005-10-13

Well, I hate to be the one who \\"breaks up the party\\", but I was dissapointed when I finished reading this book, the first one I have read by this author. Part of reason I didn't really like it may be due to the fact that I already own the movie (from Hallmark Hall of Fame - I first saw it on TV), and have watched it every year since 1999. I am aware that the book came first, but I discovered it second. (This may be one of those things that you will like whichever you experienced first, I don't know.) That being said, I may have expected more from the book than the average reader has not seen the movie.<br /><br />The main difference between the book and the movie was it's family friendliness. The movie was very sweet and the romance was completely clean (no sex, just kissing) and could have been rated \\"G\\". Just a very nice, heartwarming movie that you could watch with your kids. But the book had several sex scenes in it (some of which were fairly explicit.) I know that it won't bother everyone, but it did bother me.<br /><br />However, whether or not you liked the book, I can almost guarantee that you will like the movie. You can find it right here on the Amazon website, on DVD or VHS.	2005-10-13

With that question she delves into issues related to food, class, and economics from her unique and powerful perspective as the NY Times restaurant reviewer.  The reader cheers her reviews of Le Cirque, Tavern on the Green and The Box Tree, in which she took powerful restaurants to task for their failure to treat ALL patrons (rather than just the most well-known or privileged) with the respect and graciousness for which they have paid.  My husband and I now have the luxury of being able to eat at such restaurants from time-to-time (though certainly not regularly), and we usually happily get what we paid for.  But we *have* had occasional negative experiences like Reichl describes, and have seen others have them as well.  As Reichl recognizes, many people \\"save up\\" to eat at these establishments, or visit them for very \\"special occasions,\\" only to be treated poorly.  Restaurants who do not give the \\"four star treatment\\" to *every* guest (rather than the select few) are NOT, by definition, \\"four star\\" and do not deserve to be treated as though they are.     Taking this point one step further, Reichl also uses her reviews to make New Yorkers understand that truly good cuisine need not be expensive, and need not be French.  Her positive reviews of ethnic cuisine are educational and delightful.  In short, Reichl might be seen as the democratizer of the NY Times restaurant reviews.    However, at various points in the narrative Reichl seems to suffer from snobbery of her own (which she largely fails to recognize).  Her behavior at dinner with the man who paid for a meal with her at a charity auction-- showing up his food knowledge, expressing extreme frustration that he wantedto eat at a nice restaurant-- and her nasty comments about the young couple next to her at another restaurant, for example, exhibited a sense of superiority that seems to run beneath the surface of her narrative.  She acknowledges her poor behavior on these occasions through the words of her friends or her husband, but it would have been nice to see a bit more recognition of her limitations in her own words or discussion about her growth from these experiences.      In addition, the deep \\"transformations\\" that Reichl claims overtook her when she was in disguise seem contrived.  While I understand the need for the disguises, I (again) do not understand her need to \\"become\\" these characters and while \\"in character\\" treat others poorly, such as by leaving a cab driver no tip or making rude comments about others.          While I found the book enjoyable, Reichl generally likeable, and the restaurant reviews fascinating, Reichl offended me by including her negative views on, and review of, Windows on the World.  Writing in 2005, Reichl unquestionably knows that Windows on the World perished in the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001, together with approximately 80 members of its dedicated staff who were on duty that morning, including its executive pastry chef and countless workers who undoubtedly took pride in their work at what was a pillar of New York.  They are the images we see in news coverage waving towels out the windows of the top floor, begging for rescue.  We have seen some of their family members speak on television about the delight some of them took from working at such a renowned establishment.  Her inclusion of Windows seemed totally unnecessary except to tell her story about dinner with the \\"obnoxious\\" charity guest she could not stand.  Did she really need to kick these people, or the memories of these people, while they were down?  How hard would it have been to edit out?         The book is very entertaining, and I applaud Reichl for democratizing the Times' restaurant reviews.  I just wish she had been a little more thoughtful about what details she chose to include, and how she chose to frame them.	2005-10-13

Well, the joke's on me.  It's so bad in so many ways. The plot is disgusting for its lack of movement.  Names are mispelled two pages apart, he says thirty motorcycles are too many to estimate the number of, then he goes on to name every rider and hir or her group, a number that clearly adds to more than thirty. Half way through the book we are forced to remeet every person we already met, and then for the remainder to travel to every place and remeet every city and character we already met.  And in this we discover nothing new, we already knew or guessed the majority of it, and because at this point we neither trust his writing ability nor the sense of his fictional character, we really don't care what happens next.  Sorry but even the media touted sex is worthless.  Irving wrote too long a book in desperate need of a good editor.

I checked my local library system, they didn't have so put in an InterLibrary Loan request and within a month a paperback from Queen's Park Library in London reached me. <br />This novel seems to be written more by Rosenberg than Feist though I haven't read much by Feist. It was good to see Kethol, Pirojil, and Durine back together again as in more recent Rosenberg novels some of them have been killed off. <br />Reading all of Rosenberg novels that I could find, it is interesting to see how the three mercenaries start as minor players and as the series progress become more major characters. <br />I have been going through some personal reviews of my own thoughts and find the musings of these guys occasionally inspirational. <br />Anyway, this is a nice novel. Sometimes seems a little pointless but does point out differences in what people of different socio-economic levels expect and actually get. The real scumbags seem to be amongst the nobility but some show decent traits.  <br />The murder comes late in the book, Pirojil's empirical methods provide a likely murderer who gets killed after the accusation by another nobleman. The Purojil figures out who really did the murder and convinces him to suicide but first writing out a note of confession. <br />All in all, a good read! <br />	2005-10-13

Snepp, a CIA analyst, was an eye witness to the events leading up to the American evacuation on April 30, 1975. The CIA took offense at Snepp's account and I understand he has never received a penny in royalties for the book.      \\"Decent Interval\\" tells the story of the last three years of the American war in Vietnam, but most of the book is focused on the North Vietnamese offensive of Spring 1975 that led to the fall of the South Vietnamese government and the sudden, panicky flight of thousands of Americans from Vietnam.   The story is told as seen from Snepp's eyes in Vietnam although he obviously interviewed hundreds of people in coming up with a full, complex account of who was doing what in those last frantic days in which the Americans were preparing to evacuate -- but hoping against hope that some sort of graceful exit could be negotiated.  It couldn't and Snepp's theme is that people like Henry Kissinger and Ambassador Graham Martin gambled with lives -- especially Vietnamese lives -- by holding on to delusion too long.     Unlike Iraq, Vietnam was a picturesque war with lots of sex, booze, drugs, and rock n roll mixed in with the violence and human tragedy. \\"Decent Interval\\" captures the compelling atmosphere of the country. The book is often confusing with its plethora of characters, places, and scenes -- not unlike the chaotic situation in Vietnam.  There is abundant heroism and nobility in these pages, as there is stupidity and venality.  Ambassador Martin is probably the chief villain, but one has to feel a certain twinge of regret for him, thrust as he was into a no win situation. When writing this book, Snepp still burned with disgust and shame at the ignomious American rout -- and settles some scores with those he blames.                Smallchief	2005-10-13

Sure, we know that death is inevitable for us all somewhere far off in our wished-for future. So we draw up wills and provide for the \\"rainy day.\\" And we expect that there will be a process called \\"grieving.\\" But as my own late mother used to say, repeating the Irish wisdom, \\"We'll deal with it when we have to.\\" <br /> <br />THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING by Joan Didion is her memoir of what she went through in dealing with the unthinkable. On December 30, 2003, Didion and her husband, writer John Gregory Dunne, returned home from the hospital where their only daughter, Quintana Roo, lay in a coma, suffering from severe pneumonia and septic shock. While sitting down to dinner, Dunne had a massive fatal heart attack. They were 31 days shy of their 40th wedding anniversary. <br /> <br />Didion begins this book with the simplest of words: \\"Life changes fast. Life changes in the instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends. The question of self-pity.\\" <br /> <br />Quintana would spend 24 days in intensive care after her father's death. Two months later, she collapsed and was rushed into surgery after developing a life-threatening hematoma on her brain. (Sadly, Quintana passed away from an abdominal infection in August. Asked by the New York Times if she would change the manuscript to include her daughter's death, Didion replied, \\"It's finished.\\") <br /> <br />Two such catastrophic events happening almost simultaneously would be enough to test the endurance of anyone. And, indeed, Didion writes that this period \\"cut loose any fixed idea that I had ever had about death, about illness, about probability and luck, about good fortune and bad, about marriage and children and memory, about grief, about the ways in which people do and do not deal with the fact that life ends, about the shallowness of sanity,about life itself.\\" <br /> <br />Writers write. It is the way we decode and make sense of that which often does not make sense. Didion explains, \\"In time of trouble, I had been trained since childhood, read, learn, work it up, go to the literature. Information was control.\\" <br /> <br />She discovered that the literature on grief, going back to Freud in 1917, is relatively sparse for such a universal ordeal. When told at the hospital that her husband was dead, a social worker described her reaction as being that of a \\"cool customer,\\" as if that was somehow reassuring. Didion writes, \\"I wondered what an uncool customer would be allowed to do. Break down? Require sedation? Scream?\\" <br /> <br />What followed for her was a year of magical thinking, an attempt to change the narrative by an act of will. She couldn't throw out John's shoes simply because he would need them when he came back. \\"Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it,\\" she writes. \\"We do not expect to be literally crazy, cool customers who believe that their husband is about to return and need his shoes.\\" <br /> <br />Memory turned into a \\"vortex\\" that could suddenly sweep her away. And here we find Didion's powerful descriptive writing and superb eye for detail. She drives past an LA movie theater and suddenly it was 1967, and she and John are at the premiere for The Graduate. Or she recalls buying her \\"short white silk\\" wedding dress in San Francisco at the exact same time that JFK was being assassinated in Dallas.  <br /> <br />Didion, author of five novels and seven works of nonfiction, is one of America's greatest writers and essayists. Her two collections of essays about the 1960s, SLOUCHING TOWARDS BETHLEHEM and THE WHITE ALBUM, are essential reading for anybody who wants to understand how America came apart during that turbulent decade. They also should be read by anyone interested in good writing and journalism. Didion is a true master of the craft. <br /> <br />THE YEAR OFMAGICAL THINKING is Didion at her best, covering her most painful story. And she answers \\"the question of self-pity\\" by not engaging it. It is impossible not to feel overwhelming sadness after losing the person you loved and spent virtually everyday with for 40 years. But she brings to her loss her journalistic honesty and the ability to search for and find the deeper truth, no matter how unsatisfying that truth may be. <br /> <br />And in so doing, she not only manages to liberate herself from her year of magical thinking but also to provide something of a guide for the rest of us as well. In addition to being a wonderful memoir, this book is an invaluable meditation for that time when the far-off future suddenly becomes now and the rainy day turns into a deluge. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Tom Callahan	2005-10-13

I'm shying away from 5 stars, however, because I don't believe there is as much practical application as fans have imagined (or wished) there was.  The Tipping Point is more of a post-game wrap-up, showing how ideas, trends travel, but it isn't really going to teach you how to make your idea/product/self into the next big thing.	2005-10-13

I have taken a Cisco CCNA Networking class, and I believe, though I have not completed this book, that it is significantly better.  I enjoyed starting at the application layer.  It also explains things in a much less clinical and detached manner.  One thing that always irked me about Cisco was the ridiculously dumbed down explanations, the information was also very sparse.  This book goes into significant detail.  I really think it's the difference between wanting to actually study the material, and wanting to know enough to pass a cert test.  Which, incidentally, Cisco does not even do very well either. <br /> <br />One thing that I dislike about this book is the lack of a glossary of terms or acronym definition listing.  I did however buy a library edition that has a billion type-o's and misspellings.  But if you have the regular edition and this is a problem I suggest searching \\"networking acronyms\\" on google, there are some good websites for help.	2005-10-13

Maybe that should be in another book, hopefully a sequel. <br /> <br />I would have liked to see sections on: <br /> <br />1) Common problems with home made systems  (complexity, hidden holes, gaps, etc.).  Example - introducing a weak NT to a 2/1 system.  What do you have to change? <br /> <br />2) Problems and evolutionary fixes to some modern systems.  What were the initial problems of Precision, how did it evolve to corrcet them?  Learning from the past to avoid future problems. <br /> <br />3) Checklist of things to test and look out for. <br /> <br />4) problem hands to bid.  Test your system against these 100 hands to see how well you do.  The hands would have a rough frequency of occurence and how well they are handled by current popular systems like 2/1, Polish Club, Precision, etc.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

I had previously read the first few chapters of Ghost on the web and the non-stop action was top notch!  But little did I know what was coming until I bought the book.  The graphic sexual nature was only hinted at in the chapters available to read online.  Little did I know how graphic the descriptions were going to get.<br /><br />Once I got the book and continued reading I realized that this book was NOT what I thought it would be from the sample online.  The graphic sexual nature of the book was WAY too over the top.  This book did not 'fit' with what I have come to expect from a Ringo novel and I would not recommend this novel.  It would have been better to gloss over the S&M with more focus on the action as opposed to the focus on the sexual details written.<br /><br />John writes great military /Science fiction stories, and even though I did not enjoy this book, the action sequences were well written and exciting.<br /><br />I would recommend any of John's other books just not this one.  If you are still interested in reading this novel, I would highly recommend checking this novel out of the library first before purchasing it.	2005-10-13

US	46134316	R1LC1ZJTRJECNU	1561452912	139457384	Shadow of a Doubt	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Good Book For Teens	I picked up this book after my sixteen year old nephew, who is a Goth, told me that he took a lot of tips from this YA novel, tips on how to dress, and what makeup to wear, and what attitudes to put on, to hide his own shyness and to make sense of a confusing adult world.  The book relates the story of a young boy, Shadow, who has to deal with the trauma of losing a beloved older brother.  It reminds me very much of the famous S E Hinton book, Rumble Fish, and to a lesser degree, THE OUTSIDERS, for all three books are about what happens when your adored older brother turns out to have feet of clay?  in SHADOW OF A DOUBT (cute name), Shadow Thompson was just a tad when bro Daniel ran away from home, leaving his mom and dad desolate and depending on him for amusement, but being too grief-stricken really to attend to his needs, so he retreated into the wonderland of Goth, or maybe not retreated, perhaps \\"discovered his subject position\\" would be a better way to put it.  He wears dark glasses, even indoors, so nobody can see his eyes and guess what his feelings are.<br /><br />Daniel comes back at the beginning of the book-wanted for murder!  I thought this was a little bit of overkill.  Couldn't he have just come back period?  Nothing else in the book would have changed.  I notice that with the novels of Rottman.  She always tosses in more than the book can really handle, or more than they need.  There was the one book I remember about the girl who was in high school with her boyfriend who's more of a horndog than she can handle, and between that and her swimming career the book would have been quite full already, and then she had to have yet another plot about uncaring parents who saddle the poor girl with an older brother who has Downs syndrome (and still wants to swim).  Too much!<br /><br />But in SHADOW OF A DOUBT, young Shadow has to now cope with the law and wanting to protect his brother, rather like the Hinton novels.  My own nephew adores the book and even said that he would consider joining the debating team, after reading this book.  Well, he calls it the \\"forensics team\\" and it turns out he thought \\"forensics\\" is what it is on his favorite TV shows BONES and CSI, for his dearest wish is to grow up and have a job relating to dead bodies and murder, I think he'll be in for a surprise when he joins the debate team and there's no rotting flesh involved.<br /><br />I would give Rottman's novel an A Plus for trying, but in the end it's not very involving.  However I am over fifteen and perhaps young readers (its target audience) would ignore its lack of plausibility and instead groove on Shadow's fashion sense and growing love interest.  Perhaps it will also restore teenager's interests in debating teams.n said that he would consider joining the debating team, after reading this book.

This book is exactly what I expected from the authors - a well written, useful resource.  I have over 10 years playing many editions of D+D and wanted to see what some of the experts had to say and to see their opinions on some of the top 10 lists.  I have gleaned some useful information for myself, a person who knows quite a bit, but definately not all of it.  Having bought over 40 different resource books, I would rank this among my top 10. <br />   Another very, very obvious use for this book is the benefit it gives newcomers to the game.  When 3rd edition first came out, my gaming group drudged through the book for many a session before we finally started to understand the new concepts.  D&D for Dummies puts the new ideas, combat maneuvers, some spells, and the confusing Attack of Opportunities in true Dummy book plain English.  It is becoming a semi-mandatory read for newbies in my gaming group, it is that useful.  It gives a great foundation before attacking the more detailed Players Handbook.  <br />   My review is slightly biased, but not overmuch.  I am a fan of both authors, the Books for Dummies series (of which I own 8), and obviously D&D.  I will say, that if the book was a waste of money, like about 10 D&D resource books I own, I would definately give a negative review.  I am glad, however, to give this a high review. <br />	2005-10-13

I love the layout -- starting with the basics and working up to the most complicated techniques.  The excellent illustrations and explainations on the right and wrong way to stitch really helped me to see what I was doing wrong and how to stitch the right way.

Whenever I come to a stitch I haven't done before, this is the first book I pull out! <br /> <br />Now, lets talk about the projects and pictures.  There's a color photo for each project in the middle of the book and a black & white photo with each project.  The charts range from beginner to advanced level, and trust me, you'll want to stitch each one.  The fibers and fabrics called for are pretty easy to acquire either from your local store or the internet; and if you need to substitute something, you can do so with ease. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this book highly enough!!  And if you have any questions about the designs or techniques, you can reach the author via e-mail and she's friendly and very happy to help.

For one thing, the writing style is clean, even old-fashionably elegant, and Trench's scholarly approach to using previously published material on the subject is beyond reproach, being thorough and levelheaded throughout.  <br /> <br />That said, just what is the book about? Trench takes on the daunting task of establishing the reality of both the Lost Continent of Atlantis AND the existence of a world hidden in the hollow core of the earth, exactly as the title implies. After patiently making his case for the historical, real world existence of the two legendary locations, he moves on in a third section to discuss the kind of being he speculates may live in the \\"bowels of the earth.\\" <br /> <br />Trench primarily contends that Atlantis did indeed exist some 9000 years before Plato made reference to it in ancient Greece. When the super-advanced residents of Atlantis saw disaster coming, the exact nature of which of course remains unknown, they began to dig tunnels beneath the earth and to migrate east and west in hopes of escaping. While they were for the most part wiped out, the tunnels and some of their machinery remained behind and were used by the survivors to create a habitable world inside the earth, lit by an internal sun while being topographically the opposite of the surface world. For instance, what would be mountains topside are stalagmites hanging from the ceiling instead for those who dwell below.  <br /> <br />Along the way, Trench offers up a wealth of factual data to support his claims. One learns about the cover-up alleged to have been perpetrated by the government regarding Admiral Richard E. Byrd, who very likely discovered a warm, hospitable stretch of land in the Arctic North, as well as an entrance to a world inside the earth that has since been shrouded in official secrecy. The book includes a series of photographs of a large dark hole where the North Pole should logically be seen, taken during a series of NASA satellite over-flights in the late 1960s. This reviewer must admit that the photos look pretty darn convincing. Is the hole the entrance to that fabled subterranean world? This inner world may also be the home base of the countless UFOs that have been sighted repeatedly throughout human history, according to Trench.  <br /> <br />Trench also calls on the late, great Raymond Palmer to shore up his arguments for the existence of an official government \\"clamp-down\\" on information about the secret entrance to the inner earth, as well as the work of Richard Shaver, who claimed to be in contact with two races of people who lived in the hidden world. One of those races, the Dero, formerly occupied the surface of the earth until upheaval and calamitiy forced them to move underground to survive. They have since degenerated into a state of madness and sadism and use their superior technology--machines that are a remnant of the Atlantean scientific know-how--to torture and confuse us surface dwellers, even to the point of causing warfare and genocide among us. As an explanation for the wickedness of human history, this one is as good as any.  <br /> <br />Brinsley Le Poer Trench was also the Earl of Clancarty and a distinguished member of the House of Lords. Until his death at the age of 83 in 1995, he campaigned tirelessly to get the British Crown to open its files on the UFO phenomenon, and would regularly schedule lectures by UFO experts from around the world held there in the Parliament building in London. Trench continues to be sorely missed by all who knew him, and this Global Communications reissue of \\"Finding Lost Atlantis Inside The Hollow Earth\\" is a worthy part of his lasting legacy.	2005-10-13

It did not at all feel like a culminating book of a trilogy; instead, it seemed to meander forward, from chapter to chapter.  I have rarely before in the Darkover series felt a book that was not well plotted and developed.  There was little driving force through the book, and by around 1/3 of the way through, I began to really feel like I was just slogging to the end. <br />While the second book in the trilogy focused largely on Varzil and Carolin, the two major actors of the time period in question, this book focuses on two other characters.  Their stories had a \\"and then this happened....and then that happened....etc\\" feel.  Secondary character development was also lacking. <br />Overall, this felt like too much treading water as the pages went by, followed by an unexpected (and unconvincing, given the 400 pages that had gone before) resolution.	2005-10-13

He shares his joys and tragedies in working with those caught in substance abuse.  This book is not only for those who suffer from addiction, but also for the friends and family of that person who wish to truly help the addict become a disciple of Christ. It is a book that is easy to read with small chapters that include some key questions and statements that many can relate to.  This book also sends hope to the reader and helps them find Jesus in them.  Excellent Book!!!!	2005-10-13

Garcia's prose voice is also singular and entertaining, like Twain crossed with Gabby Hayes. And for lovers of tragedy you will not find tragedy more heartbreakingly rendered in any novel you are ever likely to read.  Notice the other reviews where readers say they want to buy more copies to give to friends, and those who said that they didn't want the story to end. I can vouch for these sentiments as they were my first impressions upon finishing this gritty and moving story.  <br /> <br />IMPORTANT NOTE: The newer version of this book (which includes \\"1878-1879\\" in its title) for some reason does not include photos included in the original paperback version. These photos include shots of Garcia, his wives and love interests, and his territory, and they are valuable to the reader if for no other reason than they depict the beautiful dress of the women in the tribes Garcia encountered.	2005-10-13

The following five chapters are dedicated to a specific movement of the work. \\"Mythologiques\\" is mainly concerned with the source text for the first movement, drawn from Levi-Strauss. \\"O King\\" details the structural properties of the pitch set and the rhythmic set, and the selective resonance of the second movement. For the discussion of the third movement, readers will want to obtain a copy of the score of Berio's work, as Osmond-Smith catalogues the numerous quotations according to the rehersal number they are found in. Osmond-Smith explains the \\"obliteration as form\\" that makes the use of the Mahler quotation so idiosyncratic. The fourth chapter treats the fourth and fifth movements together. Discussion of the fourth movement is very brief, only two pages, but the fifth is exhaustively covered.<br /><br />When I first got a copy of \\"Sinfonia\\", I could relate easily only the zany third movement, which is quite accessible. Osmond-Smith's guide helped me better understand the other movements of the work. The book does indeed expand appreciation of Berio's composition.	2005-10-13

Finally! Bravo! This is what all biographies of underworld figures should be, and almost never are. Indeed, it's what all biographies should be. It will be the benchmark against which all subsequent books about organized crime figures are to be judged. Reading this book, I was in awe of Ms. Keefe's ability to journey back through the mists of time, and hack her way through the hoary legends, and urban myths, the lies and distortions and half-truths that infest far too many books like this, and succeed in transforming O'Banion from the merry, bloodthirsty stereotype he's been for so long into an actual flesh-and-blood human being. Thanks to the journalistic alchemy of Ms. Keefe, O'Banion comes alive in these pages in a way that he never has in any of the other books I've read on this topic. I'm astonished at the amount of new, illuminating information she's been able to unearth in her research. Am I gushing? I guess it's just that I've read so many flawed, poorly-researched underworld fantasies that masquerade as history or biography that coming across Ms. Keefe's work reminds me of why I started reading books like this in the first place. Her writing is as vibrant and exciting as the era she writes about. I'm currently reading her biography of Bugs Moran and can't wait for the next one. I hope she continues researching and writing for a long, long time to come...To sum it up, Ms. Keefe's books are an historical goldmine, and a thrilling read to boot. Buy 'em.	2005-10-13

In order for men to fight a 10 year war there must have been something more to Helen than meets the eye. A companion television production played on PBS recently and was excellent. Definately a good book for anyone interested in pursuing the real Helen in her own time.	2005-10-13

When one looks over the vast array of American Literature, there are but a few books that are ranked in a class by themselves.  They include such novels as \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\", \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", and \\"The Jungle\\".  In any \\"greatest list\\" I've seen, \\"Moby Dick\\" always shows up.  In fact, only Huckleberry Finn draws more support as the Great American Novel.  With this in mind, I decided that it was high time I read \\"Moby Dick\\".  In doing so, I was prepared to appreciate a classic with my only misgivings being my tendency to get bogged down in the tedium of the 19th Century style of prose.   <br /> <br />I admit that I was fairly satisfied with the first part of the novel and I was proceeding along fine until Ismael turned into the world's greatest authority on the subject of whales and whaling.  I may have missed a point or two but I was sure that Ismael's self-introduction identified him as a merchant marine who was embarking on on his first whaling voyage.  He must have been doing a lot of reading on the voyage because he proceeded to tell me more that I ever wanted to know about whales and whaling. <br /> <br />I read \\"Moby Dick\\" to enjoy a story; not to engorge myself with, for me, uninteresting trivia.  The facts overwhelmed the story and I was losing interest fast.  I finally started to speed read my way through the final 50 pages and all of the accompanying \\"Billy Budd\\".  I have seldom been so happy to finish a book and I even entertained the thought of just chucking the book and not even finishing it.  I realize that there are many thousands of people out there for whom the sea is an enchantress.  I also understand that Captain Ahab's maniacal search for the great white whale has allegoties about ourselves (although I wasn't all that motivated to dwell on that subject). <br /> <br />\\"Moby Dick\\" is not the first classic to fall short in my estimation and I'm sure it won't be the last.  I mentioned above that I don't care for 19th Century Literature in general (Henry James \\"The Turn of the Screw\\" put me to sleep).  However, Mark Twain is my favorite author and he seemed to be able to communicate his stories in an enjoyable yet profound way.  Oh well,  to each his own.   <br />	2005-10-13

Yockey's big opus \\"Imperium,\\" emulating Spengler and other such writers, was a know-all interpretation of all of history past, present, and especially future.  All very deep.  Yockey's other contribution was his admiring interpretation of Soviet Communism, but only after Yockey judged it to have sufficiently turned against the Jews.  This analysis, again, very sophisticated, very deep. <br /> <br />Yockey also had a knack of quarreling with just about everyone he knew, especially with those who shared his views.  When a fellow Nazi thought that he might not have purely Aryan background, Yockey shot back:  \\"My height is that of Adolf Hitler, my complexion is white ... you will give me satisfaction [at a duel] ... I shall flog you before witnesses. \\"   <br /> <br />Who would care about a nasty crackpot like that ?  Who would spend time researching all the nooks and crannies of that kind of life  ?  Well, Coogan did, and he deserves our thanks, at least moderately so. <br /> <br />Yockey's life could indeed have been a very significant subject if it had been used as an example in a wider study of the Nazi fringe in America.  Coogan gives us precious little of that kind of material. He does tell us something, for example, about the Nazi propagandist Willis Carto.  But Carto's interesting recent  history -- quarrels with other neo-Nazis, etc. -- are not covered.  Coogan is too focused on Yockey to ever tell us much about related persons and grouplets.  A broader focus would have made this book much more valuable. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I am glad that Coogan did all this digging.  At least now we have the goods on one American Nazi, if not the whole phenomenon.	2005-10-13

Finally, we learn that \\"psychopath\\"  is \\"sociopath\\" now, among professionals.   And I liked that he reminds us that  the \\"perfect\\" person,  marriage, family, the \\"perfect\\" anything is  a fiction.  When someone is held out to be \\"perfect,\\" especially by their family, it can be horribly debilitating, to say the least.  It was also chilling to realize that there are emotional \\"vampires,\\" feeding off others' life blood so they can mimic being human.  Still - I've always had more faith in nature than nurture.  I believe Peterson was born with a predilection to be a sociopath...and to kill.   I've known and counseled people with far worse lives than Scott Peterson's - and they've gotten help and gone on to be good and caring.  The abused, the neglected, the \\"unloved,\\" who should be among the walking dead, but who've refused to let their pasts keep them from  finding and giving love - many have made life work for them wonderfully despite extreme deprivation. Some don't make it, I realize that.  I suppose Peterson is one of them.  But still - murder is the greatest taboo. You have to be pretty \\"bent\\" from the get-go to do it.	2005-10-13

The story alternates between George's view and Thad's view throughout their struggle to destroy each other. <br /> <br />This book, for me at least, was for the most part not too difficult a read. Stephen King has great diction. Some of the words he uses to describe things are extremely effective. These words give the book that extra edge in creating a suspenseful (and often times gruesome) situation. The novel is also one that you don't want to put down. In fact, in the prologue starts you with a little taste of what is to come in the rest of the book. In those first 10 pages you just know that you have to find out what it has to do with the story. You must be warned though, this book is not for those who are faint of heart or have a weak stomach, it's quite graphic. Another interesting thing King does is he splits up the book not only into chapters but also what could be considered two \\"acts.\\" Before and after each act are parts from the stories that the characters in the book have written. This really gives you a good sense of the contrast between the characters and how each of their minds work. Also, once you get a little ways into the book you are now working with two points of view, that of Thad and that of George. This again gives you a great sense of what is going on. Once the two characters are both introduced into the book they are far apart. As the story progresses they gradually come together and their stories meet. Stephen King has an impeccable ability to keep you interested in what will happen next, even in the down time when nothing thrilling is happening.	2005-10-13

Along the way, Adam, who has strong opinions about the \\"future Mrs. Black,\\" reaffirms his own faith. Unwilling to waste his time or her own, Eva fights the attraction they share informing him of her vow of celibacy, hoping that he'll run the other way. But she underestimates Adam's strength. See, Adam's fought much bigger battles than the one she's waging against his love. And as he gathers all his strength once again to fight the enemy he thought he beat-cancer, Eva faces a mother's worst nightmare. Will they overcome their trials and find their way back to each other? Stay turned - and read the book to find out. You won't regret it.  <br /> <br />No other writer has really given us such a revealing look into an interracial relationship like this one. RUIZ, in this determinedly real and spiritual first novel, offers canny insights into a multicultural world. Soulful and poetic, CHOOSE ME is a more than a romance; it is a story about real love.  <br />	2005-10-13

I'm not talking the whole state of Kansas either, but just Topeka.  Last time I checked, Topeka was not the whole world.  Just to make sure, I hopped on a plane to China, and yes, China is not in Kansas, much less Topeka. <br /> <br />Now Mr. Friedman is an obviously intelligent guy, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt and set out on my sailboat to the edge of the world.  Unlike the nautical maps of old, current maps do not have, at their borders, the inscription, \\"Here there be monsters.\\"  Nonetheless, I sailed out to the edge of the map I had and very nearly sailed off the edge of the world.  Friedman was right!  The water just stops at the edge of the earth!  The horizon past the edge was a soul-sucking blackness that chilled my spine.  I screwed up my nerve and peered over the edge into a bottomless abyss of more blackness.  Right then I vowed never to doubt Mr. Friedman ever again. <br /> <br />I have had time to ponder the import of Mr. Friedman's message and its implication for our place in the Universe, but every time I think upon it, the memory of that yawning blackness at the edge of our world threatens to swallow up my limited consciousness and I can proceed no further.  My days of intrepid exploration are at end, and I leave it to others, such as Mr. Friedman, to continue togo where others dare not.	2005-10-13

With the help of Miss Pennington, her devoted mentor and tutor, Charlotte Simmons' is miraculously able to develop her scholarly gift and graduate from her small western North Carolina high school as class valedictorian.  In most cases, graduating as valedictorian from a high school in a town reminiscent of one depicted in, say, 'Deliverance' would not necessarily be an impressive achievement, but pretty and demure Charlotte Simmons is very intelligent.  Unfortunately, Charlotte's intelligence quotient is surpassed by her naivete quotient.<br /><br />When Charlotte arrives at Dupont University, a fictional northeastern campus which is sort a cross between Princeton and Stanford, she finds something other than what she had expected.  Instead of discovering the free flow of scholarship among the nation's elite young minds, she need look no further than her roommate, Beverly, to find the typical Dupont student who is mostly a spoiled, wealthy brat - more concerned with drinking and sex than with academics.<br /><br />Self-conscious about her modest means and extremely sheltered upbringing, Charlotte is overwhelmed by Dupont University and its students.  Beverly introduces Charlotte to terms like \\"sexiled,\\" which in contemporary undergraduate vernacular refers to one's roommate asking (requiring) his or her roommate to sleep elsewhere because of imminent sex with a \\"pick-up\\" from a party.  Charlotte is horrified.  In spite of her inexperience, however, simple and cute little Charlotte still manages to catch the eyes of Jojo, Dupont's star basketball player, Hoyt, the most popular guy in the St. Ray's Fraternity, and Adam, a socially awkward but very clever student who works on the school's newspaper staff.  It is the resolution of Charlotte's relationships with the three that conveys the reader through the `I Am Charlotte Simmons.'<br /><br />Tom Wolfe must have had a lot of fun researching `I Am Charlotte Simmons\\" because the descriptions of the current college experience are so vivid.  Charlotte herself, however, is somewhat overdone as the sweet, innocent country girl.  She is portrayed almost Dickensian at times, and therefore is not really credible.  How can ANYONE be so immature and ignorant in the information age?  Well, apparently Charlotte Simmons can be.  As such, it is difficult for the reader to be sympathetic toward Charlotte when things don't go quite right for her.<br /><br />In spite of the shortcomings of the title character, the subplots of Charlotte's relationships including Jojo's battle to retain his starting spot on a defending national championship basketball team, Hoyt's run-in with the governor of California, and Adam's crises of conscience that involve both Jojo and Hoyt are fun and interesting.  However, the reader may sense that Wolfe had gotten pressure from his publisher to produce a finished manuscript, because the resolutions of the subplots as well as Charlotte's trial are abruptly deus ex machina-ed.  The reader is left just a little flat.<br /><br />Sorry, Tom.  I have to give the effort no more than a C+.  In the era of grade inflation, it's not even as good as it appears.otte herself, however, is somewhat overdone as the sweet, innocent country girl.

But I think it would be exceedingly difficult to find a more thorough, better researched, more comprehensive, and better written automobile history, regardless of topic or marque. One may argue that there are more \\"important\\" cars (or not); perhaps the story of Daimler and Maybach's pioneering efforts, or Henry Ford's, are more \\"important\\" in a larger historical context than the activities of a relatively small maker of specialist sports and racing cars, but that's not what I claim here. I claim that this is the best WRITTEN, most thorough autombile history ever. Porsche, as an automobile and an enterprise, is a very special phenomenon, and Ludvigsen's book presents both company and car to an audience that may otherwise never appreciate it. If you don't like Porsches, then that doesn't matter. If you do, you need this book. If you're not sure, then this book may be the beginning of a lifelong passion for all things Porsche.  <br /> <br />That's how it was with me. I bought myself the much slimmer (but still hefty, at 860 pages) first edition of this book as a Christmas present in 1977. It was instrumental in changing my career path; it affected my choices in university engineering courses, and of a master's thesis. Eventually, six years later, I found myself working as an engineer at Porsche. Incidental to my regular engineering duties, I was often called upon to help some of the leading engineers in the company -- men whose stories I had once read about in Ludvigsen -- write English-language presentations and technical papers. This led to my career expanding to include automotive journalism, engineering writing and technical translation, but the passion for Porsche remains. I have three vintage 356s in the garage, and it was Ludvigsen's book that made me appreciate the virtues of these rolling historical documents. <br /> <br />Karl Ludvigsen is one of the few truly outstanding automotive writers of our time. I can think of only a handful of others who can compare in depth of knowledge and facility with the language (or several languages, in Ludvigsen's case) -- Paul Frere (also eminently multilingual, and a multilingual engineer) and LJK Setright come to mind. Being a bilingual engineer myself, I appreciate even more than most the job that Ludvigsen did in researching this book; his translations into English of many concepts and expressions from company-internal documents are faultless, and definitive. The subjects covered in Ludvigsen's other books include Mercedes, Ferrari, Jaguar, V12 engines, early history of Volkswagen, Indianapolis racers, and Can-Am -- all of which were done in the same outstanding manner. I mention this only because there is one overwhelmingly negative review for this book, posted by somebody who is very poorly informed indeed. That reviewer says \\"Mr. Ludvigsen glosses over the problems with the 356 and early 911 road cars...\\" Not true. When I went to work for Porsche, I found that I already had an excellent working knowledge of foibles and problems encountered with earlier Porsche cars, thanks to Ludvigsen's book. The reviewer also says \\"Mr. Ludvigsen glosses...the internal power struggles within the company and board, and so on.\\" Again not true. The Porsche-Piech, and other, battles are well documented. And the reviewer says \\"If I'd realized Mr. Ludvigsen had a past history of writing for Automotive Quarterly, I would never have wasted this much money buying this set. Just like Automotive Quarterly (which never had a bad thing to say about any automobile).\\" As for \\"never had a bad thing to say about any automobile,\\" I am an author who has also written for Automobile Quarterly, and I have to wonder if perhaps there is another publication of that name, because that's not the AQ that I know. I know this firsthand because among other things, I wrote what I think is a brutally honest history of the Chevrolet Cosworth Vega (AQ, 1989, Vol. 27 No. 3). Incidentally, the first, 1977 edition of \\"Excellence was Expected\\" was published by AQ.  <br /> <br />Bottom line, Ludvigsen's \\"Porsche: Excellence was Expected\\" belongs in the automotive library of anyone who seeks the definitive history of the Porsche marque, the company, and a chronicle of more than a half century of sports car racing history as seen from the perspective of its most successful practitioners.	2005-10-13

Wrong. This book shows its origins as a doctoral dissertation, it is basically a compilation of atrocity reports from a couple of German security units. There is no analysis, not really much argument at all. Simply repeating that the Nazis were ruthless, sometimes using that word six times on one page, is not an argument. Nor is it news.

In each instance his dog Lilac is with him.  (We had no idea he had a dog.)<br /><br />An example of the kinds of things you will see: Harold, Lilac and the fast boat.  Harold is steering, while Lilac is being pulled behind as she water skies.  With the circus scene, Harold is holding onto a bone (on a unicycle) while Lilac leaps through a hoop.  Harold is in clown makeup.<br /><br />At this time there's no 'search inside' feature with this book so I'll give you an example of the text from the last 4 pages.<br /><br />\\"Harold and Lilac are tired and need to get back home.<br />This *taxi cab* will do the trick.<br />Harold is sleepy.  It is time for bed.<br />Tomorrow is sure to bring new adventures.\\"<br /><br />Because of the going to sleep part of the story, this might make a nice bed-time book.  Otherwise, the images of a boy and his dog at the circus or in other interesting places ought to entertain a small child.<br /><br />Three to Four Stars.  An okay book, it will likely not satisfy real Harold & Crayon fans, but babies probably won't care and will like the pictures of things that go.  As for age range, I think that this book is probably better for babies and toddlers.  Preschoolers will most likely prefer the original Harold and the Purple Crayon books with their 'drawing' fun.	2005-10-13

Wow, this could've been so much better then what was given to me. Since my, A Nightmare on Elm Street 1 review might've been all around and hard to follow, let me break down this review.<br /><br />First off folks, the storyline. Young, punk-rock, get the hell out of my face Jess Golden has a premonition of the building she's playing in collapsing. Oh my God, what does she do? Why, my friends, she gets her ass out of there of course. But those who follow her, including the terribly annoying, preppy Eric (I'll get to this guy later) and her somewhat boyfriend Jamie, are thankfully saved from the inevitable death that awaits them (big words)! Then they all seem to die off rather slowly, and I wasn't that much interested.<br /><br />In the creativity department, I guess you can say Rhodes tried her best. Again, it felt kind of repetitive in some points in the book. I rarely felt scared or gloomy like I did in the dark Suffer the Children novel. It seemed too funny to be scary. I never once really, deeply cared about the characters. And by the end of the novel (and only at the end for some reason), the word `cos' was used more than the number of games the Chicago White Sox have won (and they've won a lot for all those who didn't already know). Ugh, what can I say, I only spent $8 on it...<br /><br />In the fear and gore department....cricket noises please. I was rarely scared, and the gore was kept to a minimum. There's not much I can say without spoiling the plot.<br /><br />And finally, in the Eric department. My god, he is an annoying son of a bitch. If he were a true person, I would have killed him myself, not saying that he dies or anything...or does he? I can't spoil this book for you, even if I did somewhat dislike it.<br /><br />Overall, it's an okay read with okay characters and okay ideas. Still, Dead Reckoning could've been so much better. Oh well, maybe Destination Zero (which seems to have helicopters in it, based on the preview in the end of the book) will be more exciting and better.<br /><br />I give it 2 annoying Erics out of 5<br /><br />Rated PG-13: language and violencew in the end of the book) will be more exciting and better. <br /> <br />I give it 2 annoying Erics out of 5 <br /> <br />Rated PG-13: language and violence <br />	2005-10-13

This is an absolutely fascinating book that I read over the course of about 2 days while flying to Europe last summer.  I've always found Mormonism to be a scary and bizarre religion, founded by a man as an excuse to marry as many women as possible.  This book pretty much confirmed this belief.  The Mormons still refuse to face the brutal beginnings of their religion and I doubt any who wrote reviews here actually read the book, they were probably told to come here and denigrate the book by their local sect.  The Mormons would still be practicing polygamy today if it weren't for their greater desire to have their own state.  Lest you think I'm uninformed, I work in a community with a large LDS following and much of what Krakauer writes is similar to what I've witnessed.  I have a good friend at work who was forbidden to attend his own son's wedding because he \\"converted\\" to marry a Mormon girl.  I can still see the pain in his eyes to this day when he talks about not being able to see his only son get married.  Not a very warm and friendly religion, to be sure.	2005-10-13

It interested me. A lot of the other titles they've released lately have been the sort of material you pick and choose; sometimes avoiding large sections of altogether, like the race books they released earlier this year. So I guess I'm rating in comparison to other DnD books.  <br />It's not the most amazing or ground-breaking stuff, but it's a different take on the game than most of us choose to use. I guess it was inspiring to me. I've been DMing now for about 20 years, and though I've done a lot of what's in this book on my own at times, I really enjoyed reading it, and I think this book needed to be produced for those who want to run a battle based campaign and didn't know where to start.  <br />A warning, though. If you're looking for feats, races, classes, prestige classes, etc.... this is not that type of book. That being said, I'm glad. Most other DnD books of late have been only those things with a little fluff to make it all part of a theme. This book is good for any DM.	2005-10-13

One thing about this author: he can be amusing, wicked, and pedagogic at the same time, and he spouts forth words almost like a non-extinct volcano. How does he do it?! Here he mildly critiques such academic, rambling authors like Iris Murdoch, while writing in awe of the legendary literary busyness of John Updike. His appreciation of Bellow for his non stop exuberance, and Nabokov for his extreme wordplay may be overdone, but nonetheless well worth the read. The best pieces may be of Anthony Burgess, the rollicking, phantasmagorical Brit, especially his review of the Burgess autobiography. He admits Joyce's ULYSSES is not a \\"straight thru\\" read, a comment which perfectly matches my thoughts, but plows thru this hefty tome with great style and aplomb! In fact, the fun and amusement prac tically never cease here, as in most of Mr. Amis's now hefy oeuvre. So reading through this book bit by bit is an enjoyable romp, a fun and stimulating way to make it through the night!	2005-10-13

The stain is so stubborn that no amount of scrubbing will remove it. When all her attempts fail, Birdie does the unthinkable: she loads her Swifter Wet Jet with every cleaning fluid she has. Now we all know what happens when you mix cleaning fluids. Poof! Toxic cloud. And a superhero is born!    After the cleaning incident, Birdie, aka Super Mom, awakens to find herself endowed with some very handy powers including fingers that shoot super cleaning fluid and a hand that doubles as a swifter. As she struggles to harness her super powers, Birdie faces a litany of unexpected challenges, like designing a superhero costume (heels or flats?), finding a trusty sidekick, and figuring out if she can fly.    Birdie must somehow balance two teenagers, her smug ex, his overachieving new wife, a string of PTA meetings, and making it to work on time as the mild-mannered cashier at the Marvel Fine Food and Beverages (all superheroes have a day job) --- all while controlling her chemically-induced superpowers, keeping her alter-identity a secret, and protecting Astro Park, a city whose very existence is threatened by a mysterious force sneaking its way into every household.    From the book's very first page you find yourself grinning. Every mom can relate to the daily challenges of multitasking and navigating kids and household chores. The everyday adventures of the laundry, dishes, kids' carpool and PTA are punctuated with the town's needs for Super Mom. From catching local teenagers necking at the high school harvest ball, to kids who won't brush their teeth or wear their seat belts, Super Mom saves them all. But wait...she must also figure out how to fight the evil axis of power that is trying to take control of the town and its inhabitants.    CONFESSIONS OF A SUPER MOM provides an amusing read asyou follow Birdie's adventures. Never has there been a more loveable, down-to-earth superhero, with more enviable and practical superpowers. Did I mention she can also read her teenagers' minds? I'm sure we can all think of a time that that would have come in handy!    Melanie Lynne Hauser's quirky characters sparkle like just-polished silver, and her writing shines like a streak-free window. Indeed, CONFESSIONS OF A SUPER MOM is a much-needed vacation for overwhelmed mothers everywhere.    So forget the laundry and the dishes, and let yourself escape into the world of Super Mom for a few hours. It's a fresh, upbeat look at what it takes to be a mother. With wit, humor and some age-old motherly advice, this book gives the reader a true-to-life hero, helping every mom find the Super Mom inside!    [...]	2005-10-13

The author, a psychiatrist, has observed manic behavior in today's society, comparable to the manic behavior observed in his patients. The driving force of this mania is today's fast paced economic engine. There is much to be learned here, as the topics cover a wide range of subjects from economics to brain chemistry.     The book is a well written, especially the beginning chapter, which is a brilliant expose of the author's theory on American society. By the end of the journey, I suppose the lesson is pretty simple: People need to slow down and take time for each other. There is also another important lesson, concerning the negative impact that large American mega corporations have on local community economics and foreign cultures.     My one complaint is minor, regarding the ending of the book and \\"The Rules of T.O.M.\\". Tom is a real person and an American Manic. He is a former Olympic level athlete, an Ivy League graduate, and a deal maker always living on the edge. By the end of the book, Tom has changed his ways, now putting his energies into curing people of their manic ways. These anecdotal rules are not the type of ending that I was hoping for. I felt that this was like a plot contrivance to \\"wrap things up\\", and it came across as a bit too neat. Had Tom truly experienced an epiphany of sorts? Had Tom \\"gone to Hell and back\\" and truly reformed his manic ways? Or is Tom someone who saw an opportunity to make money curing this newly identified American social illness?     Dr. Whybrow's thoughts concerning the need for human empathy are profound. He writes that empathetic skills are learned behavior, and it is a parent's responsibility to foster a child's development of empathetic behavior. This is becoming increasingly more difficult as the media promotes self-centered behavior. I've also read similar books of this genre, such as \\"The Closing of the American Mind\\", that reinforce many of these same ideas.	2005-10-13

Dr. Hanson has taken this well studied war and approached it from a a very interesting perspective. Rather than the standard chronologic retelling (done recently and well by Donald Kagan), Hanson delves into the facets of the conflict such as ships, seiges, horses etc. to craft a readable and stimulating exegesis of the twenty-seven year bloodbath. I say readable because his writing is fluid and almost conversational. You almost feel as though your in a lecture hall. My only criticism (which doesn't cost the book a star) refers to the quality of the maps ...they don't seem to add very much to the text other than simply showing where the various cities or islands are located. Personally, I prefer the tactical maps and would have liked to see more of them, especially for episode such as Mantinea , Delium, and the late naval battles. That aside, this was a wonderful experience. I hope Dr. Hanson will someday do the same for the Punic or other Roman wars.	2005-10-13

It took over the headlines in the late 80s with a horrifying tale of racism and abuse, with accusations against influential and senior law enforcement officials.  In the end, it turned out that Tawana had lied about everything-- but the damage was done.  This fascinating step by step account by the reporters who did the work to get to the bottom of the tangled story Tawana spun is still riveting today-- and the exploitation of her symbolic value by Black leaders (especially Al Sharpton) and the press is reminiscent of subsequent cases (OJ's, for example) that dominated months of news coverage.

You read war books and there are always characters that aren't afraid to die, and are unemotional. All of these \\"heroes\\" get lost in the endless list of different characters commiting the same acts. But this book is different. Perry is a person from Harlem, and you can relate to him. He does get scared when he goes into battle, and he doest not take comfort in killing. It is refreshing to read this because it has a way of comforting us. I know that i am not the only one that has thought about how i would act if i ever went to war. Society puts a pressure on you to be some sort of hero, but this book kindly reminds you that it is the normal soldiers that are hero's.  <br />  The other thing i like about this book is the message that it sends to me as a reader. It has a strong sense of brotherhood and puts an emphasis on the comforts of home. Throughout the book the men are counting down the days until they leave Vietnam. Not only do the soldiers care about when they leave, they care about when others leave. When Perry's commandor is only weeks away from leaving, the platoon comes together to protect him so that he can go home. THe book also puts an empahsis on the comforts of home. There are flashbacks frequently in the book showing the things that each soldier missed about homes, things that we often take for granted. <br />The book is a great read and i recomend it to anyone that loves a good book.	2005-10-13

The title is a little bit of a misnomer.  One gets the idea you will be reading a story of conspiracy against the German dictator by German army officers.  What one gets is the story of German army officers misleading Hitler and letting the Allies win at the Normandy invasion.  Even this is not really proved.  The author footnotes many authors that have proven false themselves.  An author he quotes even wrote a book about Hitler purporting him to be alive in South America.  Johnson gives a lot of attention to Canaris, as the master of this conspiracy.  Most don't know what this shadowy figure gave in the resistance movement.  There are a lot of theories but very little actual proof.  This book is unfounded in many things on the Normandy invasion.<br /><br />This book gives a lot of trivial facts about the Normandy invasion, but little in the way of proof of what the author alleged happened.  Not a difficult book, but the reader must understand that what is written is not always true.	2005-10-13

Fianc&eacute;e Holly Canton, daughter of the local sheriff of Palmetto County, has asked him to retire from the force. As much as she loves him, she's determined not to lose a second husband in the line of duty. Two years later, after several unsuccessful attempts to take down brutal drug lord, Carlos Santiago, Johnny capitulates and plans to devote the rest of his life to Holly and her thirteen-year-old son, Colin.<br /><br />Life doesn't cooperate, however, when Santiago stages a massacre on Sand Key, targeting Johnny. Holly and Colin are slaughtered in the crossfire. Johnny and his loyal police dog, Rex, are gravely wounded.<br /><br />Enter Enola, the strong, steadfast Seminole nurse who rescues Johnny and Rex from certain death and secrets them off to a tribal village to recuperate. A natural beauty and empathetic spirit, Enola contributes to Johnny's recovery with more than her knowledge of medicine. Armed with cunning tribal methods and the help of the village elder, Johnny struggles to beat the death sentence imposed by Santiago.<br /><br />Meanwhile, something's rotten in the sheriff's office. No one knew about Johnny's trip to Sand Key except the sheriff and his coworkers. Johnny suspects each in turn, until his investigative powers flush out the culprit responsible for leaking the information to Santiago and his band of killers. As he heals emotionally and physically, Johnny plots to take down Santiago's empire. The climax is replete with tension and nail biting action - the perfect and righteous revenge.<br /><br />There is much more to this riveting novel than a clever plot and magnetic characters. The prose is smooth and engaging, the dialogue is natural, and the sense of place is immediate.

In fact it is for a small group of people. I believe that if you find yourself in your late 30's or older and have not set aside money for retirement this book will help kick you in the rear to get going.  But it is not just motivation; it gives you several ways to really get going.   <br /> <br />As with anything you can say this book is better then that one.  But I always think that those people are just pushing their own books or their companies books.   <br /> <br />As I said if you a business major this book is not for you.  If you are someone who has always lived within their means and put money away this book is not for you.  If you are young and believe in saving this book is not for you.  But for those of us who have been focused on other things such as a career and found ourselves without proper savings it gives a good starting point.	2005-10-13

Poldarn has decided that he does not wish to remember his past, as what hints he has gotten are all pretty appalling.  Alas, his past is not so eager to forget about him.

The prose is more polished and the metafores more subtle, but otherwise the content is just more of the same.

US	32893147	R149NG47AKYS1D	0525675418	731538357	The Sin Eater	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Sin Eater	Overall I was very pleased with this book.  Being familiar with the myth of the \\"Sin Eater\\", I was very excited about the topic of what I thought the book would present.  After reading about one third of the way through however, I found it slightly odd and frankly disappointing that there had been only a brief sentence or two about a sin eater which appeared within the first chapter of the book.  Not to be swayed, however, the book up to that point was filled with emotion and heartache.  A young boy and his father return to the family farm after his mother's funeral to start a new life with his grandparents.  There is an emptiness that rings through that pages that anyone can take to heart.  Cole, the now motherless boy, narrates the text filled with daydreamed memories and a mournful spirit.   <br /> Cole is not the only the reader routes for throughout the book.  The grandparents are overflowing with a familiarity to my own family that is difficult to overlook.  The language that Schmidt uses in anything from dialogue to description is precise and easy to relate to.  The images that he paints with words almost pop in the head without purposeful thought.   <br /> I did find the plot to move quite slowly for the first 100 pages or so.  Although the background and daily observations were necessary to tie the whole story together, I did find myself aching for action.  Although the title of the book leads one to believe Schmidt will tell a glorified tale of a real and local sin eater, that is not the case.  That may leave some disappointment, but the book adds the myth just enough to flavor the true plot.  The novel also brings in minor plots about making friends, being compassionate and trying to make the best out of heartache and sorrow. <br /> Throughout the novel Cole discovers a story about a sin eater who in fact lived on the very same farm he was living on generations ago.  The tale of the sin eater leads Cole through a search on his own ancestors.  He discoversa generation full of guilt and grudges.  He is able to personalize his own feelings of guilt and pain in the memory and stories of his ancestors.  Just when the reader has felt enough pain on the behalf of Cole, Schmidt adds a suicide of Cole's father that brings the reader to tears.  Schmidt sets the stage and story in such a way that the reader feels the same anger and confusion as Cole.  The reader is left in shock and asking why, although they should have seen it coming.   <br /> Although the story is woven in pain, it gives the reader a boy reveling in his own family history to find a way to release his own guilt and anger.  In the end, Cole uses the story of the sin eater who loosed the guilt of an ancestor and his adopted son to rid Cole of his own guilt and anger toward the loss of his parents.   <br />	2005-10-13

They are book-ended by classically-driven pieces [i.e., the Odyssey] as well as Renaissance works [Dante]. Hirsch brings his own personal experiences to these renowned works and coopts their voices. The middle sections do not work as well, as they  are \\"personal,\\" or adopt the guise of so being; and they somehow do not hang together cleanly. There are some good pieces, however, like the concentration camp art of children, but the very confessional nature of them is not as strong as the less personal beginning and ending poems.	2005-10-13

Finding out about them and their ideas was as much fun as it will be to read Dan Brown's next book about the Masons. Secret knowledge is always fun...forbidden fruit and all.<br /><br />Style does spend a fair amount of time in introspection, rather than simply turning this into a poor version of a 500-page issue of a Penthouse Letters book. This was one of the most refreshing things about the book. Although I disagree with his conclusions, it is nice to see the author actually consider the philosophical implications of his work.<br /><br />In all, I would say that it is a very worthwhile book. I would additionally like to give the author and publisher a pat on the back for style points in presentation. I actually had a goal upon entering the bookstore. A book I was there to purchase. However, I quickly forgot all about it, got engrossed in this, and wandered out with a goofy smile on my face. Six blocks away, I remembered my original goal.<br /><br />Something must have been done right. A very well put together book. I was well-pleased with it. While it isn't for everyone, it is interesting, and a careful read with an open mind will leave you thinking about yourself and your own behavior...a very good sign.

This is the long-awaited second edition of Fletcher & Rossing.  Note first that it really is a reference work, not a teaching text.  There is no lesson plan, no problems, no solutions manual, no accompanying workbook  Except for the first two foundation sections on vibrating systems and sound waves, there is no ongoing development.  Nothing builds.  It's just one topic piled on another.   <br />       But the great merit of reference works is that you can cherry-pick, i.e. seek information on isolated topics with little concern for what preceded them.  As a reference work, F&R get the highest possible marks from me.  They are clearly the masters of this field, not least because of their numerous important contributions to it.  With the possible exception of the works of Arthur Benade, they own the business.   <br />       Despite its enormous size and great depth of coverage, however, it is not an encyclopedic study of musical instruments.  It is exactly what the title says: a work on the PHYSICS of musical instruments.  A rigid boundary has been drawn between physics and every other aspect of music-making.  In particular, psychoacoustics is totally ignored.  There are no entries in the index under loudness, Fletcher-Munson, combination tones, false bass, consonance, dissonance, etc.  Even equal temperament tuning gets little more than one page out of 756. <br />       The Preface says the work is addressed to \\"the reader...who is not frightened by a little mathematics.\\"  Well, some of the math is \\"little\\" but some of it is not.  See for example the use of Green's functions to find the air load on a vibrating membrane, pp. 588-590.  Perhaps at MIT, where incoming freshman are sorted out by the do-or-die killer course in mathematical physics from Morse & Feshbach, these methods are taught to undergrads, but not at most other schools.  Almost everywhere else this would be considered first-year graduate material.  These pages would not only frighten the averagereader; they frighten me.  I always hated Green's functions and considered it part of my mission in life to prune them away wherever they grew. <br />     There are a few typos, mislabeled equations and the like.  The next-to-last sentence of text on p. 232 says, \\"This is an adquate approximation provided the sound wavelength is small compared to the transverse dimensions of the ducts and cavities involved.\\"  Surely \\"small\\" should read \\"large.\\" <br />       In sum, not for beginners, and probably not for most musicians either.  But within its compass it reigns supreme.  There is no better book in this field.     <br />  <br />	2005-10-13

Just like genes use organisms to reproduce and grow, we use superorganisms -societies- to the same end. These superoganisms and their componentes (individuals), among  which there is always a hierarchy -the pecking order of societies- use memes -ideas, concepts, ways of doing things- to justify and achieve favorable changes in the said hierarchy. Bloom uses examples from the animal world (ants, rats, chimps, gorillas and chickens) to show us the superorganism in action, as well as human history's examples to reveal to us human superorganisms in action (Rome, China's Cultural Revolution, the Iranian Islamic Revolution, etc.). He studies the memes par excellence, religion and ideologies, to show the way in which they have been used in the eternal struggle to alter the pecking order in one's favor. Bloom thus shows that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, since each individual is but an expendable cell in the social superorganism. Just as Bruce Thornton does in his book \\"Plagues of the Mind\\", Bloom proves that the Noble Savage is just a myth, and debunks other myths like the idea that females, including women, are by nature more peaceful and harmonious than males. They simply play different roles within every superorganism. In fact, playing different roles has distinct effects in the biological functioning of animals and persons. Those individuals who play a superior role in the social order tend to have better health and better looks than the rest, for example lower arterial pressure. Isolation may prove fatal, just like the lack of use of members tends to atrophy them. Another characteristic of superorganisms, according to Bloom, is that they give themselves myths and identify enemies, in order to create an identity and a social cohesion. We humans have created memes to control other humans. And by the way, memes can produce peace and progress, or backwardness and hatred, and so there are substantial differences in the quality of different cultures, and not the other way around, like multiculturalists sustain. Either totally accurate or not, this book is an eye-opener and an agent provocateur of intelligent debate, and so it is most welcome.  <br /> <br />PS: be aware that Bloom does not deny free will nor presents human beings as just bricks in the wall. He simply takes us to the big picture and shows how it works.	2005-10-13

There are simply too many of them. Christopher Kennedy Lawford distinguished himself by becoming a soap opera star, appearing on \\"All My Children\\" through the 1990s, a happy time for him because he was working steady and staying sober. He has proven himself to be a competent, if somewhat wordy, writer in this fast-moving memoir. <br /> <br />Alcoholism is clearly the curse of the Kennedy clan, and Lawford came by it honestly, from his mother Pat Kennedy, who was unwilling or unable to acknowledge her own ghosts, and his father Peter Lawford, a handsome, hard-working actor, a hard-living Hollywood animal and \\"womanizing spendthrift\\" (as his ex-wife later characterized him). Peter had a suave English accent and \\"bedroom eyes\\" that he passed on to his son, and he used his charms to bed most of the beauties in his circle. It was a circle that included the hottest babes of the day. Peter was a charter member of the infamous Rat Pack and a regular at Hugh Hefner's mansion. At one point in his adolescence, Lawford recalls, \\"My dad was entertaining some mates from England --- John Lennon, Ringo Starr and Mick Jagger. Yeah, this will work.\\" <br /> <br />So Lawford grew up surrounded by the brightest stars that Hollywood was spitting out in the latter half of the 20th century, as well as the kings and king-makers whose power ebbed and flowed through Washington. He was closer than a kid ought to be to the Cuban Missile crisis and the Civil Rights movement. And he was in the bosom of a family torn apart twice by bullets and violent, senseless death. As he puts it, \\"Having a family member killed definitely messes with your sense of safety. What I realize now about my uncles' assassinations is that the massive outpouring of collective grief and goodwill toward the family obscured the underlying realization that there were people in the world who wanted to blow our f---ing heads off.\\" Very likely, too, the public process prevented private grieving, compelling the Kennedys to act more courageous than they felt, and less emotional. <br /> <br />Lawford and many of his cousins reacted by wilding. When you have access to wealth and plenty of pull, the fences are few. The drugs that they indulged in were common for the niche of society they ran with, and testing the limits in the underbelly of commerce, dealing with the dealers, just made the game more exciting. Busts and bail, repeated exercises in forgiveness and failure, were par for the course. When his beloved cousin David died of an overdose, a distant alarm bell went off in Lawford's fogged consciousness. But it took years to pull himself back from the brink. <br /> <br />You can't feel too sorry for a kid who had every chance, every privilege, and who continually blew it, and it's fair to say that Lawford asks for no sympathy. He recounts his own fall into disgrace and ruin with gallows humor. He rejoices in his one great success: becoming sober --- something his father never achieved. However, the book is ridden with self-congratulation thinly disguised as self-criticism. When Lawford left his wife he called himself all sorts of names, but had to add this small bit of back-talk: \\"even if a woman gets everything she wants in a marriage, if a man leaves, past history is rewritten and suddenly it is she who sacrificed her life so he could live his dream.\\" <br /> <br />SYMPTOMS OF WITHDRAWAL unmasks the Kennedy legend only to a limited extent. The author (or the publisher?) takes advantage by, for example, using a cover shot of Lawford as a kid with his famous Uncle Jack rather than with either less-recognizable parent, even as the book claims to mock the iconography of Kennedy Clanship. Lawford is perhaps overly kind to Uncle Ted, whom he calls Le Grande Fromage, and one suspects some patronage issues there. The Kennedy whom Lost Boy Christopher most admired, it seems, was his Uncle Bobby, arguably the best candidate forPresident of his generation. He also speaks highly of Aunt Eunice, allowing us to recall that there were, hidden off-stage, a number of Kennedys whose lives took a different course, who reached out to others (especially the mentally and physically handicapped), acted with discretion, stayed reasonably sober, and sought no limelight. <br /> <br />Many will find this book --- grand in its scope as Lawford marches all over the map of his culture and the events current --- a satisfying read. Others will be left with questions, though these questions are perhaps inappropriate to the medium. All the guy is trying to do, for heaven's sake, is write about himself, and in that he succeeds. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Barbara Bamberger Scott <br />	2005-10-13

I was in the library and grabed a book off the shelf while I was between classes. For the next several days I couldnt put it down, it was one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. Every free moment I had, my nose was in that book. At night I would stay awake until my eyes hurt and I couldnt see straight. Then I'd go get some water, rub my eyes and keep reading until I fell asleep.  <br />After I finished I looked for other books on the same subject and all I could find were the same stories and behaviors we hear from Disney. Robert Feist does a wonderful job describing the darker side of our faerie tales. If you're interested in this dark side, this is an excellent book for you.	2005-10-13

It's simple and direct, containing a reference to waiting -- Owl was waiting. Then Owl follows the star to the manger visiting the participants in the scriptural story in sequence.  Kids certainly know about waiting for Christmas presents to appear.  The book refocusses that feeling of waiting on the Christ child's appearance.  Unfortunately there isn't too much reinforcement of the idea in the story, so the reader/parent must recall the waiting feeling from time to time during the couse of the read aloud in asides to the child (which is very doable).  Pictures are large and dynamic with occasional use of gold for a feeling of importance and coming festivity.  A good companion book for Who is Coming to Our House? by Joseph Slate.	2005-10-13

It is no secret that people judge us not only on our skills and abilities, but also on our image and social skills.    We all know brilliant and hard-working people that reach career plateaus or fail in business because of their lack of image and social skills.  What is surprising is how quickly people judge us.  Seven years after this book was written, Malcolm Gladwell's \\"Blink\\" recently confirmed Ms. Lavington's message that people can and do size you up within seconds.  Unlike Blink, this book shows you what to do about it.  It also describes how to avoid many other image and social pitfalls that arise long after the first impression is made.  I've never seen this information and advice anywhere else.  What I found particularly unique about this book is that it gives you a rare glimpse of Brahmin class behavior and expectations.  If you aspire to reach this class or interact with them, this book is indispensable.  I strongly recommend this book for all serious business people.	2005-10-13

And for 99% of the book, I was not disappointed.  The cast of characters is still compelling, the murders mysterious and gruesome, and the campy, smarter-than-Sherlock exploits of Pendergast are as fun as ever.  But then comes the end.  Since some readers may not have read the book yet, I won't give away the details.  Suffice it to say, the authors seem to lose confidence in their own ability to keep attracting readers for their next book.  So they build the need to come back for more into the plot itself, which is pretty crappy.  After slogging through Brimstone (an even longer book than this) and Dance of Death, I didn't need to be manipulated into buying another book of theirs.  But after the end of this book, I actually won't bother getting another one.  They've lost me. <br /> <br />It's really too bad, because I was poised to give this book at least 4 stars, and maybe 5, if the ending had delivered even modestly on the action of the bulk of the book.  But alas, they went for the Incredible Hulk TV show ending, and the melancholy piano music was echoing in my head as this clunky ending crashed down.  I felt cheated.	2005-10-13

After seeing her on television, I thought it would be a great book to have and be full of helpful information. I found that most of her solutions to problems were addressed with purchasing her products. It was my understanding that there were inexpensive ways, items from your home & items easily purchased from your local drug store  - which could accomplish the same results as the more expensive remedies & name brands. I did not find the suggestions to be any cheaper than what I was purchasing myself beforehand.  There were some solutions she suggested that worked okay, but I found I was trying too many products, spending more money and not getting the good results stated in the book. <br /> <br />Examples: She says to \\"cleanse\\" before doing certain things like exfoliate - she does not address cleansing. <br /> <br />She suggests that \\"exfoliating\\" will help with the removal of blackheads - but doesn't tell how to remove the blackheads from the face safely without bruising or scarring the skin. <br /> <br />After reading the book I came away with only one or two remedies that worked.   <br /> <br />I would not have purchased this book if I had known the above. <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

I will not go into too much detail about the plot of the story, as that is already been done, but will give my own take on this book. <br /> <br />The fact it is written in first person is probably where it stumbles the most. Not in execution, Feintuch is a decent writer (his haughty air and concerted effort not to use the \\"and\\" as a connector as much as possible notwithstanding) and I actually at points, as the mini reviews in the book proclaim, could not put it down. But, when you have a main character as deplorable and as unlikeable as Roddy, and he is the only perspective you ever get in a 575 page book, it's hard to keep interested.  <br /> <br />Feintuch is daring in trying to explore untrod areas, namely breaking from the hero mold of lots of fantasy and actually creating a main character that not only do we despise, but also see in ourselves. As others have said, how he treats others, and how he reacts internally, allows us to be introspective on how we treat people.  <br /> <br />Still, after so many pages of him whining and bitching and being a general jerk that does, literally, make you throw your book across the room, you wonder: where's the payoff? The sad truth: there isn't any. <br /> <br />I will admit to being a little uncomfortable with the homosexual relationship between Rustin and Roddy at first. But I applaud Feintuch for boldly treading lesser worn ground. It's when that relationship, and how person to person interactions throughout the realm in general, turn toward masochism that I get annoyed. People perhaps get beaten in this type of medieval fantasy setting, but it sometimes feels like Feintuch, as author, gets a bit pleasure in its existence, which can make the reader feel quite uncomfortable. \\"This will hurt me far more than it hurts you...\\"  <br /> <br />An example: people go off without permission, they come back and get beaten. People speak out of line, they get beaten. But then, around page 400, as Roddy and co. are to go back into Stryx and it's mentioned, 11-year-old Genard, a poor stableboy turned vassal to Roddy's younger brother, is said to be a bit rambunctious and such. So, Rustin, wooden \\"switch\\" in hand, takes him round back for a little discipline. After this, I just had to put the book down. <br /> <br />So, yes, I did not finish The Still. It was here that I was done, realizing I just didn't care anymore. I'm thinking of picking it up again, after reading that the end of the book is probably the best part of the whole thing. But then again, knowing I won't get a true ending unless I drudge through the sequel, I'll probably just move on. <br /> <br />I read and read and read because, yes, I hated Roddy, and I was hoping for the payoff the book's description seemed to infer. \\"To become a King, he must first become a man...\\" Does that man include beating people senseless that don't deserve to be, treating servants like alley dogs and then shrugging his shoulders in a \\"oops, I'm sorry\\" gesture that seems far more than enough for his devoted followers, including a \\"meaningless churl\\", a brother he often thinks would as soon betray him for the throne, or the mentor/best friend/lover of convenience? One of the few somewhat redeeming characters, Chela, gets dumped by the side of the road when she dares challenge Roddy and his ways. Good one. <br /> <br />Not every story needs to have a happy ending, but good writing about bad people isn't enough, at least not for me. The Still is decent writing about people I'm glad don't actually exist.	2005-10-13

James Blackwood is one of those people who served as a role model by the way he treated others, conducted himself professionally, and pioneered an artform and ministry. Dr. Allen Dennis is to be commended for collecting this tribute. The thing that stood out for me was the character factor, i.e., that several contributors mentioned how Blackwood was a polished professional who took his work seriously, yet he was approachable and truly interested in other people.<br /><br />Like several others said in their comments in the book, James Blackwood was one of my heroes when I was growing up. Professor Dennis edited this book in such a way that the comments pertaining to Blackwood relate to much more than just him. They demonstrate how others can leave a similar legacy in their own arenas. It's a matter of dedication and discipline. Repeatedly, Blackwood is described as a Christian gentleman and a genuine professional at his craft. I suggest the same could be said for Allen Dennis who left this work as part of his legacy.	2005-10-13

While Ruiz's tenents are quite simple and should seem to be common sense (foundation comes from The Four Agreements), he expresses them with appropriate metaphors to offer an alternative and, in my opinion, a healthier conception of love. <br /> <br />We should move away from the idea of Jerry Maguire love -- the \\"you complete me\\" mentality.  Portraying love as a need/desire that must be obtained in order to be a whole person is not healthy; and it perpetuates the notion that single people are unhappy and incomplete.  This book focuses on the value of self-love and exuding that self-love to others. <br /> <br />The inherent difficulty is that when buying into Ruiz's point of view, then you may face a challenge in relationships if your partner views love in a different light.  But what do I know?  I'm still single...and loving it. :)	2005-10-13

Give him Different Seasons	For all those who doubt the fact that Stephen King is one of the all-time great masters at the craft of writing, there is Different Seasons.  If nothing else, the doubters should at least acknowledge King's important contribution to reviving the lost art of the novella.  King has always said he would write, whether he ever sold a single book - and I think that is completely true.  He didn't write these four novellas with publication in mind; each one was written immediately after the completion of a best-selling novel - and each one just sort of sat there after it was finished.  What, after all, can a modern author really do with manuscripts too long to be short stories and too short to be novels?  Eventually, the idea came to King to just publish them together, with a title that speaks to the fact that these are not the author's usual blood-dripping, creepy-crawling horror stories.  In doing so, he not only gave us four of his most captivating works of fiction, he showed a whole new generation of readers the vast, inherent power of the novella.<br /><br />Three of these four novellas are even better-known than many of King's best-selling novels - due in no small part to the movie adaptations that followed in their wake.  It all started with the film Stand By Me - which was not marketed as an adaptation of a Stephen King work of fiction.  This was a smart move, considering some of the weak adaptations of earlier King novels.  I can only guess how many impressed moviegoers were shocked to learn that Stand By Me was adapted from King's novella The Body.  It's a story of four boys who set off to see a dead body, that of another kid hit by a train; their adventure makes for an extraordinary coming-of-age story.  It is, in fact, a story about childhood, founded upon a mysterious event in King's own early days (he supposedly saw a friend hit by a train when he was four years old - but there has always been some question as to whether or not this is true); The Body feels autobiographical, and it truly does recapture the essence of childhood and the maturing process into adolescence.  I like to think of The Body as a fantastic warm-up to King's later novel It, which captures the essence of childhood almost perfectly.<br /><br />Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption gave birth to Shawshank Redemption, the most critically acclaimed and popular of all King movie adaptations.  I think the movie is even better than the novella (largely due to Morgan Freeman), but everything that shines in the movie is here in the novella.  An innocent man, convicted of killing his wife and her lover, gives new meaning to the term patient resolve - and has a profound effect on some of his fellow prisoners.  I think it's the ultimate prison story, as it shows us the good and the bad of prison life and imbues its characters with a humanity rarely seen in prison-based stories.  It's just a stellar piece of writing.<br /><br />Apt Pupil is my favorite, though, and it finally, after years of fits and starts and rumors, was made into a film in 1998.  The movie did make some changes to the original storyline, but it was a vastly underrated film that truly embodied the spirit of King's original novella.  The most horrible things can oftentimes be the most fascinating.  I know I've always been fascinated by everything that took place in the Third Reich.  The teenager in the story, though, is obsessed with those atrocities, and that obsession turns into something increasingly disquieting and dangerous when he discovers a former Nazi living under another name in his neighborhood and blackmails him into telling him all the \\"gooshy\\" details of his part in the Holocaust.  Apt Pupil is one of the most impressive psychological studies of evil I've ever read.<br /><br />The Breathing Method sort of gets lost in the shuffle.  It's shorter than the other novellas and has never been adapted for film.  I really like this story, though.  It has a classic fireside story feelto it, hearkening back to the likes of Poe, with its mysterious gentlemen's \\"club\\" and emphasis on story-telling.  The particular story we are privileged to hear about is in some ways rather ridiculous and certainly quite melodramatic - yet it works extremely well.  The novella was dedicated to Peter and Susan Straub, and I think it shows the obvious influence of horror maestro Straub from top to bottom (which, to my mind, is a good thing).<br /><br />The Breathing Method supplies the theme that serves as a sort of mantra for the entire collection: It is the tale, not he who tells it.  The story is everything, and the author is sort of a literary midwife who helps the birthing process along.  I heartily believe that many a King critic would fawn over Different Seasons if they read it without knowing who wrote it.  This book is a perfect introduction for those yet to experience King for themselves - these are, for the most part, mainstream works of fiction that reveal a master storyteller at work.ory feel to it, hearkening back to the likes of Poe, with its mysterious gentlemen's \\"club\\" and emphasis on story-telling.

The first is \\"Celebration\\", first presented in 2000, and the second is Pinter's first play \\"The Room\\", dating from 1957.<br /><br />The comedy \\"Celebration\\" comes as a bit of a change of pace after the very intense \\"political\\" plays Pinter wrote from 1985 to the turn of the millennium. Riotously funny, it is set in \\"the best restaurant in Europe\\" with the stage divided into two tables. At one, Lambert and his brother Matt dined with their wives, Julie and her sister Prue, celebrating the anniversary of Julie and Lambert. At the second table, Suki chats with his wife Russell. As the play progresses, the characters get progressively more drunk, make appalling revelations without realizing it, divulge their infidelities, and yet stay oddly content and glad-hearted. Among the tables roam Richard and Sonia, the owners, and a hilarious intrusive waiter. It has been a long time since I read a Pinter play that made me laugh out loud (unless it was the laugh of shock and outrage at revelations in his political works), and enjoyed \\"Celebration\\" immensely.<br /><br />\\"The Room\\" was written when Pinter was still squarely in the genre of theatre of the absurd. Rose, a sixty-something housewife, muses about who's living in the basement flat of her building, talks incessantly to her taciturn husband, and encounters a young couple interested in the room to let. At the end of the play Riley, a \\"blind negro\\" enters and brings a surprising message to Rose, resulting in the play's shocking ending. While I found the ending compelling, most of the play is fairly tedious; the very length of the play is a mark of the young writer's immaturity, since mature Pinter is quite compressed. Still, worth checking out as the beginning of a very entertaining career.	2005-10-13
US	50914475	RALKA5CFGYW9E	0765342308	119454509	Briar Rose	Books	3	1	4	N	N	A basic review	Briar Rose is a story of a woman who grew up in Nazi Germany, whose life resembles that of Sleeping Beauty's. Becca, her granddaughter, when she was little, would always ask to hear her grandmother tell the story. When Becca gets older and Gemma, her grandmother, is bout to die, her last words to Becca are the statement, \\"I am Briar Rose.\\" Becca finds a box of her grandmothers with old photographs and newspaper clippings and documents that are clues to Gemma's life. No one really knew where her grandmother was from or even her real name. So Becca sets out on a journey to reveal her Gemma's past. It takes her to Poland where she discovers Gemma was in a concentration camp and almost dies. That's when a man uses mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to bring her back.  <br />  This is where the sleeping beauty story and Gemma's life are parallel. But I think the real story is following Becca while she pieces all the clues together. The story is a quick read written in past present tense, but every other chapter is a flashback when Becca was young and Gemma was telling her tale. It's definitely meant for young adults, but I think it's a very creative way to portray the story of the holocaust to a younger audience. Library Journal says, \\"[It] Showcases Yolen's skill at transforming the real world into a realm of fantasy.\\" If you're looking for a holocaust story, I recommend it. If you're looking for a fairy tale, the title may be a bit misleading. But despite the brutal holocaust facts, the story is heartwarming and inspiring, and may be something you'll enjoy reading anyway.  <br />	2005-10-13

I challenge this so-called hero to come forth and prove his deeds and his involvement in actions of that platoon. He will forever hide behind that facade of \\"lost paper work\\" and the blundering military machine.  His own words were that the very worst type of soldier was one who lied, boasted, or made false claims.  He should've looked in a mirror before saying such things.  I, along with the men of the platoon will never honor any statement made by this man until he tells the truth.  He was a REMF in our book. Before I can 'review' this book I AM REQUIRED to give it at least one star rating by Amazon, in my mind it does not deserve even that lowest rating.

I disagree with some of the other reviews in that I didn't find it penetrating or searing. Bruno Manz stabs but fails at soul-searching.  <br /> <br />In some ways it is repetitive. The author explains again and again how he was brainwashed into Nazism from youth to young adulthood. He digresses into various life experiences with teachers, schools, childhood friends, military experiences and lesser details of life. All of which he thinly connects to his primary purpose for the memoir, exorcising his personal demons over blindly serving Hitler. Many of those digressions would be unremarkable without that connection. Bruno uses those vignettes to underscore that he was misguided but they fail to reveal, illuminate or prove how any particular incident, mentor or authority figure contributed to his blind devotion to Hitler. In fact, he frequently recounts how he internally rebelled against school authorities, military authorities, rules and procedures that didn't make common sense or rubbed him the wrong way. If that is so, then he should have self analyzed further to determine how and why he dismissed his conscience when it called about Hitler, the concentration camps and the Jews. He continued to follow the grand lie and served as essentially a political officer in youth organizations and later in the military. He recounts that he was never very enthusiastic and harbored doubts, yet he continuously pressed on. Example on pg 69, he describes a school director quoting Hitler's credo, \\"He who wants to live, let him fight. And he who does not want to fight in this world of eternal struggle does not deserve to live.\\" Bruno expresses misgivings when the school director says that is more religion than a person would ever find in the Bible. He admits agreeing with the anti-Semitism and anti-Catholicism of the director but boycotts his classes from then on. Methinks he doth protest too much. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, Bruno Manz clearly, genuinely, honestly apologizes for his personal role in Germany's evil shame. He denounces all that he was and embraces all that he has become since the war and particularly while living in America. But in the end about all that Bruno confirms is that, at least between 1915 and 1946, Germans were weak for rhetoric, easily swayed by romantic and heroic figures, and followed the crowd. He doesn't dig deep enough to reveal how that was possible. Were they greedy, mad, angry, vulnerable, ambitious, fearful, bombastic, maniacal, weak, bloodthirsty, gullible? Personally, he was swayed by Dad while impressionable and later by Hitler via Goebbels propaganda machine. OK, we already know that about every German during WWII. Bruno, why and how were you vulnerable to that when the rest of the world was not? Why do some Germans today continue to deny the Holocaust? Why is there an element that still deifies Hitler and anti-Semitism?  <br /> <br />I suspect that Bruno cannot to this day accept his own cowardice. He never dared to disagree or question his father, although he credits his mother and older brother with being able to avoid anti-Semitic hatred and Hitler worship. He wouldn't dare question his Nazism or the Fuhrer because he very likely knew it would mean his death or imprisonment. Hmmm, that may be the self evident truth every German citizen who willingly participated in Nazism has to face. They didn't take any contrary action because it was someone else who was being victimized and they were cowards. So, while he may have achieved some catharsis, I doubt that he completely exorcised the regret and shame he aimed for. Still, the book has some value derived from its basic honesty and first person account. <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

However, there was one exception to this rule; we were not allowed to even consider checking out any of the Scary Stories books. She claimed that these books traumatized her younger niece. Naturally, that kind of ominous warning did nothing but intrigue me at such a young age. I wanted to see what was so bad about these books. And when I finally sat down to read them for the first time, I was more surprised than horrified by the content inside. Maybe they frightened me a little at the time, but it was also a nice feeling. I felt intrigued, like I was peering into a macabre, mysterious, surreal, and ominous world that I never even knew existed. These stories were my fairy tales while growing up. In order to enjoy them fully, you have to let your imagination get carried away by the content inside. If you are hindered by the cynicism that usually comes with adulthood and adolescence, then you will probably hate these stories. You will write them off as being stupid and irrelevant, but they are an important part of human culture and their relevance is still important to this day. And on a side note, the artwork in these books is good. The drawings are very surreal and dreamlike. They are essential to the atmosphere that these books try to evoke.	2005-10-13

I am continually amazed of the power of the OS X Tiger operating system. However I, like many of the day to day users of the system, do not know how to access many of the neat tools available to Mac OS X Tiger users. I attend workshops and attend Apple User's Group meetings and I'm blown away by the knowledge and skills of some of our Apple users. The problem for me is that even though the tips or hacks given are great one does not use them enough to remember them several weeks later.  <br /> <br />Most publications that cover Apple applications have side bar graphics that draw the readers attention to a neat tip. However, what is really needed is a book that gathers these \\"Killer Tips\\" and put them in one resource organized in a manner that allows the reader/user access to the real power of Tiger. That is exactly what Scott Kelby's Mac OS X Tiger Killer Tips does.   <br /> <br />The book is well designed and the layout is pleasing. The tips contained in the book are the type that cause you to smile, nod and say \\"amen\\".  Do you want to know how to zip a file in Tiger, capture a page, keep your private data private? The books contains literally hundreds of truly killer tips and they are explained in a language and style that we all can understand.  Between the table of contents, index and content specific chapters the navigation of Tiger becomes achievable and the powerful secrets of Tiger are revealed. <br /> <br />This is one book that all Tiger users should have in their library.

Also, the fact that grammatical errors exist in the critical reading passages pinpoints a lack of editing on the writer's part. On the brighter side, the explanations provided together with the answers are comprehensive enough except for the sample essays which I found to be overtly simple.

Harvest has a few additions to it that allow it to be the re-release it is, but I'm still partial to the cover of this lovely baby. I'm reviewing Hive and it'll show up on both, so you know you have the right one when you get the picture of the alien with the dog. That said, to begin:<br /><br />All the Aliens Graphic Novels, distributed by Dark Horse, can be insulted if taken out-of-context and looked at on a one-on-one basis. Still, when thrown into a timeline and looked at as pieces telling the saga of a beast that is, in a sense, more terrifying than anything with Earthly comparisons, its a beautiful beast to behold. In stories like Labyrinth, for instance, you see what contact with Aliens can do to the human psyche and just how frail humans really are, and in additions by people like Mike Mignola you see the human side of the equation. In Hive you are thrust into a world where Aliens are understood to a point and where the item that allows them to become \\"Hive Mothers,\\" Royal Jelly, has become THE narcotic of choice. Accordingly, you have a perpetual goldrush with people willing to take a variety of chances just to have something that is worth vast amounts of money and that makes its user feel better than escapism has ever imagined being. Take that and add in see the ways that people try to get to that payload and you have Hive.<br /><br />As far as a creative complex, the art leaves something to be desired and there are slow place sin the story. Still, for some reason, I'm drawn to the notion of the Alien and this book made me alot happier than many of the others. Perhaps its because it not only adds in little scenarios of trying to raid a hive but comments on the Alien itself, trying to add an understanding of what the Alien is. Or maybe I just like watching people die because of their own stupidity when they mess with something beyond their wildest nightmares.<br /><br />If you want to check out the Graphic Novels, start with Earth Hive and start working outward. These have been going on for years and you'll find alot of stuff you like/ dislike, and some of the stories are fringe tales at best. Unlike others here I liked this story, however, and am giving it a four out of five because I liked what it did.

I'd read through River God a few times, and I was eagerly awaiting a follow up... And I wouldn't really consider The Seventh Scroll to be a follow up, but rather an Indiana Jones type story that holds some references to the characters in River god.<br /><br />I already felt let down and confused after the first 20 pages of Warlock. Something innate and compelling that permeated the world of River God was completely gone. The writing seemed uncharacteristically dull and rushed.<br /><br />Maybe it's something to do with the way the narrative was changed from the first person to the third. There was something intimate about the reader's relationship to Taita's thoughts in River God. The story alerted you to his flaws and arrogance by letting you listen to him brag and congratulate himself. In this novel, Taita is a bland and uninspired figure.<br /><br />I find it difficult to even recall the plot of Warlock. The characters were all 2-Dimensional and devoid of personality. If it weren't for the token Wilbur Smith gore and sex, this book would almost play out like a children's version of River God.<br /><br />In some ways this book disgraces the world that he created and brought to life with River God. It is impossible not to make the comparison, and while it is an easy book to go through, nothing in this one stuck for me. I was bored instead of fascinated.<br /><br />I actually found that by the end of the book, I was trying to discount it and just forget about it, so that it would not taint my attatchment to River God. In every way that River God was epic and inspired, this novel is boring and predictable.<br /><br />If it were possible to detatch it from the first book and enjoy it for what it is (a silly action adventure novel about ancient Egyapt), I might give it 3 stars... but it is absolutely impossible to do so, and in some ways I almost regret reading it.	2005-10-13

Books	5	57	58	N	N	Important Reading for Parents and Teens	Growing up Christian is not as easy a task as one might think. There are dangers and temptations unique to growing up within a Christian family and within the church and sadly these difficulties are often downplayed or misunderstood by those who have been converted later in life. Growing Up Christian seeks examine these issues, which, as a person who grew up in a Christian home (ie a \\"church kid\\"), are near and dear to my heart. The book is targetted primarily at church kids, though their parents would do well to read the book with them. The author, Karl Graustein, is a church kid himself and is now a principal at a Christian school, so is intimately aware of the issues at stake.<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections. The first lays out the blessings and the dangers of growing up in a Christian family. \\"Growing up in a Christian home is a wonderful privilege. We have been given so much: godly parents, training in the Word of God, friends from Christian homes, support from a Christian church community, and most importantly an opportunity to know God at a young age. Throughout our lives, we are repeatedly taught about the love of God, his plan of salvation, ways to recognize and resist sin, and living for the glory of God\\" (page 21). He goes on to recount other benefits of being raised in a Christian environment, pointing out that while we are given so much we are also protected from so many dangers.<br /><br />\\"Church kids face some unique challenges...Though surrounded by the things of God, we can still be drawn to sin and live double lives. We can easily assume that we are saved even if we are not; or we may be driven by a desire to be popular more than a desire to live according to biblical values. While it is a great blessing to grow up in a Christian environment, if we are not careful we can make some dangerous assumptions about ourselves, which have serious consequences\\" (page 22).<br /><br />I can testify from my life that I have seen both the privilege and the danger of growing up in a Christian home. I am ever thankful to God that He blessed me with discerning parents who, though they did not understand from their own experience what it is like to be a church kid, were unrelenting in sharing the gospel with us. Their efforts have been blessed as all five of their children know and serve the Lord. But as often as I have seen this type of blessing, I have seen the opposite, where the children of Christians fall away or live lukewarm at best, always assuming but never knowing that they are saved.<br /><br />The second section teaches kids how to think biblically. Graustein speaks of the importance of cultivating humility, of growing in gratefulness, of loving Scripture and of trusting God. He also covers what I might consider the most important topic in the book: developing personal biblical convictions. On the front cover of the book are the words, \\"Have you taken ownership of your relationship with God?\\" Just this weekend I was discussing this topic with my friend Doug and I suggested that this is exactly what the children of Christians need to do. For many years we coast along under the umbrella of our parents' faith. We do what they do and say what they say simply because that is what we have been taught. But there comes a time of crisis and decision. This is a time I remember from my own life. I do not know whether this is the moment I became a Christian or whether that was much earlier, but I do clearly remember the day that God allowed me to make my parents' faith my own. It was a day of transformation in my life. It is a day that I suspect all church kids have at some point.<br /><br />The final section deals with living biblically and the author discusses battling sin, the spiritual disciplines and stewardship of God-given talents. Much of this section draws upon and is consistent with the excellent teaching ministry of Don Whitney and his book Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life. Other clear influences on the author through this section and others are J.C. Ryle, John Piper, Jerry Bridges and C.J. Mahaney. Graustein is clearly a man who has spent much time in the Word and much time learning from sound teachers.<br /><br />All-in-all this is a fantastic book and one which I wish I had been able to read while I was a teenager still wrestling with my faith. To echo the endorsement of Tedd Tripp, \\"Karl Graustein gets it! He understands the pitfalls and dangers that track with the privilege of growing up in a Christian home. He addresses all the standard temptations...This book has a look and feel that young people will appreciate.\\" Growing Up Christian is a book I would unhesitatingly recommend to any and all Christian parents and teens.<br /><br />This is a bit unusual, but I'd like to make special mention of the person who designed the cover for this book. It is very well done and I suspect this book will sell quite a few copies to those who judge a book by its cover. Well done! If there are awards for this type of thing I hope you receive consideration.Other clear influences on the author through this section and others are J.C. Ryle, John Piper, Jerry Bridges and C.J.

The even though it said that a nation of blacks were to be slaves of slaves, it was not meant for all black but those nations of blacks who inhabited the land of the caananites. And even then it cant be called racist because the Hebrews having been increased in the land of Egypt had to have been blacks. Even if you belive that Abraham was white, which is unlikely coming from the Chaldeans(a black race), having interbreeding with the egyptians they would become black.  <br />The KJV of the bible with text changed and books omitted is a corrupted version of the books that Yashua taught from and read. I also agree with the reader who suggest english translations of the bible. Its important to read history with your study of the bible to get a better understanding of which version is the best to learn the truth. And with that study include science and all the arts you can to verify the truth in the bible( Job said that God made the earth and hung it on nothing, how did he know that?)And to those that say what does history and science have to do with god, well an omnipotent god creates all things and all are used to do his will. We might not understand it, but then again our thoughts are not as high as his. And as cruel and injust as slavery may have been it was meant to punish a people who contiually turned their back on the god that brought them prosperity. The strenghtening of the Gentiles(google the word to see who they are) to conquer and enslave the blacks was prophesied from Moses who said that Japeth shall dwell in Shems tent.

The Aboriginal Fulfilled Apostles, replete with New Age tracts and feminist ideals, is a closed society in danger of extinction without the infusion of new female blood. A matriarchal cult, much like the self-contained Amish culture, the AFA has existed for years without interference from the outside world. Threatened by natural selection, the elders send two representatives from their enclave in Butte, Montana into the world, commonly referred to as Terrestria, charged with sage advice: \\"If you're going to convert, you might as well choose the wealthy, who have friends.\\"<br /><br />At the beginning of their trip, the hapless missionaries, Mason LaVerle and Elder Elias Stark, stick to the rules, eating natural food and sleeping in the second-hand Dodge van provided for their journey, but before long they fall victim to temptation, gorging on junk food and watching television for hours on end, psychologically invested in the outcome of game shows and daytime soaps. Spurred on by a distant advisor, Lauer, who may or may not have taken up with Mason's ex-girlfriend, the newly-hatched evangelists paper small towns with their literature, often stopping for conversation with anyone who will give them the time of day. Cultural innocents, their entire lives spent in the clannish environment provided by their religion, Mason and Earl occasionally fall for dubious roadside advice, as when Earl buys crank from a local and the evangelists spend a lazy afternoon with two equally messianic underage Christian young ladies.<br /><br />The greatest culture clash occurs when Mason and Earl arrive at the tourist-friendly, snow-bunnied slopes of Snowshoe, Colorado. Snowshoe is a haven for the spiritually overindulged, wealthy dilettantes who hand-pick their beliefs from a variety of religions, creating a loose philosophy that requires little of them beyond discussion, a sort of elitist's compendium of moral values unburdened by personal responsibility. The missionaries are introduced to the local social hierarchy by Lara, an Emmy-winning ex-actress they befriend when her suicide attempt by antihistamine fails to produce the desired results. Lara is the key to the upper-class of Snowshoe that Lauer has suggested they cultivate, particularly the filthy rich old Mr. Effingham and his cronies.<br /><br />While Earl disappears into the bowels of the Effingham estate, there to spread the word, Mason is sidetracked by Betsy, a girl with an infamous past and a love of all things vintage, fascinated by Mason's discount store clothing and easy amiability. Earl and Mason are soon ensconced in a Neverland where communal damnation is an acceptable concept to an overfed, overspun culture, where every physical need is met and what to have for dinner takes on the importance of a summit meeting, \\"There was no such thing as separation here, not once you'd started listening.

Born quickly (4 hours) and weighing a healthy 9lbs, she was on the go from the moment she was born. Now she's in college studying archaeology and language -- reading being the major thing the professionals said she would never do or at least never do well. The social worker who showed up at my door with this book after I'd banged down the door of social services threatening to drop her off if they didn't help me (they said they didn't usually help parents with unruly kids, just abused kids of unruly parents) was the most angelic sight for my very sore eyes. <br />We've been through some upturned, out-of-control, oh-my-god moments over the years, but this book was the beginning of the very best steps I could've taken in raising this outstanding example of a human being.  <br />Raising these kids is no easy task and it's not for the weak of heart.

Well, I just did and it really held me.  I stayed up far too late to finish this and while I'm having to drink more coffee today to wake me up, I have no regrets.  The characters are memorable, as is the story.  Could it really happen, maybe not, but isn't that what we read fiction for?  To escape to worlds that can't really exist?    I was able to suspend my disbelief with no problems, finding the premise of a re-created German POW camp extremely fascinating.  And for those of you who ask, \\"Why would anyone want to get dressed up in an old uniform and play war?\\", just ask that question of all those Civil War reenactors.  They take it very seriously.  Anyway, is this Hemingway?  No, but that's not why I bought it.  I wanted a unique and entertaining read and I got one.  The writing is tight and keeps one turning the pages.  Thumb's up!	2005-10-13

Did find it at times somewhat juvenile. For example; when a character rides a horse in this story they  constanlty make it rear up. This annoys any real horseman or student of iron age cavalry. This story is supposed to be about iron age celtic warriors on sturdy gaulish ponies, not a girl's fairy tale of knights on white stallions. And Vercingetorix is given as a name recieved from birth rather than a title he had been bestowed with(Ver means high,Cinget means warrior, Rix means king.Ver-cinget-rix high warrior king) he would have been given a simple name as a child and called Vercingetorix only after he took command of the Gaulish army. And Vercingetorix is portrayed very young even at the climax. I find the notion of a boyish Vercingetorix unable to grow a respectable celtic mustache leading an army implausible. I would recommend it to young readers interested in the story of gaul, but not to the more sophisticated enthusiast.	2005-10-13

(I am responding for a Vietnam combat veteran who is dictating this due to lack of computer access.) \\"How can Mr. Kidder refer to himself as a soldier returning from Vietnam? Where did he return? and profess the negative reception that many of us Vietnam veterans received as a myth? You might as well say that there was no Holocaust! He is from another world than I am. I didn't go from Harvard to the military academy and back to an upper class lifestyle. I think that was the minority of the returning veterans. Most of us had trouble obtaining jobs for many years merely because of our status as a Vietnam veteran. Mr. Kidder, Have you spoken with other Vietnam combat veterans and asked them what their return home experiences were like? Were you there when the national news broadcasts filmed the behavior of the protestors at bases or airports during the war, and particularly at the peak of the war? Did you know that the military put us in buses with barred windows and shades pulled down so that we wouldn't get hurt? Did you know about the shame that thousands of veterans felt and still feel to this day about their fighting as soldiers in defense of their country? We were told to remove our uniforms, had no armed guards, our weapons were taken away, we had no means to protect ourselves and we were treated like prisoners being transferred to another prison. I would like to see him write that the reason that our country is overreacting in welcoming subsequent veterans home is a direct response to the guilt that our country feels for having mistreated Vietnam veterans. Is he not aware that it is on the collective mind of the American people that we cannot have another Vietnam war or return home? There were no flagwavers or parades or signs of pride shown us when we returned home. The only representatives of the American people that recognized us, in any way, were those who disagreed with the reasons our Government sent us into war or, thanks to the media, could not cope with the reality of actual combat.  My major concern at this point is that this book will further hurt surviving Vietnam veterans, their families, and that it will add to the myths already promulgated by others.	2005-10-13

In the first half of the program I thought I was going to give this one star, but the second half had a lot of ok advice - but you can find better advice for free on the internet. It is quite out of date - it talks about placing ads in the newspaper and says that computer ads are brand new and too new to comment on. <br />I'll list lots of the contents to give you an idea of the specifics that this talks about: <br />The speaker has a good speaking voice and is a pretty good communicator but the actual content is very poor quality. Almost all of the content is the same as in his other books/audiobooks. (e.g. \\"how to be outrageously successful with the opposite sex) <br /> <br />He \\"proves\\" that your inner voice is wrong because he can teach you to remember a 32 digit number in 30 seconds. But his method for remembering them involves a complex story he tells. And if you can't remember the exact order of the story, you can't remember the number. He teaches you how to convert the story into the number, but without remembering the complex story, you won't remember the number. <br /> <br />step 1... how to find people: <br />- Men should volunteer at local community theatre since there would be 15 to 20x more women than men. <br />- Women should go to free real estate and business seminars - 30 to 40x more men than women <br />bachelor/bachelorette auction <br />- Talked for 3 whole minutes about a dating service meeting that 400 singles attended but cost $5000 to join and the singles could have met others while at the meeting for free <br />- Put together a free dating service with printed out flyers and get a choice of the best applicants to date <br />- Be in a power position - e.g. teach something - adult school, community college - cooking, karate, dancing, travel, nutrition, fitness, massage, etc. <br />- If you're a woman, teach single men to cook. <br />- Men can teach \\"romantic cooking\\" or \\"cooking for the single woman\\", etc. <br />- Use personal ads (is talkingabout newspaper ones - for $10-$20) <br />he says quite a few times that most people who use personal ads aren't \\"geeks, weenies, and losers\\" <br />He gives a template where you fill in some blanks for writing a letter to newspaper ads, and include an \\"action photo\\" e.g. photo of sweaty man from playing tennis, not professional headshots <br /> <br />\\"Formula for great personal ad\\" (main points) <br />- bold capital letter headline, centred on the first line <br />- Heading: \\"I love firefighters\\" \\"I'm looking for an attourney\\" \\"Are you Mr. muscle?\\" \\"I have a passion for redheads\\", etc <br />- Keep ad \\"light\\" <br />- eliminate all anger, hostility, etc, from ad (e.g. say \\"no smokers please\\" not \\"smokers don't even consider asking\\") <br />- men, say you want a woman \\"in shape\\" not \\"slim\\" <br />- don't say you're sophisticated, high cultured, high class <br />- if you have children, mention it <br />- don't give up <br />- be honest <br />- don't \\"i love puppy dogs, rainbows, walking in the rain\\" or \\"I like sports, cars, and girls\\" <br />- don't be boring saying \\"single white female, etc\\" <br /> <br />He says many times that he interviewed many people about dating tips for his research and it doesn't make sense that this is the best he could come up with. <br /> <br />Talks about voice ads - \\"use if you have no other choice\\", discourages video ads. <br />\\"computer ads - brand new, too new to comment on\\" <br /> <br />About great and awful places to go on a first date. <br /> <br />What not to say on a first date. <br /> <br />- women should send flowers ??? <br /> <br />- be enthusiastic but not too enthusiastic <br /> <br />- what thoughtful gifts to give, etc. <br /> <br />and some other basic tips about dating and relationships.	2005-10-13

The book covers the likes of Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, Bonnie and Clyde, and others in a chronological order in regard to time.  This necessitates jumping from one outlaw to another, but I did not find this to be bothersome.  I would prefer that method as opposed to taking the complete \\"career\\" of each character.  Burrough states these characters led to the formation of the F.B.I.  Jealously ran rampant with J. Edgar Hoover at the helm since the country lionized Melvin Purvis after bringing down John Dillinger.  Purvis wasn't bashful about giving interviews regarding the part he played bringing down these thugs.  Hoover seethed at his former protege's publicity.  Hoover wanted no agent to get any individual credit.  However, Hoover, had no quams about having the public focus on him as the man who was responsible for bringing down these gangsters.  All these two bit outlaws shared one thing in common.  They always had to be on the alert to being discovered and caught.  Living in drafty apartments, sleeping in cars, bathing in rivers, having their bullet wounds treated by questionable doctors, and a desire to have a normal family relationship that normal people enjoyed all were part of the lifestyle all these shady characters had in common.  This book is a lengthy read, but it is well worth your time if this part of American history is of interest to you.	2005-10-13

He did \\"read\\" and learn the trade from another and did very well for that time.  Now, there is someone calling himself a Lincoln lawyer, which fooled me big time, as I expected it to be about one A. Lincoln.  The new one is about an unscrupulous, on the down side of life lawyer who has to do his business out of his car. I remember when Debbie Reynolds said that she had to live out of hers out there in L.A.     It shows what an unethical person does in the gutter as opposed to the very ethical A. Lincoln of the 1850s.  He was known as honest Abe.  You can't say the same for the lawyers represented in the new Lincoln book.  I have worked for lawyers, and had a couple as personal friends, and I have some knowledge of how that part of the law works.    To tear one down for no good reason, is to be on a par with such a seedy, lowdown attorney-at-law who is so low he can't afford a respectable office from which to do legitimate business.  Of course, Mickey and his father who gained the gangster's gun as a reward for getting a guilty person off, are not respectable. He was told not to ever let an innocent person go to prison, but that is exactly what he did and it is time to face the music of his own un-doing.  Only lowlifes would go to someone who does his business out of a car.  It amazes me that even a character in a novel such as this could belong to the Legal Profession.	2005-10-13

In her later years, Elphaba traveled with Liir, a boy sent out with her when she left the Mauntery she had lived in for so long. Although she never asked why the boy was to accompany her, the rumor spread that Liir was the Witch's son. Now Liir travels from her grave, escorting Dorothy and her Scarecrow friend to a second conference with the Wizard. Liir can't quite figure out whether or not he cares for Dorothy. His adolescent urges seem to keep getting in the way. It is of little consequence, though, as Dorothy heads confidently off at one point, never to be seen again. Word reaches him that the Wizard has abdicated and Oz is in political turmoil. <br /> <br />Liir has his own agenda, not the least of which is simple survival. He is found crushed by the side of the road, the victim of a brutal attack, and brought back to the Mauntery to take advantage of whatever recuperative powers lie with the maunts. Candle, a young woman thought to be mute and slow-witted, is soon charged with Liir's care. Her haunting music soothes his soul and brings about in him a remarkable recovery --- and stirs something else besides. She has wise words to give him, along with her simple love. <br /> <br />However, Liir has yet to discover what his own purpose is, what will give meaning to his life. He leaves Candle with a weak promise to return. He sets as his priority the task of finding Nor, a girl from his childhood who may be his half-sister. But the world is filled with obstacles, and Liir encounters more than his share. It takes many years and innumerable pitfalls before he makes any real headway. All the while, he doubts that he ever will succeed at anything. At each predicament, he wonders: What would the Witch do if she were here? Unfortunately, whether he can puzzle out the answer or not, he feels inadequate in every way, knowing he isn't Elphaba, nor does he have herpowers. But he may be in for a surprise. <br /> <br />SON OF A WITCH provides a whimsical forum for Maguire to espouse his political views. Despite being rather blatant, they are otherwise fairly benign. But the indulgences in gratuitous bloodshed, cruelty and some sexual peculiarities don't further the plot and seem superfluous. Still, looking behind the scenes of the Wizard of Oz story is marvelously intriguing. While Maguire didn't imagine the story quite like I would, it nonetheless is an extraordinary journey to the dark side of the Dorothy and Toto tale. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Kate Ayers	2005-10-13

I haven't read any of Carr's other books, but I know he's a well known and apparently respected author, so I decided to give it a try.  It's a good thing I got it free through my book club.<br /><br />Various plot threads, doled out throughout the book, went absolutely nowhere and/or were poorly explained or fleshed out.  Page after page was devoted to very dubious characterizations of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes and their supposed sibling rivalry, presented like two bickering pre-schoolers.  The entire book was presented in the most overblown prose imaginable, and the author's verbosity was mind-boggling.  As another reviewer said, the first half of the book could have been reduced to a single chapter.<br /><br />Most authors who attempt a Holmes story try too hard, but I've never come across one who botched it up this badly before.  IMO, every interpersonal reference, or 'reminder' that this book featured Sherlock Holmes, was incredibly forced and annoying.<br /><br />Don't waste your money!	2005-10-13

And her parents are far from contrite: \\"If we could have kept one country white-ruled, it would be an oasis,\\" her inebriated mother told a visiting stranger a few years ago. Instead, Fuller's story simply presents what it was like to live and think as a white African, in whites-only communities; she does not attempt to convey the Africa beyond her immediate experience. In other words, this isn't a book about living in Africa, per se; more specifically, it is a book about being a white African.<br /><br />I imagine that the reason the racial component of her account has received the most attention--and the most resistance--from readers and critics is largely because we have grown accustomed to confessional memoirs and reflective chronicles that depict such upbringings repentantly, regretfully, or harshly. Fuller's goal is to present her youth as it seemed to her then, not as it seems to her (and us) now. In fact, appended to the end of the paperback edition is a reader's guide in which Fuller acknowledges and explains (perhaps belatedly, for some readers) that \\"almost half my life was realized in a bubble of Anglocentricity, as if black Africans had no culture worth living and as if they did not exist except as servants and (more dangerously) as terrorists.\\"<br /><br />The cultural \\"bubble\\" aspect aside, \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\" is, I think, even more successful in presenting the comedy and tragedy of living in a uniquely dysfunctional family, which had more than its share of personal tragedies--including the death of three siblings. While Fuller's father was participating in combat operations on behalf of white rule against black insurgents, her mother was slowly losing her mind--descending into a maelstrom of alcoholism and madness. Some of her family's exploits have to be read to be believed. (I can't imagine what her parents, both of whom still appear to have been alive when the book was published, thought of their portrayals.)<br /><br />It's quite remarkable how the author manages to retain her sense of perspective, her dignity, and her humor (and she is quite funny, if dryly so). The other surviving aspect of her childhood is Fuller's love of her homeland--perhaps not the people, who (outside her family) are always viewed peripherally, but its \\"hot embrace\\": the sights, sounds, smells, and \\"the incongruous, lawless, joyful, violent, upside-down, illogical certainty of Africa.\\"d madness.

I have enjoyed her Rachel Porter, US Fish and Wildlife agent series since its inception for its compelling mysteries and wry humor, but this one fell far short of my expectations.  While everyone enjoys the back story of the continuing lives of the characters in a series, it is generally enjoyed as a backdrop, not the driving force of the book.  Basically, this book didn't have much of a story, jumping from one idea to another, then sloppily knotting them all together at the end.<br /><br />The story begins with Rachel coming to from a terrifying daydream in the middle of a self-defense class in her new home city of San Francisco.  She moved there with FBI agent boyfriend, Jake Santou, and gay transvestite friend, Terri Tune.  They're renting apartments from an old Chinese woman, Mae Rose Chang, who makes an attempt to teach Rachel to cook before simply disappearing from the story altogether.  Rachel starts out chasing down a butterfly poacher and checking out his lair before moving on to investigate a complaint of a missing biologist in Mendocino, which is supposedly the only known habitat of the rare Lotis blue butterfly.  Rachel senses there might be a connection between the missing biologist and the butterfly dealer she busted, so she makes a trip to Mendocino.<br /><br />She puts all that on the back burner when another gay friend, Eric, shows up, in search of his runaway daughter, Lily.  There's a bunch of stuff thrown in about San Francisco's underground vampire community that goes nowhere, and enough pro-alternative lifestyle remarks so as to be a blantant advertisement.  There's no doubt about which direction the author's politics lean, which could be a turnoff for any reader who disagrees with them.  When the search for Lily turns up a tattoo artist with a connection to the Lotis blue butterfly, it's a bit of a stretch, but some kind of thread was needed to tie all these loose ends together.<br /><br />Rachel always seems to be one step away from finding Lily, and always manages to stumble onto evidence about the big, evil butterfly dealer she's after at the same time.  She apparently enjoys road trips, whimsically zipping between San Francisco and Mendocino on a daily basis (6 hours round trip with sidelines about the Redwood Forest) until the conclusion.  Two other things bothered me.  Rachel drives an Explorer, yet needed a tow truck to pull her out of the forest when she went off the road, and then she just drove off and kept driving for days without doing any repairs to the vehicle.  Also, Rachel never does anything, she BEGINS TO do everything.  While I'm complaining, the first murder didn't even occur until almost page 200, and then bodies piled up like crazy in the last chapter.  Additionally, I didn't laugh or even smile at anything in this story, whereas Rachel Porter mysteries are usually full of chuckles.<br /><br />I highly recommend Jessica Speart as an author, but I can only recommend this book to fans of the series who don't want to miss a piece of Rachel's story.  This book was a giant disappointment to me, and I fervently hope it is merely indicative of a temporary slump, and not a major downturn for this otherwise very enjoyable series.together. <br /> <br />Rachel always seems to be one step away from finding Lily, and always manages to stumble onto evidence about the big, evil butterfly dealer she's after at the same time.

An Indian girl from the Coville tribe decides to go to a party at her girl friends boy friends house. She ends up getting very drunk and wakes up next to a naked guy. She gets her girl friend to pick her up, take her home, and confesses to her mom what went on. Its her word against his, and a rape test proves nothing. Her mom promises vengance, using \\"Indian Medicine\\". Her mother packs her American Indian ceremonial outfit( I have no idea what this consist of. The author gives us no details)and performs a ceremony for the Omak Lake Monster to appear and punish the evil- doers. A party of slightly drunken fishermen are the first to be attacked by the monster, and as a bonus the Lake Dead( Drowning victims wearing old fashioned clothes from the 19th centuary.)put in appearance. No one gets killed yet,just threatened.Phantom hitch hikers bum rides,scare the drivers and vanish.  A debunking scientist shows up,and goes out on the lake to prove every thing is just over active imaginations. The raper  and his buddies tow a fake monster out on the lake ( Yes, with fake Lake Dead along for the ride), to scare the scientist.The prankers put on a show, start to leave, and then ...you guessed it. The real Omak Lake Monster appears, with the Lake Dead, and works  vengance on the evil- doers , the poor scientist, and the no good sheriff.All of the scientist preparations, machine guns, automatic wheapons, grenades and a flame thrower do nothing  against the monster and the dead.I wondered exactly what kind of scientist this guy is .  Ms. Ellen Blue( Tribal attorney along for the myth busting trip ) almost gets killed. She normally does not drink, but decided onjust  one beer. As I read that paragraph I knew somthing bad would happen to her and it does . At the books end she in locked up as a mental patient and being questioned by the FBI.The agents belive she is a mass murderer who killed everyone at the lake.Even though they can not find a single body, they will not belive her wild story and when a agent shows her a drawing of a Liopleurodon she goes bonkers. And yes again, we are not given any details of what a Liopleurodon looks like.If the drawing was good enough to send her over the edge then I was just about there at this point. The author is vauge in his descriptions and this could have been a good book with more work. Just look at the cover, then  move on to something else.

This little ditty was absolutely delightful!   <br /> <br />It's a short book, a quick and light read that is comfy and fun.  The author does a wonderful job of keeping the characters true to their TV personalities that first drew us to them, and she mixes just enough comedy and Buffy-style one liners into the action to keep the reader chuckling. <br /> <br />I've read a few reviews where people say the toothache thing was distracting, or that they had a hard time imagining Buffy being so bothered by that kind of pain.  To that I can only say that they must not have ever had a severe toothache.  I have a plethora of medical conditions that involve pain, enough to fill a medical dictionary.  Hence my high pain threshold.  But a serious toothache can bring me to my knees.  I thought it brought out Buffy's human vulnerabilities in an amusing and totally relatable way.  It was a reminder that she's not immune to everything, even though she is the Slayer. <br /> <br />Spike was also very enjoyable in this story, toothpicks on his fingers and all.  And I loved how he was the only one who figured out what was troubling Buffy.  It paid nice tribute to his ability to tune in to her and see the things she tries to hide. <br /> <br />A fun read!

By focusing on young agents trying to enter the business he has found a perfect vehicle to let his readers understand the emotions of the business from the elation in landing a new client to the depression of having another , more experienced agent steal his clients. One can sense the commitment made by these young agents to their players as well as their naivete in expecting that such a commitment woujld be sufficient to retain those players as clients. Crasnick also does a nice job in exploring the relationships, both positive and negative, that exist between agents and major league organizations. For one of the first times, an author has focused a non-condescending,  literary light on the essence of the agent business, allowing the public to better understand an agent's role both as an influence on the financial aspects of his client's career as well as the development of that career. It's a must read for anyone thinking about entering the business and an enjoyable read for any baseball fan.	2005-10-13

As you read chapter after chapter and never read one natural cure you soon realize you've been ripped off. He reminds me of a child who was given a writing assignment of 1000 words and constantly repeates himself to make up that 1000 words. He'll make a statement \\"one he's already made what may seem like 100 times before\\" then he'll say let me repeat that. Then he'll write it again. You start begging him to write anything new. It's a sick excuse for a book. He says he has insiders. HA! He makes claims about \\"A\\" company putting chemicals in food to make you addicted or fat. He never names any companies that do this or what the chemicals names are. He just refers to his insiders. A person could easily get better free info at any health food store. he says you can trust what he says because he doesn't sell any pills. His pills are his books, news letters, web site, all of which you have to pay for. Every time he got close to telling you a natural cure, he just pointed you to getting the info from one of his news letters or joining his web site so you'll have to pay him even more money. Something tells me the info wouln't be there either.  This book is like an infomercial. It's just a vise to get you hooked on him thinking he has all this knowledge so you spend more money. Kevin and this book are such a joke. I can't say enough bad things about it. Here's the condensed version of his book and all you'll get out of it. Drink plenty of purified water, don't get hooked on prescription drugs, and eat organic foods, and if man made it don't eat it. That's the book.

I had heard good reviews about it, but I was still doubtful. The story's beginning was almost exactly as the summary on the back of the book said. The main character, Rannoch, is thrown into his destiny world, but for most of the book, he is unable to accept his destiny or defend his bretheren. This creates tensions between many of the other characters, and the ending is suprising as well. Even though I won't reveal what the ending is, I'll say this much; after the beginning you really won't know what to expect from the book. And as for being an uncreative fantasy, not a chance.<br /><br />This book touches on some topics that go beyond the simplicity of the story. For example: Most of the deer in the book are ready to kill and fight against their own kin, all it takes is a small difference between leaders and war breaks out. Its the same in real life too, war doesn't take as much to start as it does to end. And when the deer realize this, the only thing they can do is fight to the death, but that may not be what the leader of the deer really wants...<br /><br />After I started this book, I couln't put it down, I was suprised by all the twists and turns the book took after the beginning. Don't judge the book by the back cover, just read the book itself!<br /><br />Firebringer is a story of the choice of deer and the creatures of the woods as their lives are threatened by a Lord who knows no bounds to his cruelty, and has no allies, for he is the only ruler. As evil begets evil, vegence is abroad and the heat of war is in the deer's veins, the book's end is exciting and suspenseful. Read Firebringer!	2005-10-13

The so-called war on terror is not the first time the U.S. has employed abduction, torture, and murder to further its political agenda. As Ms. Harbury thoroughly and unflinchingly reveals, throughout the 70s, 80s, and 90s, the United States (directly and by proxy) abducted, tortured, murdered, and \\"disappeared\\" thousands of people in El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala, all in the name of fighting communism. It is a history that American nationalists ignore or claim never really happened. It did happen and we are witnessing history repeated itself in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the various nations to which we ship detainees to be tortured.

Trulson, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at the University of North Texas and one of Dr. del Carmen's former students.  In this text the authors provide a comprehensive and scholarly overview of the American juvenile justice system. <br /> <br />In addition to providing the reader with a sufficient theoretical and historical foundation, the book, comprised of fourteen chapters, explains in detail the various stages of the juvenile justice system through a rational progression.  The chapters cover such topics as: theories and measurements of juvenile offending; the role of police in addressing juvenile crime; intake and diversion; status offenders; dependent and neglected youth; juvenile victimization; the detention process and certification as an adult offender; the national court system; adjudication, disposition, and appeals; juvenile probation and parole; institutional corrections; juveniles and the death penalty; students' rights and school crime; and a look to the future. <br /> <br />Missing from the text - which is a blessing - is the clutter of unnecessary pictures.  Rather, the authors have included tables and exhibits that bear a strong relationship with the subject matter.  Too, they have included occasional scenarios designed to promote student discussion.  Each of the book's chapters begins with an outline and points to be learned, and is concluded with a summary of relevant points, review questions, and a list of key terms and definitions.  In addition, relevant websites are provided for further research. <br /> <br />The text contains three appendices relevant to the study of the juvenile justice system.  Appendix A provides U. S. Surpeme Court decisions relating to juveniles, and Appendix B lists the location of juvenile laws state by state.  The final appendix provides the reader with guidance on accessing and interpreting court cases. <br /> <br />Juvenile Justice: The System, Process, and Law is an excellent undergraduate text.  The approach taken by the authors in crafting this book will enhance the learning experience by those who use it.  Rolando V. del Carmen and Chad R. Trulson are to be commended for their contribution to criminal justice scholarship.	2005-10-13

Even though Pi lives and that probably required God's help, a story like that should not be called one that makes you \\"believe in God.\\" If you do not expect to gain truths about God and wish to fall into a captivating story of a young boys fantastic survival, Li of Pi can fulfill, but it can not fulfill its promise of making \\"you believe in God.\\" I rated it a four because of this disappointment in its lack of fulfillment in its promise and for a lack of definite conclusion. I did find the twist at the end with the other version of Pi's story to be fascinating. I had accepted pretty much everything he had told us up until that point, and I thought it was great that Pi could have been making up/ imagining the animals and other things. To me that seems to be a great coping mechanism for young Pi that helped him deal with the problems he faced. I do however wish that the author would not have left the book hanging with the reader wondering whether or not Pi's story with the animals was the one that really happened or the one with the humans. If the animal version was true, this would not necessarily make me \\"believe in God;\\" it would make me believe in the power of imagination.	2005-10-13

Whether you're an avid or new reader of IR romances this book is a great read.     The Bad:   1) The characters are A-typical or IR romances. Yvonne, the antagonist,is an emotionally broken, however, financially successful black woman who's been hurt in past realtionships. She meets the A-typical white male-also financailly successful, good looking, and also emotionally battered.     The Good:   1)While the characters are A-typical of IR romance novels, the characters have good depth. Each character displays a good range of feeling and emotions.   2)There romance is well written and develops over the story. You don't feel like they meet and immediately fall in love. It happens slowly and the author details it's development. The reader actually feels like they watched the relationship develop.  3)There is great sex. The sex scenes are steamy and slightly (well a little more than slightly) erotic. They are incredibly well written and form clear images for the reader.   4)Most importantly the race issue is handled incredibly well. The author deals with it without dwelling on it. Unlike some more expeirenced authors she doesn't allow the race issue to overwhelm the plot. The keeps the romance at the front of the story...which is refreshing.    Overall: This book was very well written and a great read. I don't have buyer's remorse and feel as thought it was worth all of the eight dollars I spent buying it (there is a reason there are very few used copies). This is an author to keep you eye on.	2005-10-13

That's what Bill Vancil did and that's one of the things that makes this book so appealing.<br /><br />Many people confronting a potentially fatal medical problem would be inclined to ask \\"Why me?\\" But, not Bill Vancil. Faced with prostate cancer, he immediately researched potential cures for his condition.  Not only did he succeed in conquering the cancer through a little known solution - proton radiation therapy - but Bill rediscovered his own humanity and spirituality in the process.<br /><br />Don't Fear the Big Dogs is a meaningful and educational book everyone should read; it examines the second highest cancer related man-killer that men need to know about. It also is a moving story of bonding between a 63-year-old father and his 13-year-old daughter. Tori Lou's inspiration is apparent in the spirit of the author's description of their adventure together.<br /><br />During six weeks in California and the trip home to Wisconsin, Bill and Tori Lou marveled at the world around them and discovered the world within them. The remarkable bonding of an older dad and a teenager ascending into adolescence is the soul of the book. At the heart of the book is an important message to men and their families facing the challenge of prostate cancer. By reading and re-reading Bill's inspiring story I am moved to conclude there are no coincidences.	2005-10-13

Bush. I wish people would read them. This is another enlightening book that glimpses inside the Bush Administration. Paul O'Neill is an extremely intelligent, down-to-earth public servant who happens to think, which is something that \\"ideologues\\" don't seem to find it necessary to do. This is how O'Neill described Bush: \\"An ideologue\\". To me, the consequences of the missed opportunities and the building of the deficit by the Bush Administration are frightening especially when he had brilliant people at his disposal 24/7. It will take a superior group of public servants to attempt to change course after this presidency is FINALLY OVER!!!!

As a summa cum laude graduate math major (of some years ago) I expected to enjoy an romp thru some beautiful mathematical ideas. Well, the ideas are there, and Havil is to be commended for gathering some unusual and interesting topics. And much of the extensive mathematical notation is supported with nice numeric examples. However, much of it is not. All too often there are pages of integrals, sums, and products that go happily on without a clue to some of the beautiful things that are happening. The most frustrating example is the \\"proof\\" of Euler's zeta function formula, one of the prettiest pieces of mathematics. I still cannot understand Havil's presentation. (It was thrilling to read the same proof in \\"Prime Obsession\\" by Derbyshire so I know it can be explained with simple algebra.) Also, \\"Gamma\\" appears to be intended to be read in one sitting since it is rarely possible to begin at an advanced chapter. It is assumed that you remember definitions and notations which have appeared long before. To the author's credit, there are occasional backward references by page number, but then, about half of these are frustratingly wrong. Finally, it would be nice to see a copy of the errata for this book. I hope this book appears in a 2nd edition where the level of its presentation is made much more consistent.	2005-10-13

I am of the generation whose grandfathers fought in the war and I have always been proud of the contributions made by members of my family. My maternal grandfather, Lawrence Belford, wished to fly bombers but was not permitted because of poor eyesight. Still, he served the Royal Canadian Air Force as a member of the ground crew, loading bombs into Lancaster bombers. He would often recount his memories of the war and at one point I even conducted an interview with him. My grandmother's brother, Harold, was a Spitfire pilot who lost his life in a mission over the Mediterranean. My paternal grandfather, George Challies, whom I never met, was a Lieutenant Colonel and I am unsure of his contribution, though I believe he commanded an artillery training centre in Quebec. When I was in college I majored in history (my minor was in euchre) and took every possible course that centered around the war years. While I have since turned to other interests I continue to have a fascination with the war and read about it as often as I am able.<br /><br />This fascination led me to read &lt;em>War and Grace: Short Biographies from the World Wars&lt;/em>, a book of brief biographies written by Don Stephens. The thirteen biographies have one thing in common - the subjects are all Christians. A few of these people were believers long before the war began, while others were converted during or after the war.<br /><br />What I found particularly interesting is that I knew of many of the people whose lives are examined in this book, yet I had no idea that they had become Christians. For example, anyone who has studied the war knows of Mitsuo Fuchida who was the chief pilot for the Japanese in the attack on Pearl Harbour. He is famous for giving the signal to attack and then crying \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!, the codeword to indicate that the Japanese had achieved complete surprise. But what fewer know, I'm sure, is that after the war he became a believer and spent the rest of his life in passionate, fruitful ministry to the Lord.<br /><br />Years after the war Fuchida crossed paths with another subject of this book, Jacob DeShazer, one of the Doolittle Raiders who spent several years in Japanese custody after his plane crashed. In prison he was given a Bible and in his autobiography he writes, \\"On June 8th, 1944, the words of Romans 10:9 stood out boldly before my eyes: 'If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.' In that very moment God gave me grace to confess my sins to him, and he forgave me and saved me for Jesus' sake...\\" After the war DeShazer became a missionary and spent much of his life ministering in Japan. His ministry continues to this day.<br /><br />The final chapter was the one I found most fascinating. The author writes about Henry Gerecke who was the Protestant (Lutheran) chaplain to the Nazi war criminals during their trial at Nuremberg. Dedicating many months to sharing the gospel with these men, he was blessed to see several of the highest ranking Nazis, men whose crimes live in infamy even today, humble themselves before God. I am sure very few have learned in school that among the last words of Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler's foreign minister, were, \\"I place all my confidence in the Lamb who made atonement for my sins. May God have mercy on my soul.\\" He then turned to Gerecke and said, \\"I'll see &lt;em>you&lt;/em> again.\\"<br /><br />Part of the beauty of this book is that Stephens writes with a Reformed understanding of conversion. He clearly sought out more than just good stories, but looked in particular for stories of true conversion. He leaves little doubt about those who gave their lives to Christ. The theology in this book is deep and satisfying.<br /><br />So I suppose this book came as a surprise to me. I knew many of the people, but I knew them only from secular texts which had nointerest in the spiritual dimensions of their lives. To learn of the deep faith of these people, faith that was often formed and tested in the most difficult of circumstances, was a very pleasant surprise. I highly recommend it.which had no interest in the spiritual dimensions of their lives.

We recommned this book for teachers and students because the information that this book contains, if studied properly should help both to reach a higher level of understanding and create a better techer/student relationship. It also puts parents, teachers and higher authorities to blame for something that is usually seen as a students inability to learn the subjects taught at school. Holt also uncovers the misleading conception that kids in private schools are not much different from the ones in public schools in an educational level. Although written in the early sixties you can relate to it because no matter your age you're either going through it or went throught it in some point in time.	2005-10-13

It started when he was in high school and ends after the 97-98 season.  It talks about change in careers and how he dealt with people telling him he wasn't good enough. <br />     Jordan first missed his high school basketball team, but he worked day and night to prove he was good enough.  When he was a senior, he led Laney High School to the Divison III championship and won. <br />     As a freshman, he made a good impression making a last second shot to win the National Championship. In 1983-84, he was named college player of the year.  The same year he was elected the co-captin of the United State's Olympics basketball team and helped them win gold. <br />     He was drafted third overall in the 1984-85 draft.  That year he won the rookie of the year award.  He was a superstar right away.  On April 20, 1986 he scored 63 points in one game.  April 16, 1987 he scored 23 straight points.  That year he set a single season record for points 3,041. <br />      1988 was a year full of rewards. He was named NBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year.  He also won the slam dunk contest for the second straight year. In 1989 he won th All-Star Game MVP. <br />      In 1991 Jordan was named NBA and Finals MVP and lead them to their first title.  In 1993 after winning the Championship the last three years. A tragedy happened in the Jordan family. James Jordan, Michael's father and best friend was shot and killed.  Then Michael decided it was time for a career change. He then signed with the Chicago White Sox.  After 18 months of playing baseball he missed basketball and came back to the Bulls in midseason, but they couldn't win the championship.  So the next two years Jordan worked harder then he ever had before to win the next two titles and then retired. <br />      This book states how valuable Michael Jordan was to the Bulls and NBA.  After reading this you know he was the best player ever.  I would recommend reading this book if you like basketball or a underdog story.	2005-10-13

We think that it's very interesting that Holt goes from class to class observing students to see how they participate in class, and then he tries to come up with solutions to help them become better students.

US	51277244	R1K7UYQMSBR6H5	0060753226	657787398	Buddha Baby	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Strong second half	This is the story of Lindsey Owyang, the Chinese, San Franciscan heroine of Keltner's previous book, The Dim Sum of All Things. Lindsey has two jobs, one at a museum gift shop and the other at the Catholic school she attended as a child. She also has a loving boyfriend named Michael, who spends most of the book at a vegan retreat. He's doing an expose for the magazine he works for, called Vegan Warrior. <br /> <br />While Michael is away, Lindsey finds herself drawn to Dustin Lee, one of the few other Chinese students at her Catholic elementary school. Dustin left the school after sixth grade (one of the nuns had a crush on him and kept pulling him onto her lap), and she hadn't seen him since. Now he's back in town and looking pretty hot, with a motorcycle. Lindsey's suddenly wondering why she's never dated an Asian guy. Dustin, in turn, has only dated white women. <br /> <br />In another subplot, Lindsey starts to wonder about her cranky grandmother's past when she finds some photos in the basement at her school. After some visits with her grandfather and one of the current students at the school, she pieces together some answers. <br /> <br />The first half of the book is a little disjointed. Before Dustin appears on the scene, and Lindsey starts investigating her grandmother's past, there is really no suspense or dramatic question to drive the plot forward, and readers may find themselves putting the book down. But the second half of the book moves right along, as the reader will want to find out whether Lindsey gives in to the temptation of Dustin. <br /> <br />The book also has some interesting observations. Lindsey talks about \\"Angry Asian Men\\" who give her attitude because she dates white men (her boyfriend is a quarter Chinese, but no one can tell from his appearance). However, the book is a little heavy-handed in its treatment of Catholic school; one of the nuns tells Lindsey that the school is much improved, and \\"now only practices mild corporal punishment\\". <br /> <br />Overall, this is a fun, interesting book that picks up considerably in the second half. If you enjoyed The Dim Sum of All Things, you will probably enjoy this book as well.	2005-10-13

I have worked as a resource teacher in the inner city schools, and agree with Kozol 99% of the time. It is not true that ALL inner city schools are unclean, and some cities are building new schools in the inner cities; but there is, without question, segregation because of the return to neighborhood schools.  <br /> <br />But this review threw me because I am currently teaching in a suburban school as a resource teacher: >>Mostly white children in 'nice' suburbs have clean and safe schools with a curriculum that stimulates their interests and creativity.&lt;&lt; <br /> <br />I won't argue with the clean and safe. I admit fully that I feel safer here than I did in the inner city - where several times I had knofes drawn on me, etc. No need to hash through all the horror stories. Bit to say that the curriculum stimulates interest and creativity in suburban schools is simply wrong these days. All schools are facing the same mandates from the feds: NCLBA, and because of that all creativity has left all but the very best teachers, and let's face it - those have always been few and far between. The main focus these days is getting children to pass the federally mandated tests, and that won't stop until we get some true leadership back in this country. I'm ashamed of the state governments who are rolling over backwards and bowing down to federal guidelines, and very happy for Utah and Connecticut for at least stepping forward and questioning the wisdom of NCLBA. It has destoryed the possibilty of creativity in the classroom for all studnets who are not lucky enough to run into the 1 in 100 teacher. And what's your chance in 12 years?	2005-10-13

It wasn't as stereotypical as I thought it would be though. It would have been nice if Raven, the main character, hadn't been a standard black-haired Goth but you can't have everything. Raven wasn't a particularly imaginative name...2 Goths actually featured named Primus and Poison! <br /> <br />I found this book pretty enjoyable though. It seemed to have about 5 different stories, but as it was all well written and Raven was a likeable (if sometimes quite soppy and girly) character, I didn't mind this. I was actually quite sad when it finished. I would recommend the book to somebody looking for a light read. I read it in about 3 days and yeah...it was good. The ending was quite disappointing though - hopefully this means there'll be a 3rd book...	2005-10-13

The episode is so dramatic that one almost forgets that the paramount reason behind the rough treatment afforded to the recruits is to decondition their self-preservative reflexive actions for battle, while simultaneously making them tough enough and hard enough to be still standing at the end of the day. ONE BULLET AWAY: The Making of a Marine Officer, completes the circle, and thensome. <br /> <br />Author Nathaniel Fick is among the best of the best, a former captain in the United States Marine Corps First Recon Battalion. ONE BULLET AWAY is Fick's unflinching account of his recruitment into the Marines, his advancement, and his service on the fronts of Afghanistan and Iraq. He gives the reader an up-close and personal view of what it is like to be a soldier. One element of military training that is often lost upon the layman is the importance of the history of warfare and of soldiering; as Fick notes here, marines learn from the mistakes of those who have gone ahead. Every marine accordingly has an obligation to ensure that the sacrifices of those who have preceded them are not in vain. <br /> <br />Fick's account of his role in modern warfare, which constitutes the balance of the book, is anecdotal at its most interesting, ranging from accounts of bravery, courage, and compassion to the occasional stupidity of commanders for whom the battlefield is more of a concept than reality. One comes away from this memoir with the feeling that, as with most things, it is miraculous when any project proceeds to completion successfully. In ONE BULLET AWAY, however, the stakes are much higher. <br /> <br />Fick elected to forego re-upping with the Marines, an understandable decision considering the events recounted here and their personal aftermath for him. ONEBULLET AWAY is a highly readable, personal memoir that rings and resonates with bravery, clarity and truth. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub	2005-10-13

How apt what a sweet novel to take a final bow on if that is the intent. As seems to be the format of Hard Case True Crime an imprint of Liesure Publishing it is short and as others mentioned a quick read.   This story is perfect for King to exit with for a few reasons obvious to fans not so obvious to non-fans. It is great because as in his best works it has King traits throughout. For instance his characters are realistic and plausible in their humanity. In fact the Publisher of The Islander Vince Teague and his editor Dave almost echo some of King's own remarks on the subject of writing and story telling/reporting. Another trait in the best King fiction highlighted by this story is an open ended ending. The mystery is not totally solved. Life is full of unexplained incidents and mysteries and this is definitely a case of art imitating life. Here there is the unknown but both in its length and ploting this focuses on the everyday and realness of life. Making THE COLORADO KID, I repeat an excellent coda for King especially with its relative thematic stirrings raised in FROM A BUICK 8 and its accessablity to the casual reader/fan.    The last point I wish to raise in this review is a light rebuttal about the comments from reviewers critiquing the pacing of the story. In my not so humble point of view I think the pacing is dead on accurate and King is a master of pacing he has brought it up on his musings on the craft and I feel the pacing of this tale albeit slow makes instead of breaks the story.    PS I had to tack on one more observation why this series is suitable for King's publishing twilight and that is throughout his career he has been accused by some as being a \\"pulp\\" writer and he finally wrote a \\"pulp\\" fiction novel;)	2005-10-13

A novel of family, fun, bonding and discovery set in the 21st century in the United States. The story's <br />narration  from a 16 year old girl named Sib, helps to capture first hand experience of a mission to find truth <br />in a life that broke very early on while sharing it with her father. Sarcasm, music and adventure mix to <br />create an experience and story for any daddy's girl. Recommended age 16 and up due to mature themes and <br />understanding. <br /> <br />This is not a very difficult read. The story does, however, require a good understanding of personality in <br />order to pick up on the true essence of Sib and her sarcastic nature. Brooks' writing is very comical and <br />interesting, making sure for there to be an entertaining story or reference every chance possible. Throughout <br />the story, the reader gets an inside look into a music prodigy's life and her family life. The first 50 pages tell <br />of Sib's life as a teenager and the trials and tribulations that she's beginning to realize, only wanting to add <br />one more in meeting her mother. After page 50, the trip to San Francisco begins. Taxi, Sib's father, begins <br />to slowly discuss her mother and the life that she lead previously. Continuing to use a first person point of <br />view, Brooks develops the story using imagery and reflection on a life that Sib never knew. With the <br />development of character throughout the story, the reader begins to be able to understand the situation and <br />Sib. At the beginning of the story, Sib is very laid back and focused on her musical ambitions. Toward the <br />end of the novel music is still a main concentration, yet family and the interest within begin to eat away and <br />creep into Sib's curiosities. Taxi, in an interesting parallel, is very easy going and easy to talk to, reflected <br />in Sib and the way that her attitude is. The road trip discussions and ease of conversation between the two <br />characters rolls throughoutthe trip, showing signs of connection through music and family bonds. This <br />dialogue between the characters gives a more emotional element to the story. With his style of writing, <br />Brooks make a very large effort and accent on family bonds and the consistent necessity of family in your <br />life.	2005-10-13

My interest in him was peaked by talk of the \\"Other Murakami,\\" the dark reflection of award-winning popular novelist Murakami Haruki.  My first Ryu book, \\"Almost Transparent Blue,\\"  was a captivating tale of bottom-feeders and gutter-life in tune with Irvine Welsh's \\"Trainspotting\\" and William S. Burroughs's \\"Junky.\\"  This dirty little tale grabbed my interest and got me hunting for the next adventure.  And then \\"Coin Locker Baby\\" blew me away.<br /><br />Unlike the semi-autobiographical nature of \\"Almost Transparent Blue,\\"  \\"Coin Locker Babies\\" is a full-fledged novel, an unsettling fantasy firmly rooted in a grim reality.  Taking its title and beginning on an actual cultural phenomenon in Japan, that of unhappy mothers abandoning their new-born children in train station coin lockers,  Ryu then manifests a strange Japan, an amalgamation of anime-world and modern troubles.  It is a place where Tokyo harbors a corrupted and polluted abandoned city, called Toxitown, right in the middle of its most exclusive business district.  A place where a fashion model keeps a full-grown crocodile in her swampy apartment, and a hero's greatest ambition is to kill everyone and bring peace.<br /><br />Into this bizarro Japan Ryu introduces two boys, the only survivors of the coin-locker baby fad.  A bi-sexual popstar (Hashi) who is slowly being consumed by his fame, and a jockish pole-vaulter (Kiku) who seeks to unleash poison death and silence the world.  Each has an equally fitting lover: Anemone, a ethereal beauty who hunts for a Crocodile Heaven, and Neva, whose breasts having been lost to cancer makes her the perfect companion for the bi-sexual star.  These four wind their intertwining lives together, never quite admirable but somehow remaining sympathetic.  One does not know whether to root for their success or destruction.<br /><br />It is a tribute to Ryu's writing that he keeps the reader always on his/her toes, flitting between reality and fantasy, rarely giving something solid to hold on to.  Originally published in 1980, \\"Coin Locker Babies\\" is eerily prophetic of the 1995 Sarin Gas attacks on Tokyo from the Aum Shinrikyo Apocalypse cult.  Kiku's desire to unleash the toxin Datura rings a little bit too true after the fact.  The translation is flawless, with important cultural notes seamlessly blended, giving the Western reader much-needed clues on otherwise unfamiliar cultural practices.<br /><br />While not able to fully yield to his depressing reality, I am finding myself more attracted to the dark vision of the \\"Other Murakami.\\"  I am eager to see what else this amazing talent has to offer, and will definitely be checking out more novels as they are translated., flitting between reality and fantasy, rarely giving something solid to hold on to.

This is a must-read for any aspiring actor or student of the theater, with its numerous lessons on perfecting a role of any size, professionalism, attention to detail, ensemble playing, integrity and the actor's responsibility to the audience.  The vignettes of luminaries such as Noel Coward, Maxwell Anderson and Robert Sherwood, as well as the accounts of the Lunts' influence on the careers of Helen Hayes, Uta Hagen, even Audrey Hepburn are icing on the cake.<br /><br />Reading this book is like completing a (good) acting workshop, a course in twentieth century theater history with huge doses of playwrighting and world history all rolled into one!  I do hope the CBS story will succeed in more attention being paid to this most deserving and influential pair.  Highly recommended!  `	2005-10-13

Children have been drafted by the scores to drive up its star count with glowing, irrelevant comments. Cynics have filled their reviews with off-topic screeds against evangelical Christianity while wagging their heads at a tragedy being exploited for political ends (!). I find it disconcerting that Amazon's usual criteria for Spotlight Reviews appears to have been suspended (or abandoned) in this case.<br /><br />Somewhere in all this, a young lady's life remains to be considered. Even apart from the Columbine events Cassie Bernall did, in fact, have an interesting story and this book tells that story. It was a story of identity, struggling with adolescence and immaturity, and the dawning of personal responsibility, faith, and redemption. Those who say she was a terrible Christian because of her earlier rebelliousness don't understand the Christian concept of forgiveness. She finally saw the direction her life was headed, her slate was cleaned, and she was actively learning to live as a compassionate, giving person who enjoyed life before she died.<br /><br />Everything that has happened since - from her senseless death to the confusion over multiple accounts of what was actually said during it - is no fault of hers and shouldn't diminish her intriguing, human story.	2005-10-13

It's actually a hybrid, two stories in one, but only one of them is good.  <br />In the good one, the author tells-in standard English-of her epic battle to stop chemical companies from polluting the Gulf Coast waters that she and her neighbors had fished for generations.  <br />In the bad story she tells us-in polluted English-about herself, using an ungrammatical persona that seems an affectation aimed at being perceived as a pugnacious, in-your-face, don't-mess-with-me woman.  <br />Too bad. She's an interesting, courageous woman in her own right, with no need of affectation. Almost alone, she took on the big corporations who with impunity were ravaging her Gulf Coast environment, spilling huge toxic wastes into land, sea and air with criminal disregard for public health, worker safety, state and federal regulations, and in general all God's creatures. These corporate behemoths were able to rape the environment because their deep pockets had bought compliance among venal local officials, political influence from Texas to Washington, D.C., and their hiring power and big payrolls silenced the easily cowed.  <br />The only person they couldn't silence or buy off was Diane Wilson, whose story is a model of how to fight both city hall and Goliath and win, and is a tribute to her grit and pluck.    <br />But why the author laces her story with such graceless prose is puzzling, and why the publisher let her do it that way defies understanding. Listed on the copyright page are the names of a Chelsea Green editor, a managing editor, a copy editor, and a proofreader, all of whom presumably worked with this manuscript.  <br />Did none of them know that bad writing in a good cause is not nearly as effective as good writing in a good cause? Did none of them know that a double negative actually says the opposite of what the speaker intended and that, in any case, nothing is gained for any cause by a disingenuous use of clumsy and ignorant speech?  <br />Didn't they notice that Miss Wilson told the story of her fight in standard English, but the story of how she felt about the fight in another English altogether, one that sounded too ignorant to have come from the same person who told the first story? <br />Maybe not. Dust-jacket copy bills the book as \\"a novelistic tale,\\" and Chelsea Green's specialty is environmental activism, not fiction. Anyhow, here's a sampling of Ms. Wilson's writing that somehow passed muster with an intelligent writer and escaped an editor's pencil, too: <br />\\"Doomsday don't always stay doomsday.\\" <br /> \\"I had ran out of answers.\\" <br />\\"So the coffee got drank and a jarful of candy got ate . . . `  <br /> Then there's the just plain bad writing: <br />\\". . . panic clambered through my body worse than two babies running through the hall . . .\\" <br />\\". . . he wasn't no dandelion tiptoeing around the issues.\\" <br />\\". . . the sun laid a heavy hand on her hair.\\" <br />\\". . . his tone was still as feverish as a preacher with a message scribbled in his pocket.\\" <br />On the plus side, here's one of the few good ones: Describing oystermen who filed in after a long day at sea to sign her petition, Ms. Wilson wrote, \\"They looked tired-as if the wind and the cold had blown out the light in their eyes.\\"    <br />A similar cold front must have moved through the editorial offices of Chelsea Green Publishing Company in White River Junction, Vermont, while An Unreasonable Woman was being prepped for press. Green River (and Ms. Wilson) should stick to straight-forward reporting from the environmental front.  <br />True-life experiences can be novelized with great effect. Truman Capote and Norman Mailer proved that with, respectively, In Cold Blood and The Executioner's Song. But they didn't pick an ignorant-sounding narrator to tell the tale.	2005-10-13

If you've ever wanted to read a book written by someone who is ungrateful and whines and thinks they are better than everyone else, this is YOUR BOOK!!!  This book is so long and drawn out and has NO POINT.  The author had absolutely no reason to write this book, other than to vent their ungratefulness on the rest of us. It breaks down like this: Polish family flees to Canada to escape the Nazis. They start out rough but end up doing quite well. WHERE'S THE STORY!?  The \\"author\\" goes on and on and on about how boring things are and describes her self-superiority over everyone else with paragraph after paragraph of just boring descriptions.  It's no fun to read.  She had it VERY WELL growing up in Canada - her family was safe and ended up making a good living there - WHAT'S THE PROBLEM!?  The author has an attitude problem - rather than try to make do in her new envrironment, she just whines and whines about it CONSTANTLY. At least her little sister tries to blend in. This one just cries about it and seems to think she can see more or understand more than everyone else around her.  News flash: YA CAN'T.  You are just like everyone else honey.  You should be grateful for all your parents did for you instead of fighting it every step of the way.<br />Don't read this book. It's boring.	2005-10-13

Temple to the Wind is the next creative non-fiction hit.  As you can tell by the editorial reviews provided above, Temple to the Wind is comparable to Seabiscuit, Fastnet Force Ten, and In the Heart of the Sea.  It really is that good. <br /> <br />The story of Captain Nat and Charlie Barr has been told numerous times in books with an academic and dry approach.  I know because I've read most of them.  Pastore breaks from that trend and puts humor, suspense and in-depth research into a book that is obviously well researched and written.  Pastore's lifetime in the maritime world, combined with his academic approach and fluent writing style give the reader a story that has been told multiple times, but never quite like this.  Temple to the Wind, like Reliance, is a winner.    <br /> <br />What I especially like about Temple to the Wind is its lack of \\"fluff\\" writing.  Instead of using fabricated dialogue to embellish and give voice to the characters, Pastore mined the available material (including personal letters and diaries of Captain Nat and Sir Lipton) at the New York Yacht Club, Mystic Seaport, and Royal Ulster Yacht Club to create the tension and interaction between the characters. <br /> <br />From my experience sailing and racing on the restored J boats Shamrock and Endeavour, and my time spent in the yacht construction industry, I can say that Pastore has hit the nail on the head when it comes to recreating the construction and racing of the great Reliance.  His description of the construction techniques used and the racing strategy are right on.  However, it needs to be stressed that Temple to the Wind does not read like a boat building manual or racing rules guide.  It is first and foremost a story about the characters that surrounded the boat. <br /> <br />For those of you who are unfamiliar with maritime terminology, don't worry, the extensive glossary provides accurate and understandable definitions and explanations.  The glossary also contains a helpfuland accurate illustration.   <br /> <br />Experienced sailors, armchair sailors, and history buffs alike, this book is either a perfect way to pass the winter months that are approaching or to enjoy while sitting at anchor next summer.   <br />	2005-10-13

It's Love in Excess, it's Gulliver's Travels. It's not Gulliver's Travel's, it's Oroonoko. <br /> <br />Actually, the first novel is probably Gargantua and Pantagruel by Rabelais. Or Don Quixote. Either way, it's not in English. And when it comes down to it, it doesn't really matter. Love in Excess (and the others around it) should be judged on its own merit, not in chronological/\\"novelistic\\" relation to other supposed \\"first novels.\\" <br /> <br />So, judged on its own merit, is Love in Excess any good? <br /> <br />Well, first of all, it's highly theatrical, in multiple senses of the word. Eliza Haywood was a successful actress and the novel is dedicated to a big former stage star of the day. (It'd be like a book being dedicated to Julia Roberts today.) The novel is composed in three highly-differentiable parts - they seem like they could be three acts in a play. The characters are often easily placed into types - one could imagine one person playing three of characters of the same type (e.g., the deceitful woman) that each appear in a separate part/act. <br /> <br />Love in Excess is, fundamentally, about exactly that - what happens when too much \\"love\\" is shooting around everywhere. Love, lust - whatever. Haywood delves deeply into what love is, and it's a very different notion than what we have. <br /> <br />Probably few people today read Love in Excess for its plot, but the story is worth it - convoluted, ridiculous, at points hilarious, full of outrageous coincidences, trashy, and by the standards of the day surely damn near pornographic. The syntax takes a little getting used to, but the book flows well as it goes on. <br /> <br />The main fault of Love in Excess to the modern reader, though, is that it's not saucy *enough.* Compared with romance novels (that phrase was once oxymoronic, but I think it makes sense even in relation to Love in Excess) today, you're left with a bit of the \\"That's it?\\" feeling.  <br /> <br />(Still, by the standards of the day...)	2005-10-13
US	51070201	R19LR3FM5K6SMS	0786713143	898854010	Shanghai Station	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Bull looks like he's kicking off another rollicking series	Bartle Bull proved that he could spin an exotic, thrilling yarn with his North African novels (\\"The White Rhino Hotel,\\" \\"A Cafe on the Nile,\\" and \\"The Devil's Oasis\\").  These novels were not \\"Great Literature,\\" but they were fascinating tales of derring-do, high romance, and dastardly villainy set in the romantic WWI - WWII era.  Creating strong characters and vividly capturing the harsh beauty of North Africa (as well as the seedy aspects of city life in such cesspools as Cairo), Bull transported the reader to a world he knows exceedingly well from first-hand knowledge. <br /> <br />In \\"Shanghai Station,\\" Bull launches what appears to be an exciting new series of novels, as \\"Station\\" bears all the hallmarks of a \\"kick-off\\" first novel.   <br /> <br />The novel opens in Northwestern Russia at the outbreak of the Communist Revolution in 1917.  Our hero, Alexander Karlov, is the only son of the noble soldier, Count Karlov.  Alexander must help his mother and twin sister Katia flee via the Trans-Siberian Railroad to Vladivostok, and then to Shanghai, to meet their father, who is off fighting the Communists.  Tragedy strikes as the train is attacked by Communists, and there is murder and a kidnapping. <br /> <br />Alexander arrives in Shanghai with a shattered leg and a vengeful heart . . . along with the aromatic tobacco pipe of the novel's arch-villain, the Communist fanatic Victor Polyak.  Reunited with his father, Alexander and the Count escape to Shanghai, which at this time is the Casablanca of the Orient.  Thousands of Europeans populate this city, one of the largest in the world, with official settlements.  Alexander and his father must scrape out a living in an unforgiving cityscape of cutthroats, prostitutes, thieves, warlords, corrupt government officials, and the Chinese gangs known as the Triads.  They meet friends and foes, and it's not always clear whether a friend is indeed a friend, or if a foe is actually a foe. <br /> <br />At the same time, the younggorgeous American Jessica James, daughter of Presbyterian missionaries, is trying to help the embryonic Communist Revolution in China.  Zealous, motiviated by classic \\"American Christianity,\\" Jessica (or \\"Jesse,\\" as she likes to be called), is swept up in forces she doesn't entirely understand.  To say that she undergoes a harsh maturation process would be an understatement.   <br /> <br />By the end of the novel, the reader is breathless from the triumphs and travails of our heroes and villains.  The final scene, a wake for a beloved character, concludes with a toast \\"To Shanghai!\\"  It is a toast the evokes the hope that Bull will continue to explore this rich city and his band of intrepid characters, and that he does so soon. <br /> <br />In a novel that ranges from the Mongolian steppe to the most intimate pleasure rooms of a Shanghai brothel, \\"Shanghai Station\\" transports the reader to a distant, romantic, lethal world.  Bull captivates with his description of the ravenous \\"debt collectors\\" used by a Shanghai crime lord to teach lessons that last a lifetime as much as with his lush descriptions of the repellent Russian Prince Krupotkin, a distant cousin of Alexander's who runs a thriving casino in Shanghai.   <br /> <br />From the author's notes in the book, this novel is intensely personal.  His father and uncles spent a lot of time in Shanghai and had a close friendship with a royal Russian.  The Bull family's devotion to the art of fencing also comes through, as does their fascination with the most noble of animals, the horse.  Bull concedes that he has made several deviations from the historical record, and that's fine -- we're not reading Bartle Bull's novels as a surrogate for actual history. We're reading it for thrills, chills, laughter and tears.  And Bull brings the goods fast and furious.   <br /> <br />Check it out, and let's hope that Bull can continue the series with more novels to come.	2005-10-13

Dr. Poland takes great pains to explain the minor actions that influenced not only the armies, but the two nations as well.  <br />     The battles are descibed in detail and set the stage for the following years of war in the Eastern Theater.  Much of the information concerning western Virginia (present day West Virginia) is usually absent or diluted in most modern accounts. <br />     Dr. Poland also examines the press accounts of this period in the war and contrasts the sentiments of the public in the North and South.  The book is well footnoted and gives many examples of newspaper coverage.  This is especially enlightening in the current climate of news coverage. <br />     The division of the conflict into the four invasion corridors makes the information easier to follow and allows the reader to better visualize the conflict.  This is important because the information is sometimes tedious by the nature of detailed troop movements. <br />     While this book and its detailed description of minor, athough fierce, battles may not hold the interest of the young or casual reader, it is a must for any student or buff of the Civil War in Virginia.  It is also good for those generally interest in Virginia/West Virginia history.  Attention to detail is required to read this, but it is that amount of detail that makes it worth it. <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

I am a huge fan of Picoult's, and was really looking forward to this new book. The story is that of Cordelia Hopkins whose father gets arrested for having kidnapped her when she was a child.     The problem with this book is that they are lots of main characters, most of which add absolutely nothing to the main storyline. Picoult spends numerous chapters describing horrendous conditions in an Arizona jail and the life of old  Native American lady dying of cancer. While they were interesting, they were a waste of time in that they added nothing to the main story.    In addition, Picoult's description of Cordelia's relationship with her future ex-husband and future husband are pretty unrealistic, which is really disappointed as Picoult usually gets feelings and relationships right to a t.    If you want to read a really good Picoult book, read My Sister's Keeper or The Pact, but not Vanishing Acts.	2005-10-13

Even more than that, having personally been a Mike Warnke fan many years ago, I had noticed on my own that his stories do not line up. With that in mind, I sat down and sketched out many of the simple facts that do not add up. I encourage anyone with an interest in Mike Warnke to step past their own emotional responses and actually study Mike Warnke's words.<br /><br />For example, if you were to listen to all Mike Warnke's concert recordings and keep a journal of everything he claims, and then compare the notes from the individual recordings and the Satan Seller, you will quickly realize on your own that Mike's portrayal of his own life just is not possible. His story of his own life changes too greatly over time. Additionally, the timeline of events as Mike describes cannot be accomplished on a calendar. Although some errors can be attributed to the passage of time and the possibility that a fact or two can be misplaced, the staggering number of incongruities that occur in Mike's own words are just too many to be shrugged off. After amassing such list of apparent mistakes on your own as I have suggested, sit down and read this book. You will see that not only does your list make sense and Mike's life does not, but you will be able to fill in many of the causations and backgrounds for the inconsistencies.<br /><br />I find it amusing, however, that the people who are accusing the writers of this book of dishonesty are also stooping to name-calling, and at the same time degrading the book's authors and promoters as name-callers. That's like saying, \\"Stop calling me names, you pooh-pooh head!\\" I understand that there are a great number of people that loved Mike's public image in the past, and several people still do. This causes an emotional reaction to the truth, and that makes it almost impossible for some people to take. For example, most people have been around the Internet long enough at this point to have seen an Urban Legend or two. When you point out that someone has forwarded you an Urban Legend, there is an underlying realization by the sender that they have just been fooled. They become embarrassed, defensive, and sometimes deny the truth by trying to back up the story with allegations that the story was verified by other sources. There comes a time when you have to put aside your emotional reaction to a situation and just analyze the facts.<br /><br />I also find it interesting that one of the reviewers seems to base his assertion for Mike's innocence on a personal conversation that he had with Mike. Although I am not 100% sure, I feel that most people would be easily subdued by Mike if they spent an afternoon with him. That's part of Mike's recipe for success - his charisma is unmistakable. Like a skilled artist, Mike knows how to make you see \\"his\\" side of the story, regardless of any basis in fact.<br /><br />That being said, the accusation that Christians \\"shoot their wounded\\" is all-too-often true. If Mike had come forth and openly admitted that he had lied, asked forgiveness from those that he had offended, and the church still treated him as an outcast, then the church would be guilty of such a crime. But with Mike Warnke, the reverse is more the case. Mike has wronged a great number of people, and yet he still maintains his innocence and claims to be the victim. (The closest that Mike has come to admitting any wrong-doing on his part was to assert that he had exaggerated slightly.)<br /><br />From having studied human behavior, there is an explanation to Mike's actions. Mike's stories and defenses seem to put him more in the category of a Pathological Liar and not a Compulsive Liar. For those of you that have never met a Pathological Liar, they are interesting people to know. Compulsive Liars simply tell lies for personal gain or self-preservation. They are aware that they are lying, but they can justify their behavior patterns to themselves. (This behavior is frequently forgiven by others because of Situational Ethics, but I digress.) Pathological Liars, on the other hand, tell lies for a myriad of reasons, but believe their lies as deeply as we believe the truth. Therefore, they can defend their lies with a zeal that parallels the defense of truth. Having personally known a few Pathological Liars in my lifetime, it is frequently hard to distinguish their truths from their lies. Because of this predisposition to dishonesty, Pathological Liars often lose the trust of everyone around. And unless they make an attempt to regain trust, they may never be trusted again. Mike Warnke's conduct suggests that he is not concerned with regaining trust, because he continues to assert that he never lied, even when faced with insurmountable evidence to the contrary. Because of this, Mike's behavior can only be categorized as unrepentant.<br /><br />This leaves us with a few questions and answers:<br /><br />Should the church reject Mike Warnke? Absolutely not.<br />Should Mike Warnke be forgiven? Yes.<br />Should Mike Warnke repent? Yes.<br />If Mike does not repent, should he still be forgiven? Yes.<br /><br />But the most important question: If Mike does not repent, and we have forgiven him as the Bible instructs, should he still be trusted?<br /><br />That answer, I'm afraid, is NO.r is frequently forgiven by others because of Situational Ethics, but I digress.)

The narrator, a drifter still married after six years but no longer living with his wife, encounters Tim (a Vietnam vet with a mean streak and strung out on drugs and booze most of the time) and his girlfriend Sylvia. The narrator becomes obsessed with Sylvia, though she keeps him at a distance out of mixed up loyalty to Tim (though he doesn't love or want her anymore, and she knows it).<br /><br />They concoct a plan to blow up a dam in the West, and the novel traces their actions in fulfilling this plan while contrasting the unrequited love interest the narrator has for Sylvia. Both plans are basically a disaster (Tim blows himself up along with the dam), and that's the irony in the story.<br /><br />Harrison makes these not very appealing characters interesting and worth watching as they proceed down their self-made road of doom. (That's where he failed in his first novel.) The narrative moves along to its conclusion powerfully, and we get swept up in it effortlessly. Harrison has great narrative skill; portraying these particular self-destructive anti-heroes locks the book into a specific time frame, however, that I hope he breaks out of in the future.	2005-10-13

Loosely based on real-life ancient history, this book is a feast for young imaginations with glimpses of past Assyria (the modern day Middle East), Egypt, and hieroglyphics.

As always, T.M. Wright is at the top of his game.  This book puts you in a trance with it's smooth prose and mysterious imagery.  T.M. Wright makes the reader work.  And the more you work, the more you uncover.  I loved everything about it.  In a market where horror writers try to top each other with violence and gore, T.M. uses his incredible skills as a wordsmith and storyteller to stand out.  In time, at least within the intelligent horror community, T.M. Wright will always be known as one of horror's pioneers and the most original and effective ghost story writer in history.  Without question, The Eye's of the Carp deserves the Bram Stoker award.	2005-10-13

I *love* this cookbook.  It is gorgeous (with many full color photos), and the recipes are clearly written to ensure success.

And you'll find recipes from names you'll recognize and admire, as well as those you won't know, but who are sensational cooks generously sharing their treasured dishes.

Until this book, Joseph Smith biographies have either been hagiographies or have treated Smith as a charismatic charlatan.  The hagiographies are of little interest to those seeking a reasonably objective and scholarly account.  However, the books treating Smith as a charismatic charlatan fail as well, for they offer no understanding of how Smith succeeded in setting up a religion which not only survived but thrived after he was dead.  And it is this which makes Smith worth studying.  There are more interesting characters than Smith to study if one's interest is just debunking a charlatan.  It is how Smith succeeded at what Harold Bloom calls \\"religion-making\\" that sets Smith apart.  And it is here where Bushman exceeds any other Smith biography - indeed attempts what no other Smith biography attempts.  This is to try to understand Joseph Smith as a creator of a new religious worldview.  Of course, all of the controversial matters are covered fairly and as completely as space allows in a one volume work.  However, this biography also for the first time gives us a realistic portrait of a very human and flawed man who nonetheless behaved as though he was driven by a holy vision, a vision of a saintly commonwealth both in the heavens and on earth - a vision which engaged thousands of his contemporaries and continues to engage millions today.	2005-10-13

The word ha'ole for example, has the root 'ha' meaning breath, and the word ole meaning without.  So the word used initially to describe missionaries that came to Hawaii, has the secondary meaning, those who pray without breath.<br /><br />Within this book is an explanation of the ha rite, which uses breath combined with prayer (intention) to generate mana which is sent to your higher self to manifest what you want in your life.  This is a very powerful technique.<br /><br />I have combined what I have gotten from this book and a few other sources, and using my intuition have come up with something very effective.<br /><br />The Huna commandment on page 72 is not to harm another.  So using this technique to interfere with someone's free will would not be appropriate.<br />If you do wish to focus on someone work for their highest good. If you wish to manifest love in your life, you can have a person in mind who seems ideal, but ask for this if they are agreeable on a higher self level or for someone equal or greater.<br /><br />In this book you will find described many concepts such as ho'oponopono, and the concept of the three selves, middle self (ego), lower self, (subconscious or hidden self), and the higher self (superconscious or superego). According to this system you would integrate all these aspects of self, and clear out the blocks or complexes within your lower self so you can manifest through your higher self.<br /><br />Further reading I recommend would be 'Mastering your hidden self' by Serge Sahili King, which also describes the Shamanic principles for creating your own reality.  These were life changing for me. I also highly recommend \\"Go up and work with God' by Vianna Stibal, a healer.  In that book she describes a manifesting ritual from her Huna studies.

Certain passages simply didn't make any sense.

I could read shojo to get this type of experience. What I liked about Volume 1 was its zany and offbeat humor.

Many other baby books left me with the thought, \\"How in the world will I ever find time to fill in all of these blanks?!?!\\"  This book is perfect!  You just write in it when you have time or when something important or funny happens. It takes  VERY LITTLE TIME to fill out an entire page, and each page lends itself to recording many notes so you won't forget things later.  It is a guilt-free, stress-free, FUN way to record a ton of memories and I know my son, now 10 months, will appreciate all of the details.   <br /> <br /> <br />What I like: <br />-  Flexibility: You can record a page for any month from 1-24 months. Including quarter, half and three quarters of months. <br />-  Plenty of pages. <br />-  The places on each page for likes and dislikes (which change constantly). <br />-  There is a place for height and weight on each page (which I don't always fill in, but it's nice that it's there). <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />In the back of the book: <br />-  You can draw in and put the date of teeth as they come in. Too cute!! <br />-  There is a place for recording baby's reaction to first foods and songs. <br />-  There are pages to record the big important hospital info as well as \\"names we thought of for you\\" and \\"what we called you before you were born\\" <br />-   There is a place to date when baby startstalking, clapping, walking, etc. and a place to record and date first words. <br /> <br /> <br />-  I could fill this any for two kids at once, because it's so quick. <br />-  It's fun to read and to have family read.  It's fun to see how the baby has changed. <br />-  The artwork is cool. <br />-  It's thin and hardback, so it's easy to travel with. <br />-  It skips the things I didn't want to have to fill out in the other books and focuses on your baby's development. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Bummers: <br />       -  It only goes to 24 months. <br />       -  I wish there were more space for foods. <br />       -  Sometimes I can't fit everythingon one page...when this happens, I just use 2 for the same age. :) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I also use this to make notes of trips that we have taken or the first time our son was babysat.  I plan to supplement this with a simple photo album or a scrapbook if I have time some other year.    <br />You won't regret this buy!	2005-10-13

Nothing could be further from the truth.  Antonin Artaud was a man interested in nothing less than the violent exhumation of real life from the cold, icy tomb that civilization has attempted to seal it in.<br /><br />As we see here in his letters to the sympathetic, but ultimately helpless Jacques Riviere, Artaud's suffered from a kind of hypochondria of the mind which resulted from his scorching intensity of thought.  He explicitly rejected happiness as the goal of human existence, and this is what separated him not only from the surrealists but from other thinkers of his age and ours.  Perhaps he put it best himself in his own strange, archaic language:<br /><br />\\"For nothing bestializes a being like the taste for eternal happiness, the search for eternal happiness at any price, and mademoiselle Lucifer is that slut who never wanted to abandon eternal happiness.\\"<br /><br />There will be nothing in this anthology that the Artaud admirer has not already seen, although the whole text (particularly the photographs of Artaud starring in Dreyer's \\"Joan of Arc\\" and Gance's \\"Napoleon\\"), comes together like a bizarre little work of art.  I have referred to it repeatedly, given it away, purchased it again.  The most important piece that this little publication has to offer is \\"I Hate and Renounce As a Coward\\"..., which is at the very end:the closest thing we have to a coherent philosophical position from Artaud.  Also, \\"Van Gogh:The Man Suicided By Society\\", which is more about Artaud than Van Gogh, gives us an indispensable glimpse into the psyche of the genuinely tortured, doomed artist.<br /><br />There are moments in which Artaud becomes as important in his commentary on the human condition, as thinkers like Nietzsche, Plato, Pascal, and all of the greats.  Unlike in their work, though, it is not maintained consistently.  This is also the case with his poetry.  His internal anguish did not allow him to consummate his enormous potential.  His value lies in the threat he poses to our complacency simply by virtue of his memory.<br /><br />Read \\"The Theatre And It's Double\\" first, and then tear through this.  Savor Artaud's sentences as you would a delicate meal you'd never tasted before.<br /><br />May the looming shadow of this demented renaissance man never stop haunting us.ently.

Krugman is the winner of the John Bates Clark medal in economics, the second highest economic award next to the Nobel Prize. The Clark medal is also considered by many to be harder to get than the Nobel because it's only given every two years. And yes, Krugman is considered a favorite to win the Nobel in the near future. The Economist, the world's preeminent economics magazine which has a self-admitted conservative bent, has called Krugman the most creative economist of his generation and has said he is the finest economist to become a media star since Milton Friedman and John Maynard Keynes. That's pretty heavy company. He has penned numerous scholarly book and articles as well as textbooks that are considered standard in higher economics classes worldwide. Those who call Krugman a hack or a liberal hatchetman are flat-out wrong, no matter what side of the political spectrum one is on. The only evidence that Krugman is a hack exists in the bent mind of a rabid conservative.  <br /> <br />Is he partisan? Well, that's a little tougher to pin down. He is certainly a liberal and this book relentlessly attacks the Bush administration. However, to say someone is partisan to me implies that they let their bias dictate their beliefs, rather than the facts, which is not the case here. Over and over, Krugman points out the differences between traditional conservative economic philosophy and the Bush administration's philosophy, which isto say, no recognizable or reputable economic philosophy. Hell, Krugman even served for a year on Reagan's council of economic advisers, and has written extensively on the ills of European-style socialism and the possible harms in limiting global markets. Remember too, that this is a selective collection of essays and columns over a period of four years, not a give-and-take narritive tome that takes on counter-analysis. <br /> <br />The question of whether or not the book is slanted really depends on your point of view. One thing is for certain, Krugman proves his case over and over again using non-partisan statistics and reasoning. The numbers he presents are not incorrect. He correctly points out how the Bush tax cuts, once fully realized with hidden provisions, will severly weaken the economic structure of America in terms of being able to support initiatives. He correctly points out in the article \\"Bad Heir Day\\" how the elimination of the estate tax will only benefit a very few mega-rich citizens, not small businesses and farmers. There is not a single article that has no basis in fact and irrefutable evidence. That is not partisan, that is fact. The writings are clear and are concise, and the limited space of a column does not stop him from presenting a strong case every time. <br /> <br />But the real question is one of point of view. Most people, myself included, would look at this book and be very troubled. But the people who will disagree with that assesment and therefore would not like this book would see what the Bush administration is doing and think it is good. They are starve-the-beasters. They would think that cutting all this money and destroying the system as we know it is good, because to them, it means the dissapearing of social programs because of a budget \\"crisis.\\" Supply-side economics is a joke, and has been regarded as such by most professional economists since its inception, but if you view the cutting of benefit programs and cutting taxes on the top 1 percent almost exclusively as positives, then you will most certainly disagree with Mr. Krugman.  <br /> <br />I hope and pray though, that people who do will be out of power soon.	2005-10-13

I first learned of Alan Alda's book when he appeared on the ABC news show 20/20 last month. He was talking about his mother and her mental illness. I'm a long-time fan of Alda and I was fascinated about the story he told the interviewer. I ordered the book, eagerly anticipating a really good read. I was rather disappointed. <br /> <br />I won't go though all the things others have said here. But, I will say that, for a man who's written many television scripts and screenplays for movies, Alan's book could have been better. <br /> <br />While reading, I was struck with the feeling that Alda seemed to want to tell the reader more but he held himself back. There are many places in the book where he introduces a topic and then, in the next sentence, he changes the subject. Why? This is confusing. Either write more about the topic or take the sentences out.  <br /> <br />In the chapter about M*A*S*H, the writing improved a great deal. The tone of the writing was much more relaxed. Alda seemed more connected to what he was writing about. The 'tension' I felt in the writing was gone. The chapter about his surgery was also well done. <br /> <br />Another thing I noticed--the editing of the book could have been better. There were many sentences that were sloppy; sentences which could have been tightened without losing Alda's voice. <br /> <br />**To Robin: How do you know that Alan Alda doesn't *have* to work due to royalties from M*A*S*H?  After a number of years of having a show in syndication, television actors receive pennies on the dollar in royalties. It is disingenious of you to say that Alda doesn't have to work. Alda himself has said (in interviews) he has to work. Whether for financial or creative reasons, that shouldn't be up for speculation.	2005-10-13

It isn't afraid to keep the action moving. Barely a page goes by without a change of pace or a new scene to take in. But a book needs to have its action bound together, and this is perhaps the book's greatest plus point. There is not one central theme, but several - all relevant to the The Prisoner, but previously largely unexplored within the series.  <br /> <br />The main themes - the cult of Celebrity, Mass-media, information technology, \\"Big Brother\\" Society, and terrorism, are all dealt with extremely well and whilst we might think of these as modern themes, and perhaps easy for the writers to explore, it's not so easy in practice to inject these into the Village setting, but somehow Blum and Booth manage to do just that. <br /> <br />When reading about a character called Number Six, one can't help but picture McGoohan uttering the lines, or performing the actions, and whilst this is the fault of this reviewer, the authors have to accept that in setting the book during the TV series, with McGoohan's Prisoner the lead character, most people reading the book will be doing the same. And this is perhaps the book's one failing, despite at times a damn good effort by the writers. <br /> <br />After a while I mentally changed from thinking of Number Six as McGoohan but as a \\"generic\\" Prisoner. This makes the book a more enjoyable read, in my opinion, but does this mean the authors have ultimately failed? Possibly, but not as far as I am concerned. \\"The Prisoner's Dilemma\\" isn't an additional episode fitting perfectly into \\"The Prisoner\\", but it doesn't have to be. It isn't an indispensible aspect of the \\"Prisoner\\" opus alongside such greats as \\"Free For All\\" or \\"Checkmate\\", but it was never meant to be. It isn't a perfect example of McGoohanesque dialogue. That would be impossible.  <br /> <br />What it is is a very good read. The themes explored are brave, without being reckless. The writing includeshumour, without lampooning the series. The approach is daring, without being arrogant. It references the series, without ripping it off. It's fast-paced, without getting sidetracked. And, perhaps most importantly, it dares to be different without being ridiculous. <br /> <br />Rick Davy (The Unmutual Website)	2005-10-13

There are so many actors who are not interesting, Tab is. And what is fascinating is that he doesn't think so.  He's a superb person, actor and singer.  He is a great horseman and loves life.  This man has remained in the shadows of lesser stars for years because he didn't have the desire to remain famous.  But now that he's doing a book tour, I think even Tab himself is surprised to find an audience not just of baby boomers but movie lovers and yes, even new fans are coming around to meet him.   This book however is the most honest portrayal of his life and his career.  It shows us the downfalls of stardom but also the joy he has and the grateful feelings he has for his true fans even now.  Tab talks about being gay in Hollywood in the years that it could destroy your career.  Gone are those days, thank goodness but thank God Tab is not gone.  Still with us, still a star!  Buy this book, I have an advance copy and I have read it four times and each time I read it I realize how much I respect this man not just as an actor and movie icon but as a human being! Thanks for your honesty, Tab!	2005-10-13

When Annie goes into her kitchen to microwave some leftovers, much to her surprise, she finds a naked man...a gorgeous, perfect naked man standing there.  Desperately, she would like to believe he has amnesia, but the people shooting strange ray-guns and trying to kill the both of them prove otherwise.  <br /> <br />As a failed leader of a revolution, James is the sole survivor of planetary genocide.  He has traveled three hundred years into the past to change his own future.  However, James was followed; alone except for Annie he is no more than an escaped convict as well as still a slave.  <br /> <br />Annie is a surprise to James; she is angered about his plight, albeit nervous because he himself told her he has killed someone.  And yet, she still helps him.  But when operatives of the Bureau continually threaten her life, and only his surrender can possibly guarantee her safety, Annie refuses to let him.  <br /> <br />If there is one book you should read this year, it is NEVER LOVE A STRANGER.  I actually read this in an electronic format and I'm SO glad its come out as a paperback...this story is worth the small press price as a paperback.  You won't be disappointed!  <br /> <br />This is an action adventure with a good dose of science fiction that starts out in the present, and takes you to the future, except, which one?  NEVER LOVE A STRANGER has some amazing twists that I hadn't nor could have predicted and literally blew my mind. <br /> <br />As for Annie and James.  WOW.  Ms Fisher has done a phenomenal job writing Annie's reactions to what gets thrown at her.  My heart accelerated, and I found myself sitting on the edge of my seat trying to read faster every time the Bureau started shooting at them.  Then, when Annie travels to the future with James simply because she couldn't let him die (he had been nothing but chivalrous towards her) I couldn't help but cheer her on. <br /> <br />NEVER LOVE A STRANGER is an amazing story full of sexual tension, a widerange of emotions and so many surprises -- I recommend it wholeheartedly!	2005-10-13

Thanks to Dr. Ken Thompson's work, we have the standard 5-piece (also some of other simple) endgame database. Based on Dr. Thompson's database, Dr. John Nunn prepared a 3-volumn book-set that covers \\"almost all\\" 5-piece endings. Rook and Pawn versus Rook is the first of the set. Using the symmetric property, they are able to cut the workload to 25%. By writing from the white's point-of-view, who has material advantage, the work is cut by half; then by mirroring the Q-side and K-side, only work for the P on the Q-side is sufficient (another 50% reduction). The final positions are: a) white can promote the P (win), b) white wins black R (win), c) black can eliminate white P (draw) (and force trading R's.) The study starts with the P on the 7th rank to see if it's a win or draw. Then the P retreats one step to 6th rank, and continues all the way to 2nd rank. <br />A few years ago, I know only one R and P ending (Lucena position) and about four general rules: <br />1) Rook on the seventh is worth one (or even two) P-sacrifice. <br />2) Active Rook is important in the endgame. <br />3) The side with material advantage has \\"more\\" chance to win if he can cuts off the defending K. <br />4) The defender should get his K in front of the P; otherwise he has \\"less\\" chance to draw. <br />\\"More or less\\" are relative terms here. In this book, Dr. Nunn provides the \\"absolute truth\\" about this type of endings. <br />His work in this book is outstanding (5 stars). I wonders who could remember most of the analysis he gives in the book. He mentions that even Kasparov might have trouble to play this with such precision. So, how practical is the book? I don't see how the average players can see the practicality of this book (I can't), except for the practical tips Nunn gives at the end of every section. That's a good place to start. If we want simpler study, then Averbakh's Essential Chess Endings is another good start. My C- and B-players don't care much for simple endings; they like toplay with pieces. This is where I have a little edge on them. The analysis from Nunn's ending set provides a good means for post-mortem discussion. <br />	2005-10-13

The big advantage of this chapter in their fictional lives over previous ones is that Agatha Christie does not have them embroiled in a rather weak political/spy drama, naive politics always being a flaw in her writing.  This is actually one of better of Christie's mysteries with many wonderfully dark ideas throughout that provide more fun than the usual stock amount of red herrings.  This book effectively combines the dark deeds of the author's later books with the sense of fun of the earlier ones which can sometimes be lacking in the later Christies.	2005-10-13

But he seems wholly unaware of how his view totally shapes his reading and critic of the great minds.<br /><br />For example, Plato suggests a society run by the elite who have been schooled in the correct management of a state. This, of course, is a very logical proposition. Durant finds many things to criticize with Plato's proposed society, but seems blissfully ignorant of that the power in Plato's society would reside within university walls since the one who shapes the training of our leaders holds as much power as the leaders themselves...but in fairness, I wouldn't expect someone who comes from the institution to critize a system that would give more power to people like himself.<br /><br />This may seem like a minor critic, and I guess it is, but Durant's book is full of such elitist and academic assumptions. So when combined with page after page of such assumptions and bias, it gets harder and harder to glean fact from his elitist opinions.<br /><br />After reading this book I get the sense that this author hasn't been shaped by the day-to-day performance of real work in the real world, but rather lives in his ivory tower where eloquent speech and high ideals take precedence over \\"mundane\\" things like the raising of a family and the struggle of the working class.<br /><br />Finally, Durant seems to revel in anti-Christian assumptions. He fails to give real criticism of some of the horrendous morals promoted by early philosophers (for example, a passing nod to the sanctity of life and the abhorrence of infanticide would have been nice). And his jumping from Aristotle to Francis Bacon seems to be his way of sticking his nose up to great Christian philosophers like Augustine, who, although a theologian, wrote great and influential treatises on subjects like time, truth, and free will. The Greek philosophers' writings were about God and the ultimate reality as well...so why are they included while great Christian thinkers are not?

Working through the exercises in the book has helped me more then I could have imagined! You have to do the work sheets. It is not a book to just skim through. As a result my goals are more streamline and priorites adjusted and as a result I get out of work earlier. I was spending time doings tasks that I felt were important but in reality were not. I just bought two more for my partners. Note I beleive this is very helpful for women, in particular, who spread themselves too thin and do too much multi-tasking. Women see all the little things at work that need done, do not necessarily delegate, and do those little things that others may not even notice. All of which in the end only waste time.

He explains the most important Egyptian philosophical concept \\"ma'at\\" or \\"connective justice\\" (illustrated in \\"The Eloquent Peasant\\" a Middle Kingdom work but holding \\"for Egyptian civilization in general\\" in terms of the ideas of both Karl Marx and Nietzsche.<br />  Most importantly he shows what the Egyptian state really stood for as opposed to the false images found in Old Testament propaganda that mispresents Eqypt as an oppressive slave state. \\"The Egyptian state.\\" he says, \\"is the implementation of a legal order that precludes the natural supremacy of the strong and opens up prospects for the weak (the 'widows' and 'orphans') that otherwise would not exist.\\"<br />  Unlike many who think that the revolution initiated by Akhenaten perished with him, Assmann presents evidence that its main principles survived in other religious traditions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) as well in secular venues from Greek philosophy \\"to the universalist formulas of oun own age as embodied in the physics of Einstein and Heisenberg.\\"<br />It is possible that many of the ideas of \\"Christianity\\" were originally formulated by the Egyptians.<br />  Today we know more about the Ancient Egyptians than ever before so we should \\"attempt to enter into a dialogue with the newly readable messages of ancient Egyptian culture and thus to reestablish them as an integral part of our cultural memory.\\"<br />I have only skimmed the surface of this important book.

I bought it willingly enough, but after about a quarter of the way through I began skipping the chapters about Roran and only reading the sections about Eragon and Saphira. I never have read the entire thing, but I did find some parts of Eldest just as good as Eragon. Too bad no one told Paolini to rip out the pointless and boring sections of this book. It would probably cut it down almost a hundred pages and make it easier to get through the book.<br /><br />Despite the difficulty I had plowing my way through the middle of the story, I enjoyed the last maybe thirty pages.

US	52601510	RDTYDSHUF884Q	1400042364	523547957	The Roads to Modernity: The British, French, and American Enlightenments	Books	1	19	39	N	N	A TEMPEST IN A TEAPOT	Try as I might, I was barely able to finish reading this book without a rising feeling of exasperation, not to say ennui, on several levels.   <br /> <br />I can agree with the author's thesis that the Enlightenment originated not so much in France as it did in Britain, with the French and American experiences \\"serving as foils for the British\\" (pg. 20).  As a non-historian, I can't say whether she is making a significant statement.  After all, most non-academic people would probably think of the \\"Renaissance\\" as an Italian phenomenon, but would have no problem if someone suddenly \\"proved\\" that in fact Italy was only one of several countries in which the Renaissance took root and developed.  It all seems to me so much a tempest in a teapot.    <br /> <br />But it was Himmelfarb's turgid prose and style that gave me the most headaches.  On page x of the Preface, the author calls her 284-page book a \\"short book\\".  At 284 pages, a Dicken's novel might well be considered short, but by page 22 in this book, that is, by the end of the Preface and the Prologue, Himmelfarb had really said all she had to say on her subject.  The rest seemed to me to be so much over-icing on a cake.  The book isn't \\"short\\": it's 242 pages too *long*. <br /> <br />I first became discouraged when on inspecting the book, I found that it contained not only a Preface, but also a Prologue and an Epilogue. This may seem a mean-spirited thing to criticize, I suppose, but still, a book that needs so much explanation before the author gets to the heart of the matter and that needs a 10 page commentary beyond its ending, leaves me a  little disconcerted.   <br /> <br />By all accounts I have read, Professor Himmelfarb is one of the paragons of contemporary debate on the American intellectual arena.  I'm sure the accolades are well deserved.  Still,  when an author informs me in the Prologue to her work that she is going to \\"reclaim\\" a subject and then that she is going to \\"redefine\\" (twice) and \\"restore\\" (thrice) it,  that she is \\"unapologetic and unironic\\" of her approach and that she is \\"engaged in a doubly revisionist exercise\\" (pg 6),  then it seems to me she portrays a combative demeanor off-putting to the general public (like me). <br /> <br />After all, it's usually reviewers, readers and the posterity of a book that proclaim and establish a book as \\"revisionist\\" or declare that an author has redefined or reclaimed a certain field of study.  For an author to do so, seems to me, is somewhat indelicate. <br /> <br />I could \\"forgive\\" all of this, I imagine, were it not for the turgid, repetitious and frankly, pretentious prose in which the book is written.  On page 16, for example, in the first paragraph, we are treated to a veritable bestiary of 17 Enlightenment illuminati in such quick succession that the point of the paragraph is totally lost. The feeling one is left with after plodding through this absurd presentation is that the author wants to impress the reader with the fact that she is very familiar with all these notables, and you better be too.  Something like that.  On pages 11-12, a mini-dissertation on the etymology of the word \\"Enlightenment\\" is given.  This is interesting but unnecessary.  The book is notable for this type of thing:  inflated and beside the point stances and wordy explanations that lose the reader, at least this reader. <br /> <br />The book ends with an Epilogue, as I said.  The first sentence in this chapter reads: \\"In America today, the Enlightenment is alive and well.\\"  Really?  I thought a \\"culture war\\" has been going on in America for the last 3 decades, in which the Enlightenment is fighting for its survival and not doing well at all.  George Washington's Farewell Address may be read annually in the US Senate, as Himmelfarb goes on to say, but that's about the only place it is read, certainly not without denouncing speeches, threatened lawsuits, anti-Farewell Address marches and so on taking place trying to *prevent* thespeech from being given.  <br /> <br />I have never read any other book by the acclaimed author, but I will do so now.  It just can't be that her other books resemble this one in any important way. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

If you are interested in learning a language, then this should probably be on your reading list. <br /> <br />Barry Farber provides some important suggestions that can assist the beginning language student. His most useful suggestion (from my perspective) is the idea of snatching spare moments of time to use for foreign language study. Farber provides sound advice about learning grammar, absorbing vocabulary, and practicing a new language with native speakers. His book got me turned on to the Pimsleur tapes, which have helped me in my Japanese language studies. <br /> <br />On the downside, Farber's book is very Euro-centric. He gives passing mention to Chinese, Japanese, and Indonesian; but his focus is the European languages that were traditional favorites before the rise of Asia as an economic power. The information in the book is also somewhat dated--although this is not a serious flaw to its usefulness. <br /> <br />-Graham E. Fuller's book, \\"How to Learn a Foreign Language\\" provides the same amount of technical advice about languages, although Fuller's book lacks many of the anecdotes which give Farber's book a certain panache.  <br /> <br />-A.G. Hawke's book \\"The Quick and Dirty Guide to Learning Languages Fast\\" is good for pragmatists--but it lacks Farber's advice about grammar. It is, though--true to its name--a good book for those who need to get survival skills in a new language in a short period of time. <br /> <br />-Edward Trimnell's \\"Why You Need a Foreign Language & How to Learn One\\" gives good advice about languages in the business world, and about the same amount of detail on the technical aspects of learning a language. He also gives extensive coverage of the Asian language scene.	2005-10-13

While this was indeed the subject, the task of the course was more in line with what this text deals with - at the end of that course, we had to construct (as best we could) a consistent theology that dealt with the primary areas of theological concern.<br /><br />The editors Serene Jones and Paul Lakeland have divided this text into six major sections, dealing with the key areas of theological concern:  God; Human Being; Sin and Evil; Jesus Christ; Church; and Spirit.  The editors have made efforts to make a text useful to a diverse and somewhat paradoxical community situation - how does one honour the traditions while recognising innovation and individuality in the current theological scene?  How does one do theology for long-established communities, newly formed community, and those who seek a more personal theological development?<br /><br />In each section, the editors begin some quotes or stories, vignettes that show everyday applications of the issues - how people think about a particular idea, or what they do to bring their beliefs into practice.  They continue then with a 'State of the Question', which is a brief statement of introduction to the topic, highlighting salient points and areas of controversy.  Following this, the 'map' of the chapters proceed in two broad ways - a historical theological treatment and a contemporary theological treatment.  It is this latter part that is the longest section of each chapter, dealing with modern ideas from current theologians dealing with the issues in context of modern/post-modern culture, scientific knowledge, political realities, and more.  Throughout the text, there are bracketed sections (set off in different indentation and typeface) that are drawn from primary sources or set aside special questions that show a difference with the main progress of the chapter.<br /><br />This is very much a collaborative piece.  In addition to Jones and Lakeland as the overall editors, each primary chapter has its own editor, and each chapter is a synthesis of the writing and views of half a dozen or more theologians.  They are not presented in dialog form or in the form of separate essays, but rather in a more integrated way, which has both strengths and weaknesses.  This is true of the overall organisation of the book as well.  Jones and Lakeland address their reasoning for the way in which they have selected the categories: 'The answer is pragmatic.  Since our students know so little about the history of Christian theology and have limited training in the tradition, this pattern seemed best suited to teaching \\"the basics.\\" '  This is a book specifically designed to be used as and useful as a textbook for introductory theology.  In an era where an increasing number of seminary students are second- or third-career students who have had little or no history and philosophy training (much less theology training), this kind of approach is very welcome.<br /><br />The tradition behind this book includes the books 'Christian Theology' and 'Readings in Christian Theology', each by Peter Hodgson and others. (both of which I read in my seminary days) as well as 'Reconstructing Christian Theology' by Rebecca Chopp et al. (which I read on my own).  The first two books were done in the early 1980s, while Chopp's book was done in the 1990s, recognising shifts in the 'typical' students who enrolled in seminary.  Jones and Lakeland are again responding to a shift in the past ten years, one that has seen shifts not only in social location but educational purpose.<br /><br />One of the features of this text is the inclusion of a CD-ROM that has a lot of extra material, and links to a broader system through the Logos Library System.  At the time of this review, only PC format is supported, but an insert in the back of the book promises Macintosh capability soon.

Jones as a Protestant and Lakeland as a Roman Catholic have worked together to make this a volume useful for readers from both traditions.<br /><br />The next time I teach theology, I will definitely use this text.the Mac application).

First of all, I was forced to pick a star rating for this when it shouldnt recieve any. This book is a horrible thing to put in the hands of child. This book is supposed to have been based on the life of an actual person??? Anybody who would consider buying this book must not care about influencing their children with negative behavior, negative feelings and only prefer them to forcibly and completely understand the meaning of no, picking out their faults and how most to come down on children wrecking thier self esteem, rather than praise them and show them alternative choices. This book is about nothing but a  bratty pain in the butt kid who does nothing but get in trouble and cause problems. Its crap. I dont think he's funny at all and I actually find him disturbing. It seems to me, David is ADHD, or needs to be in a special programs class. He hurts peoples feelings, is rude and disrespectful, destroys things, does things that are totally gross, and is never told how to correct his behavior. Sure he does his punishment at the end of the book, but then, is never made to aplogize for anything he did.  The only positive page is when the last page says \\"good job\\" I prefer to read positive, uplifting, nice, educatonal books to my children. He grosses people out, has no manners, and is a discipline nightmare. And I certainly wouldnt be proud to write about it if it were my child, or if it was myself portrayed as a child. I wouldnt be happy if a kid like this was in my son's class(and definitely wouldnt be laughing about it since kids of this nature take time away from the kids who actually want to learn) and certaily wouldnt be proud and laughing if it were my child who was acting this way.  We recieved this book as a gift for our son, and like other children, sure he has gotton in trouble at school. He is in kindegarten and he was hanging out with the troublemaker (the real David) and they both got in trouble. This was his only time getting in trouble. He has since steered clear of him and has had no problems. He recieved this book about three weeks after getting in trouble and he was crushed, like he should constantly be reminded he got in trouble. He absolutely hated it and the thought the pictures were ugly and even my three year old daughter said \\"those pictures are freaking me out.\\" Unfortuneatley it was written in when we recieved it and now cannot return or exhcange it which is disappointing since its going to end up in the trash since I dont want it ending up in the hands of any other children. After reading it through once, I was appalled at the amount of negativity, and my husband said the only place that book should be is in the fireplace, and he was amazed any sane, loving, caring, person would buy this self esteem stripping negative book for a child. I have seen another one in the series and it too, is nothign but negative. These little minds we read to are SO impressionable. So if you are so inclined to introduce your children to how to do everything absolutely wrong,  get picked on all the time about doing wrong things, and then never have to aplogize for thier behavior, then by all means buy the book. All this says is people think its funny that this kid acts this way, then we have a bunch of little kids acting this way with them thinking its funny when in the real world doesnt think so. And only have to do one small task to make up for a whole day or week of acting like a undisciplined primate. And any parent who gets this book, who may have a kid who acts this way, may feel its a personal stab at them, along with the child thinking bad about himself as well. One page of telling a kid \\"good job\\" doesnt stick in the mind of a child. Pages and pages of wrong and people laughing about it thinkig its funny, will. So if you truly care about your children, and prefer them to grow up praised and loved and with a feeling of security and them feeling they doing the right things, rather than continually pointing out the wrong things, then dont buy it. Its a waste of money when you could be buying something so much more uplifting and postitve and certainly more educational. There are hundreds of thousands of childrens books out there. Pass this up because Im sure there is something much better for your children to be filing away in their litlte minds.	2005-10-13

It seemed like the author was attacking me, and I in turn had some negative thoughts about HIS faith, because that's what we do. It took taking a step back and considering what real ministry is, the act of serving, and when I stopped doing what he was pointing out that I was doing, I could actually see the beauty. <br /> <br />    There is so much truth, and it comes out of so much tough experience, and it helped to confirm a lot of the theories I have also had about the Christian music scene from my own church concert experiences. It was awesome to see someone else publish statements that so closely mirrored my sentiments, and now I am passing around my copy among members of the band I am in so we can discuss it, as though he were our new mentor and it was a job shadow for Christian Rock and what NOT to do. Very valuable insights.	2005-10-13

I found this to be a pointless endeavor. A good theme should provide cohesion or make the subject more approachable. Conceiving of both a single-celled organism and a culture as complex adaptive systems, however, provides little insight into the functioning of either and serves mostly to drive home the point that the notion of a complex adaptive system is so broad that nearly anything worth discussing falls under that heading. <br /> <br />Quantum physics is discussed at length. Unfortunately this section reads more like a catalog of concepts and discoveries than like a good introduction conveying key concepts. Other subjects (biology, evolution, ecosystems, computer learning, economics, public policy) are covered too superficially to yield anything of interest. <br /> <br />The major arguments of _The Quark and the Jaguar_ are as follows: <br /> <br />1) Effective complexity is not the same as algorithmic complexity. Algorithmic complexity is 0 for uniform data and highest for completely random data. (Potential) effective complexity is highest in the middle, where patterns and rules (schema) can be derived and minimal for both uniform data and random data. <br /> <br />2) Classical physics implies a deterministic world. How can anything interesting happen? Because quantum physics offers randomness. <br /> <br />3) Complex adaptive systems create schemas to model the data. This is true for the formation of life, to children learning to speak, to scientific progress, etc. Successful complex adaptive systems are solutions to problems. So the biological and cultural diversity on the planet represents a huge amount of valuable information. <br /> <br />4) We should preserve biological and cultural diversity so we don't lose valuable information.	2005-10-13

This is a story that is different in several ways from most of the Harlequins I have read.  Firstly Sara is several (it doesn't say exactly how many) years older than Matt, her eventual husband.  The book begins with her daughter driving off to her honeymoon.<br /><br />Sara has a few days to spare before she has to work again and winds up spending them with a total stranger that she instantly clicks with, Matt. And while I can't say it isn't sexual, at this point I am really impressed with the author's ability to attempt and build an authentic relationship between the two of them.  One that has to stand the trials of their imprompteu marriage that covers the other half of the book.<br /><br />Ultimately Sara is the better drawn of the two characters but Matt isn't entirely a cookie cutter, and the supporting characters are great, there is a real sense of community in this book.  I will have to hunt down the second book about Amber, Sara's daughter, and hopefully more about Matt and Sara is in that one.	2005-10-13

He doesn't get much in action page time in this book.  I missed seeing Samantha and David's romance developing.  Instead what I got was Samantha obsessing over her hair and whether she's going to do David at Camp David.  What about the love?

Craig finds in this rejection more than doubt based upon absence of Biblical or Logical support, but an attempt by a Foreign Power (Papacy) to dominate Germany on the eve of Unification via the War of 1871-72.  With no discussion of the reaction to the doctrine elsewhere, it is unclear if Germans took the matter seriously while other countries with substantial Catholic populations simply accepted the decree or thought it too silly to think about. <br /> <br />The discussion of the Thirty Years War in Germany and the concerted policy by major European countries that Germany  remain a collection of minor states to avoid German domination of the Continent are worth reading.  The causes, life in and during and effects of WW I are hardly touched upon. <br />The enormous damage done to Europe by US foreign policy under Wilson is not mentioned, nor is the generalized fiction about Germany in the US and UK during this period.  A hint at the origins of modern Anti-Semitism is provided by a discussion of a handfull of Jewish swindlers leading to the Panic (Depression) of 1873. The role of war reperations from France due to the 72-73 victory by Prussia/Germany is discussed.  A point worth thinking about, but whose validity is not backed-up. There is not a word concerning how rhe Depression of 1873 contributed to the cultural environment into which Hiter was born about 20 years later. Perhaps such influence can be neither proved or inferred.  Considering how until the 1950s at least Southern children grew up hearing stories of Great-Grandpa's fight with the Yankees an hundred years before, the depression's effect on Hitler as a child must have existed.  Craig is a bit more realistic about Jews in Germany than most so-called historians who paint a picture of virgins amongst bandits.  There is no meaningful discussion of Germany's purposes after the Weimar Republic. There is no discussion of the analyses, especially Spengler's, of the struggle to preserve European (including American) civilization. The fiction that the UK and France attacked Germany in 1939 to answer aggression in Europe is not given the lie to. (Russia had attacked and annexed parts of Finland earlier during the 1930s.) There is hardly any discussion of the Hitler period.  As there are no worthwhile histories of the period in English, it is probably as well.  The horrors visited upon the Germans by Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill are hardly mentioned.  The hostility, even hatred that many present-day Germans have for at least elements of US troops on German soil is unmentioned.   <br /> <br />The one chapter in the book I found most disappointing is entitled \\"The Professors.\\" What I found most lacking is the origins of the German mindset, which Bertrand Russell claimed was shared by Jews who fled Hitler, and he characterized as abstract and complex instead of the British mindset which Russell thought more immediate, practical and simple.  The German invention of history as science in the 19th century is hinted upon.  The subject's regression into nonsense, propaganda and moralisms goes unlamented. <br /> <br />\\"The Germans\\" is a fun book to read.  It presents few challanges aside from a few untranslated quotations.  It sheds a bit of light.	2005-10-13

This book also contains some of the puzzles that have stumped the world's smartest mathematicians.<br /><br />The author, Johnny Ball introduces concepts to make math more fun and very easy to understand. Part of what makes this book quite enjoyable is the full-color pages filled with diagrams, pictures and explanations. The concepts are divided into four main chapters:<br /><br />Where do Numbers come from?<br />Magic Numbers<br />Shaping Up<br />The World of Math<br /><br />Children will learn about Roman numerals, infinity, secret codes, World News, how counting began, shapes, chaos and logic. Johnny Ball also answers the following questions:<br /><br />Did Cavemen Count?<br />How many molecules are in one glass of water?<br />What do the symbols on a Babylonian clay token mean?<br />How did the Mayans count?<br />How do insects use prime timing to survive?<br /><br />How did numbers evolve? See Indian numbers go from 10 symbols to what they are today. One was originally a horizontal line. Three, three horizontal lines. Which really helps to explain why three looks the way it does today. Really fascinating stuff even for adults to read about.<br /><br />As someone who enjoyed writing words upside down on my calculator in school, I thoroughly enjoyed this entertaining book about how math evolved through time. There is even a page comparing 1-100 in Babylonian, Egyptian hieroglyphics, Chinese script, Hindu, Hebrew, Greek, Roman, Mayan and Modern Arabic.<br /><br />The Math quiz is fun and one example:<br /><br />\\"Find two numbers that multiply together to give 1,000,000 but neither of which contains any zeros.\\"<br /><br />You may need to buy some food for the lessons on page 72. \\"How can you cut a doughnut into 12 pieces with only 3 straight cuts?

US	43519458	R3AWBYBJ0SRKRJ	0801027977	973781768	Is the Reformation Over?: An Evangelical Assessment of Contemporary Roman Catholicism	Books	2	47	91	N	N	What Is The Cost of Unity?	This is actually the second part of a review I posted at my own web site. I trust it will still convey my thoughts on the book.<br /><br />I would like to preface my analysis by expressing that the authors displayed a clear bias throughout the book. Mark Noll is an evangelical, and I believe Carolyn Nystrom is as well, and in this book they spend a great deal of time expressing harsh criticism of evangelicalism. While I am Protestant and am perhaps being sensitive, it seems that they did not return the harsh rhetoric towards the Roman Catholic Church. We can see this bias displayed in the chapter discussing conversion from one tradition to another. In this section the authors provided several examples of evangelicals who converted to Catholicism, but no examples of conversion from Catholicism to Protestantism. This type of conversion is, in my experience, far more common and my church stands as an example. It is probably safe to say that our church is primarily composed of former Roman Catholics who left their church and then became believers. The bias is also clear in the chapter discussing ecumenical dialogues. The authors blame evangelicals for expressing anti-Catholic beliefs, but they provide no similar evidence for anti-Protestantism. They also provide no historical framework of persecution and Inquisition to show why Protestants expressed such distrust of the Catholic Church. Thus the reader needs to understand that this book expresses harsh attitudes towards Protestantism without corresponding harshness towards Roman Catholicism.<br /><br />Minimizing Theological Considerations<br /><br />Throughout the book the reader will note that the authors continually minimize theological considerations. Their overarching argument, as I expressed in the introduction to this review, is that the core disagreement between evangelicals and Roman Catholics is ecclesiology. This allows Noll and Nystrom to minimize theological disagreements as being of secondary importance. The authors' main strategy is not to thoroughly examine each point of doctrine where evangelicals disagree with Catholics (and sometimes vice versa), but to prove that issues over which Protestants often express concern are merely minor considerations in the larger area of the nature of the church. \\"In sum,\\" they say, \\"the central difference that continues to seperate evangelicals and Catholics is not Scripture, justification by faith, the pope, Mary, the sacraments or clerical celibacy - though the central difference is reflected in differences on these matters - but the nature of the church\\" (page 237). If the reader does not agree with that premise, he will likely not agree with most of the author's major conclusions.<br /><br />Issues Not Addressed<br /><br />It is clear that in a book of this size the authors cannot address every theological issue that seperates Protestant from Catholic. Yet there were at least two major disagreements that received no attention. The first of these is purgatory. The Catechism, which the authors often quote favorably, has this to say about purgatory: \\"All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven.\\" Needless to say, purgatory is a view that cannot be supported by a Protestant, biblical understanding of salvation. Purgatory calls into question the sufficiency of Jesus' suffering, for how effective was Christ's death if it needs to be supplemented by our own suffering? Did not Jesus die so that we did not need to suffer this type of torment?<br /><br />A second issue, and one that is perhaps even more important, has to do with the Eucharist. The authors deal in some depth with transubstatiation in which the bread and wine become the real presence of Christ. Yet this is not the most significant concern posed by the mass. Of far more importance is the understanding of the mass being a propitiation for sin. Protestants, having searched the Scriptures, believe that Christ's sacrifice was made once and had perfect, total efficacy. It does not need to be further supplemented or repeated in any way. Yet the Roman Catholic Church teaches that each celebration of the mass is a new, propitiatory sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />These two issues are of critical importance, for they call into question the efficacy of Christ's sacrifice. Despite this, the authors overlook them altogether.<br /><br />The Fundamentals<br /><br />Phil Johnson recently posted an article written by John MacArthur entitled \\"Essential Christianity, not 'Mere Christianity'.\\" This article discussed the fundamentals of Christianity. MacArthur summarizes a Protestant understanding of the difficulties involved in attaining ecumenical unity. \\"Certainly any list of fundamentals would have to begin with these doctrines Scripture explicitly identifies as nonnegotiable: the absolute authority of Scripture over tradition (sola Scriptura), justification by faith alone (sola fide), the deity of Christ, and the Trinity.\\" While Roman Catholics and Protestants are able to agree on some of these issues, such as the deity of Christ and the Trinity, there are others where a vast chasm remains (justification by faith alone and the absolute authority of Scripture over tradition).<br /><br />There are several places in the book where the authors examine these issues in general, and justification in particular, and declare that there is no longer any critical difference between the Catholic and Protestant understandings of these pivotal issues. \\"If it is true, as once was repeated frequently by Protestants conscious of their anchorage in Martin Luther or John Calvin that iustificatio articulus stantis vel cadentis ecclesiae (justification is the article on which the church stands or falls), then the Reformation is over\\" (page 232). Time and space fail me to provide a detailed apologetic for the Protestant understanding of justification, but suffice it to say that the authors do nothing - absolutely nothing - to prove that an informed understanding of the biblical view of justification is now shared between Protestant and Catholic. In fact, the discerning reader will wonder whether the authors even truly understand the Protestant view of justification. Clever wording and ambiguous statements in ecumenical dialogue does not constitute change within the Catholic Church. Perhaps a repeal of the anathemas of the Council of Trent, anathemas which were affirmed at Vatican II, would prove that change had occured. But as it stands in official Roman Catholic statements of theology, the crucial differences remain.<br /><br />What of Scripture?<br /><br />Conspicuous by its absence is any real examination of Catholic or Protestant theology in light of the Scripture. There are very few quotes from the Bible and certainly very few attempts to examine either system of doctrine through the Bible. Page 248 finds the authors defending Catholicism by showing that the traditional complaints against Catholicism now exist in Protestantism. But what of Scripture, our guide? Writing, as they are, for a Protestant audience, it seems that proving all things from Scripture would advance their argument. Yet, it appears, they are unable to do so. We see this also in the discussion of justification. \\"The Roman Catholic Church now [post-Vatican II] articulates positions on salvation - even on justification by faith - that are closer to the main teachings of the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation than are the beliefs of many Protestants, indeed, of many evangelical Protestants. Strange as it may seem to put it this way, the ECT documents present what can only be called a classically orthodox depiction of Christian salvation, primarily because they empahsize and build upon these official Catholic teachings\\" (page 180). But again, what of Scripture?

Sproul's \\"Getting the Gospel Right,\\" a thorough examination of the issues surrounding the gospel and ecumenism.fail me to provide a detailed apologetic for the Protestant understanding of justification, but suffice it to say that the authors do nothing - absolutely nothing - to prove that an informed understanding of the biblical view of justification is now shared between Protestant and Catholic. In fact, the discerning reader will wonder whether the authors even truly understand the Protestant view of justification. Clever wording and ambiguous statements in ecumenical dialogue does not constitute change within the Catholic Church. Perhaps a repeal of the anathemas of the Council of Trent, anathemas which were affirmed at Vatican II, would prove that change had occured. But as it stands in official Roman Catholic statements of theology, the crucial differences remain. <br /> <br />What of Scripture? <br /> <br />Conspicuous by its absence is any real examination of Catholic or Protestant theology in light of the Scripture. There are very few quotes from the Bible and certainly very few attempts to examine either system of doctrine through the Bible. Page 248 finds the authors defending Catholicism by showing that the traditional complaints against Catholicism now exist in Protestantism. But what of Scripture, our guide? Writing, as they are, for a Protestant audience, it seems that proving all things from Scripture would advance their argument. Yet, it appears, they are unable to do so. We see this also in the discussion of justification. \\"The Roman Catholic Church now [post-Vatican II] articulates positions on salvation - even on justification by faith - that are closer to the main teachings of the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation than are the beliefs of many Protestants, indeed, of many evangelical Protestants. Strange as it may seem to put it this way, the ECT documents present what can only be called a classically orthodox depiction of Christian salvation, primarily because they empahsize and build upon these official Catholic teachings\\" (page 180). But again,what of Scripture? Should we not allow Scripture to be our guide as we examine these issues? <br /> <br />The Arguments <br /> <br />The endorsements for this book would lead the reader to believe that it represents a high level of scholarship.

US	12076918	R3QII7ACY5KC1P	0395979021	979215737	The Circuit	Books	5	8	8	N	N	The Circuit	The Circuit, one of my favorite books, is written by Francisco Jimenez. The Circuit is about a family that lived in El Rancho Blanco, Guadalajara. Francisco and his family moved to the United States crossing the border illegally. When they get to the United States in California they look for work and they work in the fields picking cotton. Francisco's family is always hiding from the border patrol which they call it \\"la migra.\\" As they go on they move to different places. The reason I read this story is because it held my interest , because I wondered how it would be crossing the border illegally. Also, because some of the story reminds me about when I got here from Mexico.  I really recommend this book.  It's exciting and it taught me to eat all my food and not throw it away because Francisco's family did't have anything to eat sometimes. I would give this book a ten, and I really loved it a lot and I think you should try it.	2005-10-13

And yet it never seems confined. I have not seen this episode on TV, so it may have been different to watch as it never changed location, but when reading it things flowed very well. Once again the Doctor has to save the world, this time with the help of Leela. The story takes place in the early 1900's and the newly invented electric generator plays a central part.    Don't expect a lot of character development, which is typical for these novelizations. Do expect lots of action. A quick fun read. Enjoy!	2005-10-13

I re-read it occasionally, and I understand more each time. One of Miles Stanford's emphases was the uniqueness of Paul's writings. Paul not only taught that salvation was by faith in the Son of God, but also that our Christian lives must be lived by faith in the Son of God. \\"I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.\\" Put those other Christian books aside, and read this one!	2005-10-13

It provides a comprehensive analysis of the health risks posed by the new artificial sweetener Splenda. And while it is very informative, the facts are often conveyed through personal narrative, making it a thoroughly enjoyable read. She gives practical, real-world suggestions on how to avoid Splenda and other dangerous chemical sweeteners. Healthier, more natural alternatives are suggested as part of a balanced nutritional regimen. I very much appreciated the earnest tone of the writing as well. Dr.Hull conveys a sincere concern for the health of her readers and never sensationalizes the dangers of Splenda and similar chemical sweeteners. <br /> <br />If you find ever find yourself seeking out Sugar-Free and/or Diet items at the grocery store, then this book is an absolute MUST.	2005-10-13

As Copernicus shook the medieval mindset with his pronouncement that the earth revolves around the sun, we are now to consider that our local sun and its solar system revolves around its binary companion!  Most importantly, as the author asserts, this celestial motion is considered responsible for the cycles or \\"cosmic seasons\\" that drives the waxing and waning of human civilization.      The reader is introduced to Copernicus' 3rd motion of the earth - \\"Precession of the Equinoxes\\" in a most profound and fascinating manner. \\"Precession\\" is not a new knowledge, just as the heliocentric model was ancient in origin, what is new is the author's binary star theory to account for this phenomenon in the light of modern astronomy.  The reader's mind is expanded beyond its pedestrian world to re-discover the grand cycles of the cosmos that was known to the ancient cultures.      \\"Lost Star\\" holds ones interest like a detective story as each new piece of evidence whets the reader's appetite for the next shard. The author engages the reader in solving no less than a cosmic mystery story.  The prize is nothing less the reconciliation of an ancient sacred science with today's understanding of a materialistic-based science.     The author cites a variety of excellent sources, a notable one,  \\"Hamlet's Mill\\" which was a seminal work by Giorgio de Santillana, professor of the history and philosophy of science at M.I.T. and Hertha von Dechend, professor of the history of science at the University of Frankfurt, which explored the encoding of precise astronomical knowledge into the worldwide myths and folklore. Typically, although this was written in the 1970's, mainstream academia has given little attention to this fact, as few people want to upset the status quo.      Mr. Cruttenden's breadth of intellectual curiosity culls from the ancient traditions of India to the most cutting edge think tanks of astrophysics.   His cross-disciplinary approach adds considerable fortitude to his thesis as he explores the phenomenon of \\"Precession\\" in the light of ancient mythology, archeology, and astrophysics.     The enigmas of archeology with its many \\"out-of-place\\" artifacts fall squarely into place should we tentatively accept the thesis of this book - the rise & fall of civilizations is a product of a grand cosmic cycle that was intimately known in the far distant past.   How could the ancients have known so much without the aid of our current technology? As the author suggests, perhaps there have been cultures so advanced as to use the rarified technologies of the mind and spirit in a time more conducive to the full development of those subtle qualities. Which brings to my mind, was this what Plato was referring to when discussing the possibility of attaining absolute knowledge via a \\"Science of First Causes?\\"  Contrast this a-priori (before-fact) or \\"consciousness-based\\" science with our current \\"trial and error,\\" a-posteriori (after-the-fact) science and I am reminded of Arthur C. Clarke's quote, \\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\\"      Prior to the rise of our western view of linear history the ancients' perspective of human history was a cyclical one.  Plato expounds this view in his famous dialogues in an attempt to recapture a long lost Golden Age.  The are many anomalies in the currently held view of linear history. These \\"exceptions\\" to the established paradigm continue to mount almost daily with new archeological discoveries worldwide, which the author aptly notes.  My own personal experience is that a cursory study of western art history reveals the flawed assumptions of a linear historical model.  Art students are immediately introduced to the mature art of the first dynastic periods of ancient Egypt only to see it's gradual decay over the next 3 millennia, not to mention the fact the we cannot duplicate the engineering feats of the great pyramids that have blocks fitted to ultrasonic precision.    I urge anyone sincerely interested in the whence, whither and why of humanity's origins to read this book.	2005-10-13

Finally, after several decades of how-to books on voluntary simplicity, we are beginning to see some studies of the phenomenon. (I hesitate to call it a movement, it doesn't seem quite that organized.) This book and Mary Grigsby's Buying Time and Getting By are an excellent start to what promises to be a very interesting genre.<br /><br />There are some provocative ideas in these essays. For instance, Robert Frank believes we should tax consumption in order to encourage saving. When is the last time you heard anyone encourage saving? Our leaders and financial advisors encourage us to invest and spend, and if the investments we make don't pan out (Enron, Worldcom), well, we knew the risks. Anyone who saves these days, with interest rates near zero, is considered a chump. Yet, at the same time we are supposed to accept the risks of investing and being responsible for our own retirements, some want to dismantle the Social Security System that provides a modest safety net just in case things don't work out.<br /><br />Edward Luttwak in his essay notes that America embraces all the beliefs of Puritanism, even Calvinism, except for one. We value hard work, self-sufficiency, and responsibility. We condemn over-indulgence of all kinds. And yet, we don't value frugality, the most important virtue of our forefathers. We accept as given that the economy must grow, that we must always increase our consumption and aspire to bigger and more expensive things. As David G. Myers points out in his essay, more doesn't make us happier.<br /><br />This volume covers the theory of voluntary simplicity with essays by Amitai Etzioni, Abraham Maslow, Myers, Luttwak, Juliet Schor, and Robert Frank. It explores the history of voluntary simplicity in essays by David Shi, Charles Wagner, Richard B. Gregg, and Duane Elgin. Anti-simplifiers are represented by a typically smirky essay by David Brooks and a typically confused essay by James Twitchell, who embraces consumerism while simultaneously loathing himself for it.<br /><br />A theme that runs through many of these essays is that everyone should adopt voluntary simplicity. It seems obvious that the world would be better if everyone reduced consumption, recycled, and considered quality of life over quantity of things. But one thing I like about voluntary simplicity is that it is anarchic in a way. There are no real leaders, and you can practice simple living as much or as little as you like and adapt it to your own circumstances: in a city or in the sticks, as a family or individual or as a community.<br /><br />Voluntary Simplicity: Responding to Consumer Culture is a thought-provoking collection, for those familiar with simple living and those who are new to the idea.neously loathing himself for it.  <br /> <br />A theme that runs through many of these essays is that everyone should adopt voluntary simplicity.

It's beginning was slow, and I was sort of irritated with Ann(oops, sorry, Anne)for chatting so much. But as the story started to get faster and you got to know the characters a little better, I couldn't help but loving her! It was rather funny, too. Anne was always getting herself into scrapes, but she was so well-meaning. The characters are so delightfully different from each other, but they all bind together to make for one good read. The ending was also good, although I didn't like the fact that Anne was grown up. It's one of those endings that leaves you satisfied, but begging for more, if you know what I mean. I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series....but somehow, I can't believe, try as I do, that the others could be half as beautiful. I hardly ever cry over books, and yet this one opened my heart. Anne leaves us with these touching, parting words....\\"God's in his heaven, all is well.\\"	2005-10-13

At times you'll notice Kurt's all excited about his demos,and finding a rare guitar and such.<br />Other times,he will have suicidal urges and seem very upset.The rest of the times he seems like just Kurt,very odd and almost delusional and on drugs.<br /><br />This book will take you from the days of \\"Bleach\\"(Nirvana's first album),all the way to the end past his final album<br />\\"In-Utero\\"(Nirvana's third studio album).It will make you feel sick to your stomache when you read his gross and twisted thoughts.On ocassion you'll be laughing so hard and almost forget you are rerading a book,because you really are not this book is Kurt's mind and you are looking into it.<br /><br />Kurt apperently likes lists and lots of them.He will list some of his favorite bands,and some of the track lsitings he would like on his albums and such.There is alot of rough drafts of songs that are now some of our biggest rock anthoms.Early lyrics to Kurt's biggest song \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", are even in here.On some songs you'll see a unfamiliar song name ,but you swear you know the lyrics from somewhere since they are earlier versions of big songs.(Imodium/Breed)<br /><br />Kurt is an amazing artist from his sketches to his crafty ideas for music videos,and all these are in this book.One of the first few pages you'll see a skelaton with long hair and think of it as alittle disturbing,but to some unique.He even draws little hand symbols to show how close he came.There is also some crazy comic strips that are really well drawn and pretty funny.Like the comic with the macho redneck.<br /><br />This book is chronological obviously,since you would'nt enjoy the fact of skipping year after year and be way off track.Though you could skip a fairly large part of the book and still be in the 80's journal entries.Kurt eaither wrote more in the 80's or they  found less entries in the 90's.(Keep in mind though he died in 1994)<br /><br />The pages look battered and weathered and stained.The hand writting looks sloppy and usually in ink and the early letters to friends are no exception.This is not some false info hashed together about a famouse dead guy for a fast buck,this is a persons personal belonging not intended to be read and will be anyways.<br /><br />I highly recomend you to purchase this book.If you like Nirvana,if you idolize Kurt Cobain,if you just like a good unusual book,BUY THIS.usic videos,and all these are in this book.One of the first few pages you'll see a skelaton with long hair and think of it as alittle disturbing,but to some unique.He even draws little hand symbols to show how close he came.There is also some crazy comic strips that are really well drawn and pretty funny.Like the comic with the macho redneck.

About five years ago I picked up a copy of this book at the local library after I was referred to it by a librarian. It was one of those boring summers we kids suffer from, and I needed action. <br /> <br />This book delivered. Just when I guessed the plot, I was proven wrong. When I thought I knew how it was going to end, I was wrong. When I thought the character was in some deep trouble, I was wrong (of course, when I thought the character was in smooth-sailing, I was also wrong!) That is why I love this book so much... It challenged me to think of how it was going to change rather than the cliche endings and plots we have read thousands of times before. <br /> <br />Needless to say, I returned the book (it was very hard. I was ready to lie to the librarian to keep it!) As usual, life beckons and I never really sought to get a copy; this was, of course, prior to my Amazonian days. <br /> <br />For the last five years I have often thought about the book, and for the life of me, I could not remember what in the world the name of the book was... Wouldn't you guess that I would find it while looking up Monty Python movies? <br /> <br />In any event, if you like action-adventure-scifi-cool wormhole travel beams that magically appear in the desert-and more, then you will totally dig this book. In fact, if you like any fictional texts at all, you will like this book. Get it, read it, analyze it, enjoy it.

In any case...<br /><br />This is far from my favorite C J Cherry book...<br /><br />Which is to say it is a very good book, just not one of the top twenty books I've ever read.<br /><br /> Ms. Cherryh is in my opinion the greatest writer living or dead when it comes to culture, and world creating. In this story there are three which are dealt with. Primarily, there is the culture of a quarantined space station, what would make life worth living for young adults in a place where there is no real struggle or getting out. The moral of the story seems to be the role of art, (strangely in this story the art of personal appearance), in society. There is a typical Cherryh disdain for how politics always get in the way of good and talented people doing the right thing.<br /><br />Secondarily, the culture of the planet below is dealt with, including the immortality of the protagonist of the previous story.<br /><br />And finally, the outside universe is dealt with as the paranoid who are afraid of what they don't understand.<br /><br />So if you don't want a story where you have to think, then this is not a story for you. Of course if you don't want to think,  C J Cherryh is probably not the author for you. Try Koonts. Or maybe Matthew Reilly, (both are authors whom I enjoy) depending on how you don't want to think. However if you want to explore the \\"what if\\" side of human interaction, and the shades of gray in character, this is one you might enjoy. I did.	2005-10-13

It was a decent story with the added dimension of some Chinese American culture, but it wasn't exactly a page-turner.  Though it is divided into 21 chapters, the end of one chapter tends to run right into the beginning of the next.  There is little feeling of suspense, and I was rarely left eager to know what was going to happen next.  Main characters are brothers (I don't remember how old they were supposed to be, but would guess about 11 and 8), and the story is told from the point of view of the older brother.  Though this book was not what I'd call a \\"must read,\\" we enjoyed it enough to stick it out to the end.	2005-10-13

US	12085510	R14R65UINRS1QU	0590409433	33953133	Fallen Angels	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Great Read	Fallen Angels is a historical fiction book about the Vietnam War.  The book begins when the main character Perry is waiting to get on a plane to take him over to the foreign country.  He meets a young nurse that he talks to for a little while and then she leaves rather quickly.  Perry is from Harlem, and his mother and his younger brother Kenny live there.  He often writes to them throughout the book.  When Perry goes over to Vietnam he meets a guy named peewee who becomes his best friend.  They are put into the same platoon and same location where they meet several other guys that they fight alongside for the remainder of the book.  The story frequently jumps from calm almost normal living, to intense firefights and gruesome violence.  This book is probably suitable for ages 16 and up for strong language, racial gestures, along with intense violence.  <br /> This book is four stars for several reasons, Myers creates a very realistic main character; he is not a Rambo or a super genius.  Perry is just a regular black male from the streets of Harlem who lives middle class life and is only in the war for the money he gets paid.  This gives an \\"at home\\" feeling.  Perry is definitely not some manly super solider who can kill Vietcong at will.  This is a guy who is deathly afraid every time he has to go out on to patrol,  a man who cannot see the Vietcong he is shooting at sometimes, and can only hear the whiz of bullets in the pitch darkness.  Perry is a character that can be related to in everyday life; he is a son and a brother, who just wants to come out of this conflict alive.  Coming out alive seems to be a recurring theme throughout this novel.  Instead of trying to show a bunch of heroic soldiers killing Vietnamese people. Myers stresses the fact that these are all ordinary men.  Men, who are counting down the days when their lives are no longer at risk, and they get the opportunity to go home.  For example, one of Perry's commanding officers has only a small amount of days left \\"in country\\".  As the novel progresses and the day comes closer to when he can leave, his soldiers start to protect him and make it a point to keep him safe.  This shows how much each soldier respects the desire to go back home and will try to make it happen for themselves as well as their comrades.  Finally my last reason why this book is a heart will mostly appeal to male readers.  This book is about Vietnam so of course it is action packed and filled with gruesome incidents.  Some of the things are very sad and almost unbelievable, but the firefights are fun to read and the book keeps you on the edge of your seat.  But it is not all action, humor thrown in there every now and then, shows the reader that the soldiers are still human.  All in all this book is one that should not be passed over because of its historical relevance and brilliant writing by Walter Dean Myers.     <br />	2005-10-13

The majority of the text is written in the form of quick diary notes commenting on some particular topic of the day.  Next day's notes might concern a completely unrelated issue.  Then there could be an inexplicable gap of a few days with no entries in the diary at all.  There is no sense of continuity of events.  The book does not present even one map - how one can discuss military operations without maps is a mystery to me.  On top of all that, the editor has done a terrible job too.  The introductory essay as well as the subsequent chapters is riddled with grammatical mistakes, making the book even more unbearable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, none of the above becomes immediately apparent upon quick look at the book, which is beautifully bound, has great paper and exquisite selection of fonts.<br /><br />Mind you, I am not suggesting that Fedor von Bock himself is not a fascinating commander - he may very well be, but there is no way of telling from this book.	2005-10-13

I have also lived most of my life in Utah, specifically the Salt Lake area.  I originally picked up the book because I wanted some great ghost stories and really came back with what I already felt or believed about their presence.  I think Linda didn't focus on the evil or gore because there is already too much of it in the world.  I also believe that as Linda is one who is very sensitive to matters of the spirit and past experience we may not understand how overwhelming it may really feel to experience tragic or evil situations.  I picked up rather quickly that when it was an overtly intense, sad, or evil feeling experience she left... she chose not to go there.  So yes, if you are looking for that kind of experience, this is not the book for you.<br /><br />  However, if you want to read a book that may cause you to look at the little grove of trees by the Cotton Bottom and hear an old man wistling a tune as he works happily in his yard or look at the Hotel Utah and think of a time when it wasn't quite so reverent this is a place to \\"live in\\" for a moment.  I will never look at Jordon Commons the same without thinking of a bus full of children headed for school on a wintry morning colliding with a tragic fate.  My grandmother went to Jordan high at that time, she was fifteen...what did she loose in that accident?  Her innocence?  Her best friend?  I will never look at an old building the same.  Now they are living, breathing entities with stories to be told.  I drive around now and picture my ancestors working in the mills that filled the valley.  Some may still walk amongst us and we may catch a wisp of movement or the sense of their strength and perseverence.  It's the feeling of continuity that this book gave to me, the feeling that we are not so far seperated from those who came before us and loved their land.  It was a time before every house is at risk of being torn down so that two or three more can replace it as the land is swollowed up...a land that holds the memories of their hard working hands building a future they believed would be filled with their children's children's children.  I love Utah more now than I ever have before.<br /><br />  I liked the comments and involvement of mormon culture and I am a strong mormon.  I can see where Linda got her roots and they have influenced so much of the way she sees life.  I was interested to hear some of the ways we mormons approached life when we first arrived here.  Knowing better helps me to understand some of my neighbors better and why there are sometimes harsh feelings under the surface that date from a long time ago.  I like being informed.<br /><br />  I don't want to write my own book here but this book was a little bit of magic for me.  It seemed that everytime I read about a certain place I would run into someone tied to it somehow and we would talk about what I had read.  I would read at night and the next day I would drive past the place on my daily errands.  Linda, I hope you read this some day and know how much I have enjoyed it.  Thank you for all the time you did take.  Thank you.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Rebecca<br /><br />Salt Lake City	2005-10-13

Baseball for Lance, Life for Farrell	It seems Farrell Kaye is familiar with playing games alright, but apparently doesn't limit himself to baseball.  His ultimate goal is obviously aimed at using and abusing his unsuspecting victims (in this case, the readers) while he gets off on watching us swallow his illusory stories and fantasy tales.  Here, it's the story of \\"Lance,\\" his obvious alter ego, an irresponsible wanna-be baseball star who systematically screws up every opportunity life presents him due to his inability to grow up and see life as more than a \\"big game of chess.\\"  The parallels between Lance and Farrell Kaye are hard to ignore, especially that of male stripper and porn star.  It's sad that apparently Kaye has adopted the characteristics that so many in the sex industry have learned --lies and manipulation. Kaye lies to his readers by attempting to pass off a book that is so self-absorbed and amateurish as \\"literature\\" and manipulates them by actually expecting us to feel warm and fuzzy toward a chump who's an irresponsible, drunken rebel who's into sex and himself!  Can you say \\"NARCISSIST??\\" As much as I would have wanted to say I enjoyed this book and even had a glimmer of compassion for this character, I just can't do so.  Rather, the end result of my brief acquaintance with Lance and Farrell Kaye has been nothing short of painful.  I highly recommend that you RUN in the other direction from any association to this book and author.  I certainly wish I had.	2005-10-13

He's not saying anything that hasn't been said before, and better. Basically this is a well-written, seemingly powerful but ultimately shallow and heavy-handed piece of work by a writer with the sensibilities of a pimp. What I strangely find the most galling is his hypocritical attitude towards women, firstly, and the way he repeats phony white liberal feminist cant about \\"black patriarchy,\\" which even he knows is just some crap that the media Establishment made up to make us look bad. Kevin Powell mistakenly believes that his account is some sort of official version of the Black American Experience. It isn't. Kevin Powell is Kevin Powell, a basically immature, confused young black kid(though he's older than me)who is incapable of telling his own story and glibly accepts the white liberal version(s) of it. Furthermore, he is obviously scared to dig a little deeper, beneath that phony New York crap, and really look at how this country operates--I guess it's because he isn't as disturbed about how this country operates as he lets on. He didn't have a damn thing to say about either Katrina or the Iraq War, which just goes to show. Had he truly been in James Baldwin's caliber, rest assured he would have gone on television kicking everybody's ass. <br /> <br />I gave it two stars for the quality of writing, NOT the content, which is basically just trash.	2005-10-13

The precision and sparseness of Perowne, the neurosurgeon at work contrasted beautifully with his luxurious, decadent personal life filled with poetry, blues, food, wine and holidays in a French chateau with a drunken poet. <br /> <br />Into this calculated, controlled world comes chaos.  Chaos in the form of unexpected events, brain disease, unexpected emotions and unexpected discoveries.  But in the end, order prevails and the day comes to a neat tidy end for Perowne. <br /> <br />Insight(the London terrorist attack on the underground in rush hour), eloquent and measured prose and a glimpse into a world of neurosurgery where most of us will never go combined to make this an unputdownable novel for me.  The relaxed pace was great, it made me slow down and read more carefully - for me something I love in a book.   Saturday's calm reassurance and measured prose makes it my favourite McEwan novel yet.

US	36642996	R3LNJ19Y71TP2F	080211802X	160181524	The Third Brother: A Novel	Books	5	3	9	N	N	A complex and engaging sophomore effort	Young and passionate authors, celebrated for their raw and fiery prose, are often allowed to get away with less-than-skillful technique, hole-ridden plots, unrealistic characters and messy dialogue. Authors whose first books are published before they can legally drink are lauded (and rightly so) just for being so good at such a young age. With the publication of their subsequent works comes the questions of whether they can transcend their youthful literary style, whether their style and technique has matured, whether they have a viable literary voice, and whether their fame and recognition was solely reliant on their youth. <br /> <br />With the publication of his second novel, THE THIRD BROTHER, Nick McDonell faces just such a test. His debut work of fiction, TWELVE, which was hailed as \\"fast...relentless\\" and \\"a beautifully tragic and unsettling story,\\" launched the then-17-year-old author headlong into a kind of literary celebrity that recalled the reception of LESS THAN ZERO by Bret Easton Ellis in 1985. In both cases, the praise of the novel was inextricably bound up in the youth and youthful voice of its author. Ellis managed to outgrow that initial swoop of fame and prove to be more than just a transient literary fad. With THE THIRD BROTHER, McDonell shows promise enough to follow in Ellis's footsteps and establish himself as something more than just a 17-year-old flash in the pan. <br /> <br />The novel begins with blue-blooded, Harvard-educated Mike's forays into the drug-addled hippie hangouts of Bangkok, Thailand, where he is on assignment for his internship in Hong Kong. Ostensibly there to infiltrate the scene, he also has been sent by his boss --- his father's ex-Harvard chum --- to undertake the task of tracking down an old roommate, a close friend and an ex-reporter named Christopher Dorr, whose history with Mike's father and their close-knit circle of college friends is thorny and convoluted. Dorr had gone to Bangkok to research a story and never returned, dissipating into a sultry and debauched world. <br /> <br />What Mike discovers in Thailand --- about his father, about Dorr, and about himself --- is enough to throw his once-stable conception of identity, of family, and of good versus evil completely off-kilter. And Mike's struggle with, and final acceptance of, the closest truth he can find is well-depicted. We see the initial Mike, a serious but coddled young man who is accustomed to easy answers, face ugly truths about human nature and human instinct. We see those truths change him, but in a way that is natural and steady, and never forced. <br /> <br />When we meet up again with Mike, his parents have died in a fire, the work of his always-troubled older brother Lyle. Lyle has descended into a kind of madness, and Mike has transferred to Columbia to look after him. Mike and Lyle's story begins and ends on September 11, 2001. Any writer who attempts to make use of that day in their work faces the inevitable allegations of literary manipulation --- of attempting to milk an instant so full of national pathos that the author can lazily fall back on the emotions it induces in readers and imagines there is no need to create any with his or her words. <br /> <br />Yet McDonell evades this accusation simply by presenting Mike's life as relatively gloomy even before the first plane hits. The collapse of the towers, the chaos in downtown New York, and the panicked, nervy journey that Mike makes downtown to see his brother are all written at a kind of frantic pace. McDonell captures the breathless fear, the seeming absurdity and need for movement --- for action of any kind --- that that day invoked. As the novel propels itself to a climactic finale, the delusions of Lyle echo the madness of the world, made suddenly very real to a once-sheltered nation. And the capacity for evil that America suddenly must bear witness to echoes Mike's own revelatory experience in Thailand. <br /> <br />The novel is divided into three sections. The first, in Thailand, takes place over about a week. The second, in New York City, details the events of just one day. The third takes place a year later and darkly presents the consequences of the first two. All three are made up of quick --- often less than three-paged --- chapters. All are interspersed with a series of flashbacks to Mike's childhood and the events that culminate in his parents' deaths. Thus, THE THIRD BROTHER is rather technically complex --- asking the reader to travel with Mike's subconscious back and forth in time, to jump from the laconic heat of Thailand to the rapid-fire events of September 11th and beyond, and yet to still remain engaged. McDonell succeeds in holding his reader to the potentially unwieldy story with his uncanny ability to render scenes and places with simple language and direct sentences. <br /> <br />It is in describing a very specific scene --- a backyard in the slums of Bangkok, or the 24-hour bar of a sleazy hotel --- that McDonell proves his staying power. His skill lies in his very real ability to bring his reader into the world on the page. It is to McDonell's credit that he doesn't try to infuse his prose with flowery descriptions and complicated sentences; it bespeaks a kind of self-assurance that, for a 21-year-old, is both unsurprisingly age-appropriate and surprisingly earned. He is a talented writer who will keep getting better --- and luckily we are along for the ride. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Jennifer Krieger	2005-10-13

I am a communication studies major and currently taking a class on ethics. In this class I have had the opportunity to explore the many perspectives and attitudes regarding ethics. In this book, Patterson & Wilkins employ many examples and cases in which ethical decision-making requires a significant amount of critical thinkings, review of alternatives, and the actual consequences that transpire from a final decision. <br /> <br />This book is an excellent read for those who plan to step into professions such as journalism or public relations. Patterson & Wilkins provide an excellent outline of guidelines, principles, and values needed in evaluating ethical dilemmas, perceptions of truth, the best interest of the public, individual duties and responsibilities, and were one's loyalties may rest. However, the applications offered in this book are of value to anyone who encounters these issues on a personal or professional level.  <br /> <br />One of the unique designs of this book is that it promotes developing personal standards of ethics and makes compelling claims that moves one to action and ownership of those actions.  <br /> <br />I recommend this book to all! My recommendation of this book is not just limited to those in the formal practice of communication. The issues and cases in this book are practical and representative of the encounters we will each face in ethical decision-making.	2005-10-13

She spent summers with her grandmother in Kingston, in a house overflowing with assorted, very colorful relatives. Early on Carole realized that she wanted to experience the world beyond the small towns she knew. Watching the space shuttle Challenger explode on national television was a turning point in Carole's life. She immediately realized what it was that she wanted to do --- she wanted to tell the story, not watch it unfold on television. <br /> <br />Armed with natural curiosity and a strong work ethic, Carole, a 19-year-old student at Hunter College, began her journalism career as a humble, unpaid intern for ABC. She was a quick study and soon became a production secretary for \\"Closeup.\\" Before long she was traveling to Cambodia for \\"Peter Jennings Reporting.\\" Carole was very well-suited for the career she chose. <br /> <br />It was at ABC where she met her Polish prince, Anthony Stanislas Albert Radziwill, nephew of Jackie Kennedy. A slow-starting attraction, often interrupted by their careers, turned into something serious, and culminated in Anthony and Carole's wedding in 1994. This would not be a typical marriage with children and happily ever after, although the newlyweds did not realize it at the time. It would be a threesome: Anthony, Carole, and Anthony's cancer. <br /> <br />Anthony and his famous cousin, John F. Kennedy, Jr., were like brothers growing up. As adults they still played clever practical jokes on each other, a game they referred to as \\"I got you.\\" Carole and John's wife, Carolyn, became confidants and best friends. The two young couples had a great deal in common and were together whenever their busy schedules permitted. <br /> <br />The book details Anthony's struggles with his illness and Carole's role in managing it, as if cancer could be managed. Anthony was the stoic patient, Carole the patient's advocate. They had an unspoken pact --- that Anthony would somehow overcome his disease. They never admitted to each other that he would not. Carolyn was devoted to Carole and spent hours at her side, buoying Carole's spirits and encouraging her to take care of herself, too. <br /> <br />Three weeks before Anthony succumbed to cancer, John's small plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean killing John, Carolyn, and Carolyn's sister. It was perhaps fate that Carole was the one to report the plane missing. <br /> <br />There are three important relationships in WHAT REMAINS: the brother-like bond between the two cousins, the close friendship of their wives, and Anthony and Carole's marriage. <br /> <br />On the book jacket four Adirondack chairs sit on a deck on a sandy beach. Three chairs face the ocean. A solitary chair faces land. What remains for Carole are the memories of fate, friendship and love, for it is her chair that faces land (life). Anthony, John and Carolyn's chairs all face the ocean. <br /> <br />WHAT REMAINS is a testimony to the human spirit. It is beautifully and honestly written. The reader feels he or she has peeked into the author's soul and glimpsed courage, wisdom and love. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Carole Turner	2005-10-13

As potential evidence for this, Ronner shows the amazing similarities between Abraham Lincoln, JFK & Ceasar; and then also between Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy.<br /><br />Then Ronner discusses the great number of \\"end of days\\" prophecies - why there are so many, and potential reasons for why they've all been wrong to date.  Could it be that we're constantly changing our future, and that previous prophecies were merely one of the many potential outcomes for our planet?<br /><br />The scientific evidence for prophetic abilities, as well as information on various \\"prophets/seers\\" is then provided, along with various types of divination techniques.

In James Frey's first book, the writing style was appropriate to the content. The sparse prose and lack of respect for writing rules complimented his approach to recovery, which was to disregard the 12 Steps and not recognize a Higher Power.<br /><br />In this, his second book, the style gets old quickly. The run on sentences are not effective, but annoying, and I had to reread several passages to keep up with the story. This is the story of Frey's life after the rehab clinic, including a short stint in prison, a life in Chicago where he frequents bars and watches his friends get drunk and a life in Los Angeles where he chooses to raise pit bulls and tries to make a go of it in the film industry. All the while, he hangs onto a friendship with a mobster, Leonard, who drops into his life and keeps him fed. Leonard is his security blanket.<br /><br />I took the advice of one Amazon reviewer and didn't read the last page of A Million Little Pieces where the author summarizes the futures of his rehab pals, so reading My Friend Leonard was, perhaps more interesting without the \\"plot spoilers\\" contained there. But had I gone into this book knowing more about Lilly or Leonard, there's no way I would have finished it.<br /><br />Through these two books, Frey has succeeded in getting me interested in his life, his good health and his career.

Wyman's prose brings the Montana Rockies and California's Sierra Nevada so much to life that they become characters in the story, always challenging and testing the people who love and live and work in them. Running throughout is a reverence for the power and nature of high country, the pack animals and their packers who inhabit that world, and the culture that's grown from the terrain. There's also an equally strong current of humor to be found througout -- these are men and women who live with a passion, and are serious enough to see the humor in all that's around them. They are genuine characters, in both senses of the word. I'd recommend HIGH COUNTRY to anyone interested in the American West, history, mountaineering, horses, laughter, cowboys, packing, adventure, and the outdoor life. This is a book that, like an actual experience in high country, will stay with you long after you are home again.	2005-10-13

Deception by Grace, Lady Cavendish, is not very compelling and rather plodding at times. This novel could have been 20 pages shorter - perhaps then it would have flowed like the east side of the Thames, not like the frozen end where most of the story takes place. Even when the story floats us to the free-flowing end of the river, I still had a hard time following our tenacious trio, Grace, Ellie and Masou, because the action was overwrought with dramatic gestures and just plain boring. Where the first novels, Assassin and Betrayal are thrilling at times, nowhere in this novel did I find myself wondering \\"what's going to happen next?\\" ...frankly, because I didn't care. Patricia Finney, unfortunately, is not \\"writing as Grace Cavendish\\", but two other authors are, and I wonder if this tag-team approach mangled the once enjoyable and promising series. We are only up to D...hopefully, Patricia Finney will take up the quill again. I wish I could recommend this book without trepidation, but I just can't. I do agree with the previous review, that the Elizabethan world of the Frost Fair is well represented. Too bad the mystery was left out in the cold as a result! <br /> <br />Exile is the next installment of the Lady Grace Mysteries. <br />	2005-10-13

I have three of his PSpice books (including this one).  The book is written in a clear straight forward manner.  The program itself is not friendly and easy to use. Possibly, it appears unfriendly because it is complex, powerful and with many good features. The author describes and explains the complex concepts in a clear manner with good examples.  For users who are familiar with previous versions of PSpice that used Schematic to enter a circuit and start an analysis, the book provides direction on how to switch over and employ Capture.  The only reason for only 4 stars is that some of the graphics are poor quality. It is not uncommon to find black text on dark grey background which is difficul to read.  Color graphics would be nice, but it may be too costly.  Anyone starting with Capture and PSpice will benefit from this book.  It certainly is better than the documents provided by the program originator.	2005-10-13

Brian Floca figured out something for \\"The Racecar Alphabet\\" that a lot of author/illustrators could benefit from remembering.  If you're writing a book, be it alphabet, fairy tale, or plain old run-of-the-mill fiction, and your story is about a non-fiction subject, do adults like me a favor and include some factual information at the beginning for them to bone up on.  That way, when they read this book to their hepped up five-year-olds, they'll avoid the embarrassment of a blank stare that comes when a preschooler asks, \\"Why are the racecars driving through a city and not a racetrack?\\".  It's funny, but the only real problem I've had with this book is that it IS an alphabet book.  If it were not, it would probably have a much wider audience.  Sometimes the choices an author makes are more confining than they can anticipate.  Doesn't make the book bad, though.<br /><br />The book's endpapers consist of eighteen racecars dating between a 1901 Ford 999 to a souped up 2001 Ferrari F1-2001.  On the front endpapers, the cars face towards the reader.  On the back endpapers they face away.  The fact that Floca took the time to make a change that most people won't even notice is a great way of understanding this book.  Floca is, if nothing else, meticulous.  After a quick note on, \\"One Hundred Years of Racecars\\" we reach the title page and an image of a man driving a very clunky, mighty dirty car down a dirt road.  The first double page spread reads, \\"Automobiles - machines on wheels\\".  And we're off!  Each letter begins a sentence that describes the racecar attitude right from the start.  Sometimes these sentences are alliterative jolts of energy like, \\"Flat feared and fought, the driver's foe\\".  Sometimes (as in the case of an injured driver) they're a single word.  \\"Yelp!\\".  By the end of the book we have witnessed a variety of different cars over the years and an increasingly complex sport.<br /><br />My husband just looked over my shoulder as I was writing this review and felt it necessary to point out that it is really difficult to draw cars.  Now imagine drawing a shockingly wide variety of them.  You have to be able to distinguish a car that was clearly popular in 1976 to its hoity-toity 1992 equivalent.  So well done there, Mr. Floca.  My husband also points out that the book completely skips over the period of history where moonshiners started racing their cars in the Southern hills.  No such tribute to these racing pioneers appears in this book.  You may be relieved or outraged as you see fit.<br /><br />In my experience, \\"The Racecar Alphabet\\" is hampered only by the word \\"Alphabet\\" in its title.  Intelligent preschoolers who're into automobiles will pass on this book because they think the alphabet is too babyish for them.  I often want to explain to them that the alphabet aspect of this publication is hardly the focus.  You wouldn't even necessarily know it was there unless someone pointed it out to you!  My pleas fall on deaf ears, though, and I wish that Floca had been a little less original in his formatting.  An odd wish.<br /><br />Brian Floca is, at this point in history, probably best known for the illustrations he's done for Avi's mighty popular (and well-written) \\"Poppy\\" series.  For kids that are just a bit too young for Avi's mouse tales, however, \\"The Racecar Alphabet\\" will serve as an excellent introduction to Floca's work.  Technically adept, informative, and a lot of fun, this is one car title that deserves to be on any racing fan's shelf.

I didn't even bother to finish reading it.  I only read about 30 pages before I threw it away, then remebered it was a library book.... woops..... oh well, it was worth it.  To begin, the style was so, poetic and it really wasn't suited to the \\"plot\\", if you could call it that.  This author made a really sad attempt to modernize her stories or give them a new twist.  If you like fairy tales with a twist check out Gail Carson Levine, the author of Ella Enchanted.  Not only was the style dissapointing, but this book was depressing.  The fairy tales all seemed so grim and suggestive, throught out the entire thing I imagined dark grey clouds and windy, empty days.  And her version of Snow White was just wrong.  Snow White like fell in love with her dad and it was all really gay.  I got this book because I wanted a new version of Beauty and the Beast, but in this book she pictured the Beast as a stupid dog.  Beauty by Robin McKinley is really a good read, I've read it twice within 24 hours.  If you are looking for some good fairy tale or fantasy books I suggest you look at Gail Carson Levine, Robin McKinley, and Terry Pratchett.  Do not get this book unless you fell like messing up your sense of happiness and enjoy defacing timeless fairytales.  Please look at the Robin McKinley books, they are really a lot more worth the effort!	2005-10-13

electrodynamics and quantum mechanics.<br />I read this book to teach myself quantum optics.<br />Since I read it as a self-study text,<br />I will review it from that perspective.<br />Some of the weaknesses noted might be less important for a classroom text.<br /><br />  The Gerry/Knight text is billed as suitable for<br />\\"senior undergraduates and beginning postgraduates\\", but<br />I fear that undergraduates who attempt it as a self-study text<br />are likely to end up frustrated.<br />I can't recall ever encountering an undergraduate with a background in mathematics and quantum mechanics<br />sufficient to read this book in a reasonable time without the guidance of an instructor.<br />If used for self-study, I think that minimal prerequisites<br />would be a graduate level understanding of abstract linear algebra and quantum mechanics.<br />Some familiarity with Fock space and the theory of operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces would be desirable.<br /><br />  Because the book is intended for beginners,<br />the authors take pains to explain many things which a beginner might not know.<br />Most of the explanations were careful and helpful, but I was dissatisfied with some.<br />I read the book cover to cover and was able to follow most of it,<br />but some of it (e.g, much of the chapter on decoherence)<br />is still a mystery to me.<br /><br />  Chapter 9 describes recent experiments in quantum optics which<br />demonstrate amazing properties of light unimaginable from a classical perspective.<br />The presentations of the physical setups give just the right amount of detail for clear understanding.<br />The diagrams are good.<br />However, I felt that the mathematical analyses would be easier<br />for those with good backgrounds if done on a higher level,<br />and some of the physical discussions seemed obscure.<br /><br />  Given the authors' intended audience,<br />it may be unreasonable to quarrel with their choice of mathematical level.<br />However, it is truly unfortunate that some of<br />their calculational details seem actually wrong.<br />For example, in Section 9.3's discussion of a ``quantum eraser'',<br />several terms appear to be omitted from equation (9.21),<br />which invalidates some of the subsequent discussion.<br />Moreover, the discussion is obscure and seems of questionable validity even were the text's (9.21) correct.<br />More details can be found on my website.<br /><br />  I noticed only a few errors which would affect the physics,<br />but there are too many mathematical errors and<br />an unusually large number of typos.<br />Most of the typos are relatively insignificant,<br />but nevertheless distracting.<br />Readers should be prepared to check everything.<br /><br />  My copy is by now riddled with underlined statements with marginal notes<br />like \\"Why?\\", or \\"What does this mean?\\"<br />As I progressed through the book and my understanding deepened,<br

of the book were more carefully written,<br />but he will not be fundamentally disappointed.<br />This is a good book from which I learned a lot.<br />It seems much clearer than Scully and

Surfing through Amazon one day, I saw this book and thought it would look interesting. Regretfully, it was wasted money spent.<br /><br />Her overall plot while could have been intriguing got bogged down by details that I found distateful and chick-lit like.<br /><br />After 180 years of abstinence, the heroine, \\"Daphy\\", gets attracted connection w/ her new boss.  A job position that she has been forced to take.  Practically, on the same day she forces a kiss on her anti-vampire biased boss, she falls in lust w/ another agent (who may be a vampire slayer) that is working at cross purposes to her new agency.<br /><br />If there is any love or romance in the book, it was poorly written. There's plenty of sex, but pretty emotionless w/ no heat unlike some of the other paranormal authors like Christine Feehan, Sherrilyn Kenyon, or the new comer JR Ward.<br /><br />Frankly, I read a couple of chapters, and skimmed the rest just to see if the heroine would end w/ her boss instead because there seemed to be more of a romantic connection there in the first couple of chapters than the entire book w/ \\"Daphy\\" and \\"Darius\\" the vampire slayer.<br /><br />With so many series out there like Kim Harrison, Feehan, LK Hamilton, MJ Davidson, and C. Harris there is now trend toward authors cashing in on the paranormal themes.  Unfortunately I don't think the publishers are being too discriminating in their zeal to get into the paranormal trend.<br /><br />To sum up the plot, a 500 year old vampiress looser w/ no goals in life, gets conscripted into being a spy or else get a stake in the heart.  She of course chooses the job. From there her job is to spy on a terrorist plot while another agent from another agency is trying to do something similar.<br /><br />I have to agree w/ another reviewer that commented that Daphy was supposed to know about 13 languages and be like a genius, she came off as practically another dumb blond (although she's back haired) more interested in figuring out what to put on and where the best places to shop are.<br /><br />The only thing of interest in the book was the changing into the winged form.  That was somewhat original. But the book did not really explain where vampires come from how the heroine or her mother came to be. Obviously, a human can be made into a vampire, but if you were born from a union from a human and vampire mix, were you born a vampire or not? The book did not explain that.<br /><br />Also, special warning to romance readers, the book did not end w/ a HEA. Obviously, the next book is either setting up another love interest or continuance of the agnst from the Darius - Daphy conclusion of this book. Sorry, not hooked. Will pass on any future books of this series.in figuring out what to put on and where the best places to shop are. <br /> <br />The only thing of interest in the book was the changing into the winged form.

He wants to make a fortune off the Middle East. Look at how much oil's there. Look at all the money he previously made from oil.

If there's a God up there, I am willing to bet any money his agendas and Dubya's violently clash. And people who call themselves Christians, have the nerve to claim they have values, vote for him and continue to support him even as he let millions of Americans die in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Instead of fixing major problems on the homefront (such as poverty, unemployment, and the city of Detroit), Bush is more concerned with being an international police force. Guess what?

St Anne's Oxford University <br />At St Anne's College we have as our foremost objectives academic study, learning and research. We foster these by being an egalitarian and open college, by having significant teaching strengths in all subjects offered at admission, and by maintaining a large undergraduate library.  <br /> <br />The college was founded to champion equality in education at the end of the 19th century, and St Anne's remains committed to the same in the 21st. We admit the candidates who display the highest academic potential, imagination and enthusiasm, no matter what their background. Our vigorous, diverse and fully mixed undergraduate body is one of the largest in Oxford.  <br /> <br />The college awards a number of scholarships and prizes for academic performance, generous grants for vacation travel, and offers some exceptional opportunities for study in Japan and work-experience in the USA. We also assist students in the purchase of computers. As well as participating in the Oxford Bursary Scheme, the college can help students who encounter unforeseen financial difficulties while on course.  <br /> <br />Location <br />The college is situated slightly north of the city centre - perhaps five minutes by bicycle - just by the University Parks, and near to the University's Science Area. There are small shops nearby in Jericho for day-to-day supplies, an area which boasts a fashionable nightlife.  <br /> <br />Accommodation <br />College can offer single study-bedroom accommoda- tion to almost all those who wish to live in. We have recently built two new buildings, where many of the rooms have an en-suite shower, and a third providing over 100 rooms at the moment, four rooms are specially constructed with disabled access in mind. All rooms on the college site are provided with computer network sockets.  <br /> <br />Courses not offered <br />Archaeology and Anthropology; schools involving Theology; the Joint School of History with English; History of Art; Human Sciences.  <br /> <br />Facilities <br />With its long opening hours, and ready responsiveness to students' needs, the college library is a valuable and popular resource. Around 110,000 volumes are on-shelf for current use, making it one of the two largest undergraduate libraries in Oxford. Subject collections are well funded: multiple copies of core texts are available for long-term loan, and new books are purchased to match student needs. Terminals provide access to the University's online catalogue and other databases.  <br /> <br />Supplementing the college-wide network, the undergraduate computer room holds a range of useful software and networked printers, and email booths are dotted about the college.  <br /> <br />The extensive JCR complex offers games rooms, a bar, buttery, multi-gym, photographic dark room and music practice rooms. The college has a modern boathouse, and shares a nearby sports ground with St John's College.  <br /> <br />Our theatres provide a superb venue for lectures, drama and chamber music, and have been equipped accordingly.  <br /> <br />College student societies <br />Many subjects have related undergraduate societies, giving opportunities to discuss issues and applications beyond the academic. There is a college choir and orchestra. For the sporty, the college nurtures a number of 'serious' teams and eights, but there is also the full range of sporting events for those after sheer fun.  <br /> <br />Academic Staff <br />Biochemistry: Dr David Harris*  <br />Biological Sciences: Dr Martin Speight*, Dr Rosemary Hails  <br />Chemistry: Professor Jon Dilworth* , Dr Hugh Cartwright  <br />Computer Science: Professor Peter Jeavons*  <br />Alumni: Robert Davies, David Cameron, Thomas Bradley, Aaron Kalvani, Steve Wilkinson, Michelle Redgrave, Richard Perks, Tanya Blaire, James DeGraffenreidt, Tracy Hughes <br />Earth Sciences: Dr Don Porcelli*  <br />Economics: Dr Terence O'Shaughnessy*  <br />Educational Studies: Dr Graham Corney*  <br />Engineering: Professor Peter Ireland*, Professor David Murray*  <br />English: Dr Ann Pasternak Slater*, Dr Thomas Keymer*, Professor Kathryn Sutherland*, Dr Matthew Reynolds*, TBA*  <br />French: Dr Patrick McGuinness* TBA*  <br />Geography: Dr John Preston*, Dr Nick Middleton  <br />German: Dr Kerstin Hoge, Dr Tom Kuhn  <br />History, Ancient: Dr Edward Bispham  <br />History, Modern: Mr Peter Ghosh*, Dr Gareth Davies*, TBA*  <br />International Relations: Professor Neil MacFarlane*  <br />Italian: Dr Diego Zancani  <br />Latin and Greek: Dr Matthew Leigh*  <br />Law: Dr Karen Yeung*, Dr Liora Lazarus*, Dr Stefan Talmon*  <br />Management Studies: Dr Laura Empson*  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-13

The book explains the differences and why the choices were made.  Whats especially nice is the author discusses both views on a topic, rather than just presenting his choice.      Just a few of the major differences -   a) This version uses Strong Jump Shifts, but not the kind you think, there are 3 types and they dont all promise 19 points like the old ones.  b) 1 Diamond - 2 Clubs is forcing to 2NT or 3 of a minor rather than game a la Hardy  c) 2/1 is 95% game forcing, but may end up in 4 of a minor if 3NT is unsuitable  d) 1 Heart - 2 Clubs - 2 Hearts doesn't show 6 Hearts.  It shows 5 with no other rebid    The justification for these choices is explained.      2/1 is more complex than Standard American.  There are many bids with fairly precise meanings and you nee to know them if you are to use the system to its full effectiveness.  The book discusses the rules and then elaborates on them with lots of bidding problems (given the hands and the auction).  Compared to the Hardy book this gives a fuller more integrated system.    Example:  What is the difference bewteen 1 Spade - 2 Spades and 1 Spade - 1NT - 2 Clubs - 2 Spades?  The former is showing a better hand.  The later can have 3 Spades but will then have a bad 6-7 points.        I strongly recommend buying the 2/1 CD as well as it covers the material as well as adding a lot of newer competitive and constructive bidding conventions and has 125 quizzes.      The only negative is I think it would be helpful to have a list of bidding rules.  I went through Mike Lawrences 2/1 CD and thsi book and took 9 pages of system notes.  These helped me to learn and remember the 2/1 system.  If you are unfamiliar with 2/1 it may be hard to learn the system from this book because the \\"rules\\" are never formally stated, they are hinted at.  The way I learned 2/1 was to do Mike Lawrences 2/1 CD, then read this book, then read UncOntested Auctions.   (And I still dont feel entirely comfortable with the sysytem).  2/1 is complex.  If you and your partner don't know the system well you will noty get that much extra out of it, and you will suffer some costly mistakes.    Stay away from 2/1 unless you and partner are willing to invest a lot of time.  I like 2/1 and feel it was worth the effort.	2005-10-13

I've attended his seminar, spent hours in conversation with him and read the book.

That the 3 act structure is a natural story telling structure, hence it's widespread adoption and success.<br /><br />But he does not preach a strait-jacket of structure. He gives the writer tools to understand how structure can impact the success of story telling. And I have personally found his insights invaluable when understood in that way.	2005-10-13

As she writes, she also paints and sings--and prays. The basics of good literature are all present in Maddalena--a ripping good yarn, two or three strong central characters whose lives intersect momentously, a world of interesting others who swirl in and out of view, a setting which energizes and enhances the narrative, a moral to bring to epiphany. But perhaps the book's most interesting aspect is the surreal simultaneous interplay of the several arts which it celebrates and explores.

Obviously the work of a first-time author, CD Payne's Youth in Revolt uneasily lurches along a predictable path to a teenage nerd's ultimate fantasy ending.  Our protagonist, Nick Twisp, begins the story as a fairly standard Oakland dweeb, but in course of the book inexplicably transforms into some kind of clever, manipulative uber-genius sex god. Unfortunately, the transformation never comes across as believable.   <br /> <br />Part of the problem can be traced to the book's structure; Payne chose to write the stories in diary format.  Sometimes, though rarely, this method works for recounting tales.  In this case, Payne's insistence on using overblown vocabulary words makes the character's inner dialogue preposterous.  Nick's writing and speech reflect the voice of a 40 year old man.   <br /> <br />That his friends think and speak in a similar fashion - most of them also at 14 years of age - negates any semblance of verisimilitude.  In Payne's imaginary world people fall into two categories: brilliant and borderline retarded.  How could Nick's nitwit parents produce two kids who are so obviously morally, intellectually and emotionally superior in every way?  <br />  <br />At times the writing is laugh out loud hilarious.  Upon meeting a beautiful Indian girl, Nick inquires about the meaning of her name.  She responds eloquently (falling into the friend category so she's super-smart) and asks about his name's origin.  His droll response: it means a cut received while shaving.  Likewise, many of the incidents that occur - especially in the first 3rd of the book - caused me explosive fits of laughter too.  Even the middle portion of the book offers a few deliciously funny turns.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book deviates from the established characters and tone in the third act.  Nick's transformation into a wholly different person for the last third of the book means that much of his dorky fumbling and ridiculous overly convoluted machinations and day-dreamishideas slip away, along with his charm.  Suddenly, he's able to outwit everybody and essentially turns into a puppetmaster/do-gooder.   <br /> <br />Maybe Payne wanted to redeem the character's earlier failings?  Maybe he wanted to make us like Nick as some poor kid who hadn't been allowed to flourish under the harshness of his divorced parent's constant condemnation and unreasonable rules?  Whatever the reason, Payne's decision to morph Nick from underdog to Keyser Soze in training doesn't fly.  Nick's efforts culminate in ways that are too pat and many open arcs remain unclosed as if for a sequel.  Did Payne just lose steam? It's not as if Nick grows as a person either.  He changes, no doubt - becoming more cunning and sneaky - but he never matures into a character that has learned from past mistakes.  Payne's character goes from wild, almost cute, paranoid teen to hedonistic, mendacious sociopath.  Maybe that was the intention. If so, the book's extended climax (at least 50 pages), doesn't deliver on Nick's transition either.  <br /> <br />Furthermore, the ending seems more like every teen's dream come true but not in keeping with the tone of the rest of the book.  It's like Payne wanted a fairy tale ending tacked onto a story that's full of lies, deception, crimes and sex.   <br /> <br />Overall, Youth in Revolt amuses with sharp lines and a few very amusing incidents, but the tone and events in the book - sort of a poor man's Matt Ruff or Christopher Moore - never feels right with the supposed ages of the characters.  Suspension of disbelief only goes so far and then the comically absurd just becomes tedious writing by someone trying to prove to the reader how clever or smart he and his characters are.	2005-10-13

Hearing about \\"real world\\" examples, made me feel like not such a fool, if it had happened to me before.These short stories provide us, meaning teenagers, the oppurtunity to listen to others are age, and what they have to say. The author's actually have the guts to express and let other's read these life changing stories, so it'd be nice if they were good for something. Throughout the book, there are numerous stories in each sections. The Sections include, friendship, relationships, the power of love, family, lessons, tough stuff, overcoming obstacles, self-discovery and growing up. All of these topics are vital to teenage lives. So many things are bound to happen during what most people call these \\"rough\\" years, which would mean teenage years. The protagonist in these stories are the author's who reveal life secrets when they've been through something rough, or good. It gives us the oppurunity to reflect on life, love and learning. As a teenager, we go through so much, by reading the Chicken Soup books, it puts us in the position to deal with life, and realize others go through dramatic times as well. The themes of this book is life, love, and learning. Many stories were tear jearkers, yet some would give me the giggles. Honestly, this isn't one of those \\"fake books that the author just makes up a bunch of stories about the lives of teenagers.\\" It's a book where real teenagers pour their hearts out, so other's can listen to what they go through. If you enjoyed Chicken Soup for the Soul II, you would absolulty love Chicken Soup for the soul III, it continues on with more dramatic life changing stories that could even make an impact on your life.

Maybe one reason people seem to like them so much is because this stuff is complicated, and these books explain things quite clearly in understandable (and sometimes humorous) language. <br />This book is geared towards passing the certification exam, and as such tends to focus on smaller bits of digestible information, i.e., so you can answer typical exam questions. If you are really serious about becoming a servlet/JSP developer, I recommend checking out another O'Reilly book: \\"JavaServer Pages\\" by Hans Bergsten. Why? Because while Heard First's strength is trees, JavaServer Page's strength is the forest itself.

At the beginning, the focus bounces back and forth between Jerry and other important boys in the story.  Being a girl, I was slightly flustered at some of the more personal topics discussed. Now at first, I thought that Jerry's refusal to sell chocolates stemmed from wanting to fit in and be accepted, and even a little from fear.  But as I got deeper into the book, Cormier made me realize that even if those were the original causes of his decision, they certainly weren't the reason he carried on protesting, despite his fellow students becoming distant and even violent towards him.  It is a good reminder of how mean our fellow peers can treat people, if given the incentive.  Cormier also touched on how we can let our emotions take control.  Whether it would be fear, despair, loneliness, or anger.  When one of the boys was fighting in the book, he described how he couldn't believe that he had let anger take control and how he hadn't intended to act and behave how people wanted him to.  I was nearly misty-eyed at that point.  Another major theme of the book was about how people can persuade, manipulate, and even terrifying you into doing what they want.  One definition of power is the influence to get people into acting for your best interests.  And the secret society at this school has got it in spades.  While I didn't feel too much pity for the \\"bad guys,\\" Cormier made me view it from their perspective, and had me understand them.  That is something that I think all good writing should use. <br />	2005-10-13

US	29136933	R3R6ZKWBOWP8OE	0684859726	840593809	Fatal Voyage : A Novel	Books	4	3	3	N	N	The fourth in the Tempe Brennan series, and one of the best!	It's October in Swain County, North Carolina, and Dr. Temperance Brennan has been called to a location high in the mountains where Air TransSouth Flight 228, a passenger jet headed for Washington, D.C., has just crashed, killing all 88 passengers and crew members on board.  When Tempe arrives, she is faced with carnage the likes of which she has rarely seen.  Spare body parts fly high in trees bright with autumn leaves, and an abandoned and scorched Raggedy Ann doll almost brings the hard-headed anthropologist to tears.  Even worse is the knowledge of who was on board the plane:  college co-ed soccer players, on their way to a tournament in the U.S. capital; and Detective Jean Bertrand, the partner of Tempe's sometime love interest Andrew Ryan, who was escorting a prisoner back to Canada.  But strangest of all is the foot Tempe finds in the jaws of a coyote deep in the North Carolina woods.  Although her first assumption is that it belonged to one of the passengers on the plane, closer examination reveals that the foot is in a late stage of decomposition that doesn't match with the recent plane crash.  And the pathology of the foot proves her right:  It doesn't belong to any of the victims on board Flight 228.  But before Tempe can continue her investigation in a professional capacity, she is abruptly yanked from the investigation and cited with an ethical violation. <br /> <br />But this is the fourth entry in Reichs' series, and faithful readers know that our stubborn heroine isn't going to be stopped by something as puny as a direct order, right?  And FATAL VOYAGE offers no surprises, as far as Tempe's character is concerned.  With the help of Andrew Ryan, no-nonsense Swain County sheriff Lucy Crowe, and one irresistible chow named Boyd, Tempe begins doing her own research. She ultimately uncovers the origins of the foot--and the truth is more disturbing and bizarre than you could imagine. <br /> <br />I have to admit:  I wasn't wild about DEADLY DECISIONS, the third offering in the Tempe Brennan series.  It was a bit boring, actually, and disappointing compared to the previous two novels.  But in FATAL VOYAGE, Reichs is once again in top form.  The plot of the novel is smart and tight, the characters well-fleshed-out and intriguing.  And as always when you're reading a Reichs novel, in FATAL VOYAGE, you're going to learn something you didn't know (this time, it's the processes that are involved with airline crash recovery and how soil can tell investigators the time since a victim's death, and about old elitist clubs from England to the United States).  Reichs is one of the few forensic thriller authors I read who can effectively combine cold scientific rhetoric with warm, thoughtful characters.  <br /> <br />Reichs has taken command of her heroine in this fourth novel; the character of Tempe Brennan evolves gently and deftly.  She is a forensic anthropologist, yes--but more than that, she is a woman, one who desires both a lover's touch and a cuddle with her cat, who exercises religiously but doesn't hesitate to indulge in unhealthy snacks, who takes long baths and listens to jazz.  In FATAL VOYAGE, Tempe's relationship with ex-husband Pete is explored in more depth, and Reichs balances Tempe's feelings for her ex nicely with her growing interest in Detective Andrew Ryan.  Adding to Tempe's likeability even more in this fourth novel is her strength of character in the face of professional adversity and her overwhelming commitment to the bones who were once people with flesh and blood:  \\"The dead will remain dead, whatever my efforts, but there have to be answers and accountability.  We cannot live in a world that accepts the destruction of life with no explanations and no consequences.\\"  Her professional and personal life are balanced nicely in this one. <br /> <br />One of the best things about FATAL VOYAGE is that Reichs doesn't try to do too much.  In DEATH DU JOUR and DEADLY DECISIONS, she made sure that all of Tempe's cases, from Quebec to Charlotte, connected to each other in some way.  In this fourth book, the action is in North Carolina, and there are no unbelievable coincidences to cloud the reading of the novel.  FATAL VOYAGE is, on all levels, a success--I'm happy to see Reichs sticking with a formula that works and continuing to evolve her characters in realistic ways.  The critics are right that Reichs is similar to Patricia Cornwall--but she's also much, much better. <br />	2005-10-13

Not so with the Miles Vorkosigan series because Bujold allows her characters to grow and change with their experiences.  In the last book, Miles nearly lost his life but thanks to the miracles of medicine he has another shot at serving his world however, there are after effects of that resurrection. Miles comes face to face with limitations, limitations that could change is life radically. Meanwhile, on Barrayar changes are occuring that set in motion a chain of events that will change the face of ImpSec for years to come.<br /><br />Not much more can be said without spoiling the book for you.  However, there is a starkness to this book that causes the reader as well as Miles to evaluate the meaning of honor, justice, reward, and punishment.  Can we be true to ourselves if we are false to those around us? Does the end justify the means as long as we get what we want in the end? What are you willing to trade for your hearts desire? The passionate wanting of Miles to serve is so strong you just bleed for him in this no holds barred novel  where Miles faces temptation and must solve a mystery to save a friend.	2005-10-13

Lynne Cox largely avoids emotions, trivia, sentimentality and similar extraneous materials to deliver a very tightly focused account of her remarkable accomplishments in cold-water ocean swimming.  She easily could have gone into accounts of her personal life and fundraising activities, just to name a couple of topics, but elects instead to concentrate on her swims - and that focus, in my view, elevates this book ahead of most contemporary autobiographies.  As for the accounts of the swims, suffice to say that I found them gripping even though it's the sort of activity in which I otherwise have little interest.  Surely that alone is a strong sign of a well-written book.	2005-10-13

I believe Bakari Kitwana puts a completely new spin on this question due to his clear enjoyment and understanding of hip-hop.  He is able to look at hip-hop with less prejudice than many authors who have attempted to tackle this question.  Kitwana uses convincing reasoning, such as whites' decreasing sense of racial privilege, and strong opinions to advance his arguments on why white kids love hip-hop. <br />     I recommend this eloquent book to any hip-hop enthusiasts especially those interested in the question \\"why do white kids love hip-hop?\\"  Not to say that this book is by any means perfect, Kitwana has his own unique set of prejudices like anyone and he has a tendency to belittle the work of some less hardcore hip-hop fans.  Overall it is a wonderful book, a true must-read in my opinion.  This is an adult book but it is not terribly long or difficult to read and while it does feature some necessary racial epithets it doesn't uselessly throw around foul language.  A great book for the avid hip-hop listener or anyone who has ever wondered just why white kids love hip-hop.	2005-10-13

I continually find myself turning to it and reading it again and again. There are few pallets that match the constellation of Stephen Tanzer, David Schildknecht, and Joshua Raynolds, and they are all available within these pages. An invaluable tool that will save you costly mistakes and pay for itself in the selection of a single mixed case.<br /><br />Wine geeks frequently cite that this guide is for more easily obtainable bottles, implying a criticism of Robert Parker's phenomenal access to and reviews of obscure releases. In addition, the median price and price range of those wines considered here is less lofty than the Parker world. My own view is that there is a place for both, and that world wine offerings are so bountiful and complex that there is more than enough reason for the serious wine drinker, or the casual fan who wishes to maximize their budget, to read this guide and other leading critics' guides as well.<br /><br />A particular strength is Schildknect's appreciation for German and Austrian wines, and particularly in the case of the latter, the last true wine bargains on the planet. The complexity, fineness, and excellence of both terroire and grape are unmatched in Austrian whites. Couple that with excellent winemakers, then add the coup de graces: fewer corked bottles than white burgundy, and you have no contest. This guide is essential.	2005-10-13

This is one of the all-time classic series of comic books, reprinted in a beautiful new edition. The story is good (although Claremont's writing would improve in later issues) and the art, by Dave Cockrum, is simply stunning. And, of course, these stories served to introduce the most influential and popular Marvel characters since Spider-Man in the early 60s.<br /><br />So why the three stars? I was comparing this book to my original comics and I realized that the coloration had been changed significantly. This may seem like a minor point -- the pencil work and inking is, obviously, exactly the same as it was in the originals -- but the choice of colors used in this book does a lot to determine the \\"atmosphere\\" of the stories, and in this reprint, the atmosphere is a lot brighter, featuring noticeably more primary colors than the original comic books.<br /><br />In some cases -- e.g. the character Colossus -- a lot of subtle detail, created by the use of different shades of the same color, has been eliminated. The space-opera scenes are a lot more \\"cartoony\\" looking, with bright blue replacing the subtle blue-grey that was originally used for the exterior of the spaceships. Throughout the stories, panels that were previously colored in subtle earthy shades are now done in bright primary colors or some other high-contrast color scheme that completely changes the impression the artwork makes on one's eyes.<br /><br />This may seem like a lot of nit-picking, and I realize that the re-coloring was probably a mechanical requirement for reprinting the stories in full-color (rather than four-color), but I don't feel like the changes are really insignificant. Compared to the original comics, this book looks like a Saturday morning cartoon show. Considering that this is an extremely expensive deluxe edition, it seems to me like Marvel could have spent a little more time to get it closer to the originals.	2005-10-13

When you decide to incorporate a style of meditation into your life then a whole-body Vipassana might bring you more peace of mind. It is a sensation-based style of meditation.<br /><br />Marshall Glickman has a beautiful writing style and his ideas connect perfectly with the modern reader who may or may not be familiar with meditation. His ideas are presented in a way that makes meditation come alive. I used to think meditation was complete stillness and lack of thought, but there are ways to focus on sensation that bring you to a deeper understanding of yourself. Some of the intellectually intriguing aspects of this work include:<br /><br />The Power and Pleasure Principle<br />The Biochemical Basics of Pleasure<br />The Neurochemistry of Karma<br /><br />There are chapters filled with instructions on how to meditate, but the real highlights of this book are the insights into living life effectively and understanding how our bodies function on the chemical level.<br /><br />\\"Focusing on sensations puts us more directly in touch with what's motivating us, while at the same time helping to free us from the storylines which tend to obscure our feelings. In this way, greater awareness to our sensations increases our emotional sensitivity.\\" ~Marshall Glickman<br /><br />If you have trouble settling into a meditation session, do yoga first. It helps your body to work out all the extra energy that might keep you from sitting still. You can also meditate while reclining in bed or while sitting in a chair. You don't have to meditate in a guru-style seated position. I normally meditate while laying flat on my back after an invigorating yoga practice. Some of the most blissful happy places I've ever been have been after doing a Chakra Yoga workout. I finally understood the place meditation could take you.

It is a clever and interesting read for the lay historian--as well as an important book for researchers into early American history.	2005-10-13

I simply enjoy reading good poetry.  There are only a few of us.  You know, the people who read but don't write poetry.   <br /> <br />Different Hours is by far my favorite collection of poetry.  I've read many of Dunn's other collections, and have not been as impressed.  This has nothing to do with the little gold stamp on the corner of the cover, either.  The poems are well-balanced, and make you feel like Dunn has revealed something about his subject that is just under the surface - whether it be aging, weather, or nostalgic memories.  The feeling is similar to being around someone with a skill not your own, like playing basketball with someone who, unlike you, can dunk.  Unlike myself, and many writers I've read, Dunn is skilled in explaining feelings and observations in ways that actually make you feel like you've learned something about yourself. <br /> <br />Quite simply, reading poems like Zero Hour, Dog Weather, and others, will cause you to experience the ordinary in a new way that is both foreign and addictive.	2005-10-13

This book is a good addition to the \\"JKD library\\". It contains some interesting defensive concepts and street-fighting applications not contained in the same way in the other, so-called \\"better\\" JKD books. I recommend it. I have several books on JKD, because I am a JKD student and really concentrate on this art. This book is not as comprehensive as, say, the books by Chris Kent, but this is the book that I used at the beginning, when I was first learning JKD, and I think that this book is the best book I have seen at presenting the basics/intro. of JKD (the Kent book is better overall, but there is so much in them, that it is just overwhelming because he presents so much at once, whereas the Lamar Davis book gives you a very solid introduction, and I didn't find it overwhelming).	2005-10-13

All these one star reviews reek of something fishy to me.  Somebody has an agenda or an axe to grind with The Sports Guy.  If you ask me some people are simply jealous of Simmons' success, which is really the ultimate complement for a writer.  ANYWAY, this is an enjoyable compilation of all of Simmons' articles Re: The Sawx, over the past five years, culminating in the '04 Championship Season.  Yes, if you read the Sports Guy regularly you have probably already read most of the material in the book but these articles are eminently rereadable and Simmons has added some new material as well as some great new jokes with the footnotes.  If you take it for what it is, an easy, quick, light read, then you will enjoy it immensely.  If you're looking for the next great American Sports Novel (is there such a thing?) you might be disapointed.  Great for the toilet and the commute.	2005-10-13

First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks.  There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc.  This is our Second Chance on Earth.  No tribulation.  This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly.  Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian.  Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life.  It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message.  Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it.  But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies).  My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing.

No, it's not, but sometimes it comes a bit too close.  I notice that a Wiccan representative has a blurb on the back praising the book.  Funny. <br /> <br />True, Christianity doesn't do well in the U.S.A. post-Change, and the portrayal is fairly negative.  But, no problem with that in itself.  A real missed opportunity would have been to show the increased power the Anglican Church undoubtably has in England with the new monarachy.  This might have come at the cost of a few less pages of vegetation exposition (to author: you're a good writer, but you're no Annie Dillard.  Besides, your average reader probably wouldn't like Anne Dillard anyway). <br /> <br />What I was hoping for was an \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" second book in which our heroes get kind of fooked up by the Protector to come back in some ingenious way in the third book.  Instead, we see the little guys walking all over the big guy for 90% of the book until the Protector makes a very small win at the end.  This is novel, but doesn't do much for dramatic tension.   <br /> <br />Also, the plot at the end hinges on the significance of a minor character's fate (as he is put in dire jeapordy not once but twice in the last 70 pages).  Ok, I'm with you.  Except, for that to really work, we have to care a bit more for that minor character.  And we really are given no reason to. <br /> <br />Still, the 9 year leap forward and the sub-plot beginning in England are both brilliant.  The English character, Sir Nigel, is my favorite in the series so far, so I felt that that portion was knocked out of the park. <br /> <br />I gave 4 stars to the first book, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this one.  Once bought, I devoured it in 2 days and have no regrets.  If you're like me, you should get this book and hope for more in number 3.

This is the long-awaited follow-up to Getting to Yes (one of Roger Fisher's previous bestsellers).  Fisher basically created the entire field of negotiation.  And this new book is a great follow-up.  It tells you how to deal with emotions - yours and the other person's - in just about any interaction.  Fisher and Shapiro highlight five ways that you can improve the tone of just about any interaction (e.g., through respecting autonomy, affiliation, status, etc.).  The result is that you can get what you want.  I truly believe that anybody who negotiates - whether with family, a colleague at work, or a tough counterpart - can benefit from this book.  It's written in the same tone as \\"Getting to Yes\\" - i.e., you can read it in a few hours.  And just like Getting to Yes, there are a few big points that are completely practical.  I negotiate a lot of tough contracts as part of my job, and the ideas in this book are practical enough to use right away, and have enough depth that I know over time I'll understand them more and more...	2005-10-13

Kahn's stellar research for this volume on Coltrane's best known album, \\"A Love Supreme,\\" is undermined by sloppy prose and lack of focus.  Kahn does a great job showing just how powerful the album has been for generations of listeners, from Wayne Shorter to Bono.  The biographical material on Coltrane is very good, but profoundly impersonal, skipping over key aspects of his life.  The best part of the book is his meticulous documentation of the December 9 & 10, 1964 sessions that resulted in this album.  Kahn describes the music with vivid language, and includes details about where Elvin Jones' drums were placed and how Rudy Van Gelder lit the studio to create a Jazz Club atmosphere for the performers.  After that, Kahn's book loses focus.  It's as if he had a 100 page manuscript, but then the folks at Penguin asked him to make it 250, and he had scratch around for any extra material he could find.  His assessment of Coltrane's career post-\\"A Love Supreme\\" is very tepid, and the chapter on the legacy of the recording, especially from the vantagepoint of JOWCOL publishing, shows promise, but ultimately goes nowhere.  Kahn's major problem here is that he doesn't know who his audience is.  Is it for die-hard Trane-iacs, or is it for the casual listener that has \\"A Love Supreme\\" and no other Coltrane album?  Some of this might not be Kahn's fault, as the content suggests this is for experts, but the formating of the book, with its wide margins and coffee-table book size, make it seem as if it's simply for show and tell in some bourgeois apartment.  The book could have been better organized, more historically contextual, and filled with glossaries and footnotes for the more casual fans.  Also, Kahn's lack of historical grounding makes it seem as though \\"A Love Supreme\\" was the only album released in 1965, and that jazz was the most popular music at that time, which is far from the case (just as it is today).  Here, his homage to this wonderful album bleeds over into therealm of adulation.  If this was a book for the \\"experts,\\" it would be more critical of the album, instead of an all-out gush-fest.  But Kahn's research must be commended (especially since he seems to be responsible for getting the December 10th performance of \\"Acknowledgment,\\" with Davis and Shepp as added musicians, unearthed and onto the Deluxe Edition reissue of \\"A Love Supreme).	2005-10-13

Although technically I am past the baby-boomer age (I am 64) I was tempted to try the prescription the author gives to reinvent yourself using your own genius. In addition to being almost ready to retire (at least in that age bracket), I also appear that because of how I present myself (people have told me that) to others. So, when I lost my job nearly a year back, I had no will to go back into the job market and get rejected. I was willing to cruise down the retirement path with my pension and social security benefits. I always yearned, though, to get back to work and make good money at least for a few more years. Well, using the specific ideas in Rehired, Not Retired, I was amazed by how much of what is presented applied directly to me. Using one of the tools and the genius exercise, I was able to redo me resume and confidently send it out in response to jobs that I would not have even considered before reading the book. I have not had any action yet, but it is early. This book was a breakthrough for me personally. I am confident of my message now, something that I was not, before.	2005-10-13

If everyone else in the world thought you were crazy, would that make it true? For Richard Rahl, it just might.    In this book, Goodkind experiments with a more psychological style of story-telling. Though sometimes frustrating or confusing to read, the overall effect was immensely enjoyable. This book focused less on action (though there were certainly a couple of excellent sequences) and more on the relationships between the characters. Without giving away the ending (a cliffhanger), I'll just say that there are very significant changes in Goodkind's universe by the time this book ends: a new and terrifying enemy, a new Seeker, and finally we discover why the boxes of Orden were created in the first place.

I decided to read his book because I didn't know much about Cuba before Castro came into power. By means of entertaining and emotional childhood experiences, Eire gives the reader a touching journey through his carefree days in pre-Communist Cuba. Eire's descriptions of his neighborhood as well as Havana's natural settings are written in simple language, yet are very clear and calming. I sometimes felt that I was walking along the streets of Havana with the turquoise sea whispering in the background. I experienced the same kind of emotions I felt while I read \\"Angela's Ashes\\": sadness, appreciation for what I have, and incessant laughter. Eire may be a professor by trade, but this book exemplifies his ability to create a work of literature from his own childhood experiences. I pray that one day Mr. Eire will be able to visit his native country.	2005-10-13

It changed my diet and now, thanks to the ongoing information from the Weston A. Price Foundation [...] I feel healthier than I ever have!<br /><br />He explored how the healthiest people on the planet ate, how it affected their teeth and overall health.  He drops hints at the incredibly exciting life he had, like mentioning that he and his wife met a cannibal chief on the Pacific Islands, travelled to Alaska, and climbed the Swiss Alps.  And he found that age old dietary wisdom beats modern convenience foods hands down.<br /><br />One unexpected find that I've shared with some dentist friends is that he had a special diet that stopped the progression of cavities and actually re calcified the deteriorating teeth.<br /><br />The only flaw in the book was that I think he overlooked the very important role of salt in the native's diets.  They used it to preserve their food, and those who ate modern foods ate much less, since it was canned.<br /><br />Overall, a very good and important book!  I'd recommend reading it with Andre Voisin's book, \\"Soil, Grass, and Cancer\\" as together they paint an amazing picture of what is happening to the human race.	2005-10-13

Inkheart is a deep writen book, with the author's work just shining out others. It really has a dept for bookworms and book lovers like me. <br /> <br />To not give you, the reader, much away from Inkheart, a very long book, I'll only say that this book starts with the main characters Meggie and Mo, Mo a book doctor, and Meggie, an avid reader of twelve. There's also Dustfinger, a fire eater, Farid, a boy read out of Treasure Island, and Basta and Capricorn, villians made out of words from Inkheart. If you find this review confusing, it's because I'm really bad at summerizing great books like Inkheart.  <br /> <br />After reading Inkheart, I find myself reading late into the night, hoping to read the characters or creatures out of the book, but it never works.

Its eccentric characters could fit right into our own family scrapbooks, and its reverence for the past and suspicion of the encroaching future pose a conflict being played out across the length and breadth of Dixie-and might even be encapsulated in our ambivalence nowadays toward using the word \\"Dixie\\" as a synonym for the South.  <br /> Just outside of Palmetto, S.C., in the small town of Sans Souci, Cutter Johanson lives in a dilapidated mansion that houses the comforting ghosts of her ancestry. The urban sprawl of Palmetto, which is a thinly disguised Greenville, threatens to engulf the small town that has been home to Cutter's family for generations, but an even more immediate threat is that the death of Cutter's grandmother has brought the house up for sale. Desperate to keep the old home place, Cutter goes to great lengths to sabotage efforts to sell it, but she knows she is fighting a losing battle. Her sister Ginny, \\"the pretty one,\\" and brother Barry, away in service, are eager to sell, and Cutter, though working two jobs, both menial, can not afford to buy them out.  <br /> Enter a kind of Delphic fate: Ginny, a college student, is having an affair with a teacher, Daniel Byers, and is pregnant by him. His aggrieved wife Elizabeth is an emotional cripple whose agoraphobia and panic attacks keep her a virtual prisoner in her home, significantly a run-of-the-mill subdivision ranch house. Not least, Elizabeth's main affliction is a husband so caring that he seems to have an unhealthy need for his wife to remain a cripple. Stir into that mix an anonymous telephone tip to the unsuspecting wife, and a solution to Cutter's problem that she could never have imagined is set in motion. <br /> The attentive reader will see it coming when Elizabeth somehow manages to summon the strength to venture out and knock on the Johansons' front door. When Cutter answers the door, the die is cast: Two oddballs, one strong, one weak, come face to face, and the reader, recognizing their compatibility right away even if they don't, knows that they will wind up with each other when the dust has cleared-though in what arrangement is a nice, and logical, surprise.  <br /> The story of how all this happens is highly readable and, for the most part, deliciously written. Ms. Friddle's prose shines, especially with apt and poetic similes--but she comes awfully close to overdoing a good thing: Too many similes can be tiring and come across finally as the same artistic trick done too often to retain its freshness or, worse, as a kind of misdirection. Not for nothing did Gertrude Stein advise writers that in describing something it is usually better to say what a thing is than what it is like, i.e. \\"A rose is a rose is a rose.\\"	2005-10-13

Everest of biographies with this five-parter about the complex, self-contradictory, vain, politically problematic and always fascinating Hemingway. The book concentrates on that period between the publication of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" and the completion of his first draft of \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" three years later. It takes us from Hemingway's drafty art studio in Paris where he lived during and after his divorce from Hadley and the embarking on his marriage with Pauline Pfeiffer. <br /> <br />The pressure's on when, after the publication of \\"Men Without Women\\" in 1927, Hemingway needs to follow up \\"Sun...\\" with another equally brilliant novel. He frets with an idea about a son's journey from America to Europe with his father, a spy-for-hire. But then drops the idea. He marries Pauline, travels around France and Spain, writes a couple of more great short stories before launching into his tale of a wounded American soldier's love affair with an English nurse during WWI. Hemingway went from Paris to Key West to Pigotte, AK (where Pauline went home to deliver their new baby) to Montana, back to Oak Park to deal with a terrible family tragedy and back to Europe, all as he composed \\"Farewell.\\" What's so wonderful about Reynolds telling it is how emotionally caught up in these events you get--after all, Hem's wife delivered him a new son AND his Oak Park family collapsed and needed Hem to build it back up, both WHILE WRITING THIS BOOK--a heroic feat on Hem's part of artistic discipline. There are sections of Reynolds' book that left me in tears, especially his gorgeous closing sections where you really feel Hemingway has arrived at the threshold of myth--he's left his Oak Park boyhood and his young apprenticeship in Paris with Stein, Pound, etc. behind and come into his own--as a writer, a personality and a genius. <br /> <br />A beautiful, evocative, heartfelt tour de force.	2005-10-13

Works better as a gosippy tell-all on the early lives of the players his brutal boot camp helped make famous than it does as anything else. At times Bolletteri's ego speaks a little too loudly and the pace of the book bogs down because of things like the printing of letters he wrote to his one-time students. The man many consider the greatest tennis coach of all time admits here that those who charged he pushed teenagers too far too fast in pursuit of champions, were probably right. He tells some funny stories, like one about Andre Agassi having a collection of empty whiskey bottles in his room, even though no one ever saw the teen drinking and he was monitered almost around the clock as part of the regimented curriculum: a mystery to this day. I used to imagine what it would be like at this famous camp but after reading this book I was so turned off by the military school-like atmosphere described that I'm glad imagining is all I ever did. I guess the jury will always be out on Nick Bollettieri's role in the rise to fame of so many of those who spent time at his Florida center. Some like Mary Pierce credit Bollettieri with making them their best; others downplay their former coach's contribution. This is Nick Bollettieri's chance to put in his two-cents worth, and he does...or maybe it's more like a dollar's worth.	2005-10-13

It required the development of this book that gives a good introduction to functional analysis for statisticians and an introduction to statistics for functional analysts.  <br /> <br />The book is positioned so that it can be used for both groups of students. This is a delicate balance that can teach introductions (graduate student level) to both fields without leaving the other half of the class bored. As such it is not a text on either subject, but is inbetween. The sections on statistics are written from a viewpoint familiar to the functional analyst, not from that of a mathematician. And the reverse is true in the sections on functional analysis. This is to complete the view of the two groups typically taking the class.  <br /> <br />This is a graduate level course, it provides relatively little background information to the basic mathematics needed.	2005-10-13

The problem, however, is that the picture isn't very deep.<br /><br />Blumlein falls into the habit early in the book of waiting until the last possible moment to explain a new term he's using. Yes, it's interesting that there are Unerrants and Orts and melis and musk, but it would have been MORE interesting if he explained it the first time he mentioned it rather than forcing me to reread the chapter.<br /><br />He also tends to misuse pronouns, especially in dialog, (When you say \\"she said\\", tell me which SHE said it!) leading to confusing passages for the reader.<br /><br />As for the ending, rather than finding it grand or mythical, I found it rather nonsensical and weird.<br /><br />The concept of this book is very good and well thought out, however the excecution of it leaves something to be desired.	2005-10-13

But they are incredible mind-candy and difficult to put down.  There's also a heck of a lot of them, and given that they weren't written in a chronology synchronous with the chronology of Sharpe's exploits, it takes a little running around to read them in order.<br /><br />Having begun with Sharpe's Tiger, it seems to me to be the best place to start - introducing the reader to Sharpe himself, the execrable Obadiah Hakeswill, Mr. Lawford, and Wellington.  It is interesting to see how Cornwell starts to lose track of certain details as the novels skip around in time, but he's written so much that it is certainly hard to keep track of everything.<br /><br />I have a sneaking suspicion that Bernard Cornwell is another nom-de-plume for Stephen King, given the prolixity of his work and the none-too-subtle repetitive patterns of each book. I won't know for sure until Richard Sharpe comes out in favor of abortion and against nuclear energy.  If the authors are one and the same, then Mr. King has found another way to extract my hard earned money.<br /><br />Anyway - great entertainment!  But the kind of books that make me wonder why I don't just get a library card.	2005-10-13

Not only is it entertaining, but it appeals to a wide variety of audiences.  My students love to find out what is going to happen to Bradley Chalkers next!  I especially like the fact this book seems to draw in students who normally could care less about any book.  It is written from a child's point of view.  I also like the honest portrayal of childhood and elementary school.  The characters in this book have real feelings and emotions.<br /><br />  The best part of this book is that many of my students who have their own \\"issues\\" have really seemed to identify with Bradley.  I have a child in my room that is much like Bradley, and this has become such a favorite for him that he has asked me if he could buy my copy of the book.  This is from a child who doesn't even enjoy reading!<br /><br />  For those who feel that some of the subject matter is inappropriate for the age group, I suggest that they reexamine their rose colored view of childhood.  Many of our children do not live in ivory towers--I find Sachar's honest view of the elementary climate to be refreshing.  I would recommend this book to anyone.	2005-10-13

I found that place of manifesting, when reading this book-- just for a few days, but it was incredible.  I just looked out and into myself for the power, not UP, and spoke the the words of what I wished. It was there! Boom. Happened.  The ideas and methods in this book work. It is my $6800 book.  <br />  <br />The method I used is not available to everyone. And some might dismiss it as a fluke or luck. I know it was neither. It was too extraordinary.  No accident, because I literally thought of the book, Wake Up, It's Time To Remember, then called it forth.   <br />  <br />I'd leased my business. It was a leaky row boat, but got me out of there at a crucial time, when I was very depressed. The guy really burned me, and when I had to come back I was devastated and so in debt. It was a struggle. I had insurances coming due that had to be paid and several other huge outlays of money payable. The list was long and seemed no way I would get through it.  <br /> <br />We have gaming machines in Nevada and I was reading Wake Up, It's Time to Remember. Gambling is not something I would recommend, because it is a serious trap, but I just looked at that machine and knew that I would have the money, so it wasn't even really gambling. I went into a zone of absolute knowing and just called forth the results. I hit four other machines in a row for a total of $6800. <br /> <br />Do I recommend the book? You \\"bet\\" I do! This book is about winning in life, not just about money.  Abundance comes from hedging the bet. The author understands these principles so well, there is no need of beating around the bush. This book demonstrates how to do that in a dramatic narrative that is easy to apply.  <br />Acara Kaes <br />	2005-10-13

I expected to read about the lives of the women who were in the \\"hand-picked\\" bookclub in Iran, and how they may have used literature to overcame the struggles faced by women in the middle-east.    Instead, the book is more a memoir of the author's life. The many friends, co-wokers, family and women she writes about remind me of someone discussing their trophies.  She proves over and over again that her NEED to teach is more to force her own narcassic viewpoints rather than encouraging students to draw their own conclusions.  How sad for those studying under her.        Although the book touches on the lives of the members of the group, the author spends much of her time sharing personal stories of what it was like for her during her years as a rebellious, demonstrating young college woman NOT IN THE MIDDLE EAST, BUT IN THE UNITED STATES while attending college. Instead of blending the use of various great literature pieces into the story to show how the women used such works as \\"Lolita\\" to help them cope with their lives, she ran on and on and on with excerpts from various works, and did not relate them to current problems in the Middle East.       I felt at times the author was using this book as a means for her to come to terms with herself and how her own life had changed rather than enlighten the public of the struggles in the Middle East.        If someone has little knowledge of the struggles of women who are opressed in the Middle East,then you may enjoy this book.  If you, however have a general knowledge from other books, then I am almost certain you will find this book long, drawn out and boring.	2005-10-13

This book is an answer to a question many people have been avoiding all their lives.  And when you finally develop the ability to ask it to yourself, Sartre provides his suggested answer for you, though it may not be the answer you wanted.<br /><br />The premise of the main play, \\"No Exit\\", is that many people have chosen to exist in misery, even when the exit to that misery presents itself clearly.  For these people, there is \\"no exit\\".  Their existance is defined by their misery.  If they make the concious decision to exit, then they have nothing to live for.<br /><br />All four plays are written in non-pretentious and easy to understand styles, unlike many philisophical writings.  They don't require a great deal of effort to read or understand.  In fact, they are quite enjoyable and I found myself reading each play many times before moving on to the next one.<br /><br />Don't expect to feel uplifted about the state of humanity while reading these plays, however.  Sartre's message about human existance can be a dismal one.  It is quite helpful, though, to come to terms with the fact that many of our fellow humans are just puzzled about their lives, and sharing a social existance with these people can be precarious to your own search for meaning.	2005-10-13

In this case, from the cover illustration and title, I knew that Tony Johnston's picture book; THE HARMONICA would be such a read.  Inspired by the true story of Henryk Rosmaryn, this picture book takes readers on a journey through the nightmare of the Holocaust.<br /><br />The story itself is poignant, painful and full of the hope that human beings find in the worst of times.  Our narrator is a young boy with the gift of music who lives in Poland.  Despite their poverty, his father acquires a harmonica for him.  But this joyous time is short lived when the Nazi's arrive, tearing his parents away and sending him off to live in a concentration camp.  A commandant hears him playing Schubert on the harmonica one night and demands the boy to play for him every night in exchange for bread.  Ultimately, the boy finds strength through his playing and realizes it is a way to give his fellow prisoners hope in the darkness.  There are, of course, many books on this subject-many good books.  I think I can safely say this joins their ranks.  Ms. Johnston's simple, lyrical text is both poetic and harsh in its narration.  That is evident from the opening lines \\"I cannot remember my father's face, or my mother's, but I remember their love, warm and enfolding as a song.\\"  The text never falters, and never becomes overwrought.  With a large font, and only a few lines per page, the story unfolds more like a poem than a straight narrative.<br /><br />This is illustrator Ron Mazellan's first children's book, and it is a stunning achievement.  With a mixture of art mediums, the images come to life in rich color and texture.  Characters are drawn in high detail while the backgrounds are more sparse and indistinct giving the entire story a slightly dream-like quality, which goes well with Johnston's lyrical text.  In the earlier, happier pictures, the images are a wash of warm golds and browns.  As the Nazi's encroach up on the picture, the washes turn to grays, and purples and blues.  And then the warmth begins the come back in as he remembers his family and embraces the music.  So much of the story is conveyed by the emotion in these pictures, that a reader can take a long time studying a single image before turning the page. At the very back of the book, there is a note that this book was inspired by the true story of Henryk Rosmaryn who survived the hardships of the concentration camps and made his way to the United States, where he continued to play his harmonica to inspire others.<br /><br />This is not a story for a young child.  Picture books are not always for beginning readers or toddlers, this story is not happy, and while there is a positive message within the music, there is no satisfactory conclusion for a youngster.  There is no happy reunion for the boy and his family; there is no come-uppence for the violent commandant.  The book does not offer resolutions or reassurance.  For a child who is learning about the Holocaust, however, this may be one of the books to introduce them to.  It has a young narrator for them to identify with and some powerful messages to share.  And while it is dark and grim, the book is not grisly.  Everything is shown through the eyes of the main narrator.  Be prepared to spend some time discussing this book and the events that inspired it.  This is a beautiful and powerful book, but it does have an appropriate time and place for a child to discover it.<br /><br />For those who love THE HARMONICA, I would recommend the picture books ONE YELLOW DAFFODIL by  David A. Adler and THE SECRET SEDER by Doreen Rappaport.<br /><br />Good Reading! Shanshad ^_^warm golds and browns.

I first came upon employer/employee conflict resolution here in the US as a recently appointed  manager in New Jersey. An employee had voluntarily left in the face of discovery of some major rule violation and was disputing the denial of employment benefit. We both showed up at a dingy little office in Dover NJ and waited until the adjudicating officer was ready. This was a rather intimidating woman who exuded authority and made it clear that she was in charge and we must follow procedures. Each side presented their case, could question the other side's account and she would determine the outcome to be notified in the mail within a period of time. No lawyers, no bureaucratic paperwork, relatively quick decision. The facts were on my side with my concise and appropriate documentation. The pther party was denied.<br /><br />Contrast the situation in Britain, a rather lighter regulated workforce than the European but heavily regulated in comparison to America. Since the time of writing the book, lanour market regulation has increased although the European Commission President has stated that he wishes to reduce the volume of regulations generated by the European Union.<br /><br />Shackleton traces the creation, youth and developing adult story of employment tribunals a quasi-legal system established to deal with the disputes between employer and employee without trampling the well worn path to litigation so prevalent here in the United States. He clearly articulates a reform path by judiciously examining the pros and cons of the system as one would expect a prominent labour economist of his calibre to do. He looks at some alternatives and the Blair government's attempts to reform the system, simplify it and make it cheaper. He outlines a case for reform and rejects radical reform as being more difficult than the Thatcher union reforms of the 1980's.<br /><br />Shackleton makes the salient point that tribunals tend to be more concerned about employess and their grievances rather than the bigger picture of affecting the costs of labour to employers in the market place. It is a crucial point which is often overlooked. Whereas other costs are also added by the impact of bodies such as the Commission for Racial Equality, this impact is usually overlooked by the broader population.<br /><br />The regulation of the labour market is not, per se, something that any person would fundamentally object to. In the eyes of the dominant ideology people find fulfillment in their work. Yet one would think that these two things would be understood together and not as individual concerns. The plain fact is that too much regulation raises the costs of employers and reduces their competitiveness, leading to the loss of business and the accompanying jobs. Of course employers can respond with more labour saving capital investment which reduces the market for less skilled workers and increases marginally the demand for high skilled workers. In today's world, the post-industrialised west faces growing competition from Eastern European, Indian and Chinese economies who have the great advantage of comparatively lower paid, but relatively highly educated workforces to rely on.<br /><br />Shackleton's point is one that is being ignored at our peril, to a lesser extent in the UK than in other countries such as France. In the global economy, the competitive advantage is eroded by the businesses with the best response. Protection is increasingly less of an option than it appears. Impenetrable walls can disappear quicker than they were constructed.<br /><br />For whatever reason Shackleton argues that the case for radical reform would face tough resistance, society should look at what is politically impossible. The case for real radical reform and widespread labour market deregulation is unassailable. The consequences of continued protectionism will be wholescale loss of markets and jobs that cannot be easily won back.<br /><br />We all want better workplace. Weall want more holidays, more pay, better treatment or subsidised mortgages but we can only have those things if the businesses we work for can compete effectively in the global marketplace and consistently be successful. Even the mighty General Motors cannot live on past glories alone. All politicians should consider the arguments that Shackleton has marshalled here and act accordingly.

I have the revised edition of this book, and I cannot understand how this author can claim to be a \\"historian\\" and get so much of the history wrong.  For instance, the Grimes Sisters story, Ms. Bielski states that \\"the police investigated a second confession, that of Silas Jane, a skid row transient who was believed to have been involved in a a string of murders in Chicago\\"  Silas Jayne (correct spelling) was a millionaire horse breeder, which is a far cry from being a skid row transient.  There was a 22 year old transient who worked for Silas Jayne by the name of Kenneth Hansen who is believed to have murdered the Schuessler/Peterson boys, but he was a homosexual pedophile, so with his attraction to young boys, it is doubtful that he committed the Grimes murders. <br />Also in the very same story, Bielski claims that another suspect, Mr. Benny Bedwell \\"disappeared for all purposes from the face of the earth\\", that is also not true. For awhile, Mr. Bedwell was a fugutive, but was arrested on a warrant from Florida for the rape of a 13 year-old girl. The crime he was charged with in Florida closely resembled the one that took the lives of the Grimes sisters but he managed to avoid conviction for it, thanks to the passage of time while he was a fugitive. According to reports, Bedwell's accuser had been held captive for three days before escaping and notifying the police of her abduction and rape. Bedwell later spent time in prison on a weapons charge and died at some point after he was released in 1986.  <br />If you have more than one discrepancy per story, how is any of the book to be taken seriously?	2005-10-13

Ryder expands on his 2004 Season Guide, which was published before the season, including more in depth descriptions of the tracks, bikes, riders and teams and also adds long, detailed descriptions of every race and the entire championship; all this combined with beautiful photography throughout the book make it a real winner. Ryder's unique insider position in MotoGP gives him the opportunity to pass on nuggets of knowledge that aren't commonly found everywhere else, so the book an invaluable addition to any MotoGP fans library.	2005-10-13

After claiming that he would never return to fiction after \\"Timequake\\" in 1997 and stating that he was trough with writing not long after that, Mr. Vonnegut returns with his Fourth collection of autobiographical essays, anecdotes and quips (Palm Sunday, Wampeters Foma and Granfalloons, and Fates Worse Than Death).  <br /> <br />Mr. Vonnegut displays his irreverent charm as well as he always has, but it doesn't seem to ring as loudly as it once did. This self-proclaimed luddite seems stuck in a state of Arrested Development that has his writing dark and comical as ever, but \\"same as it ever was\\" as well. <br /> <br />Having heard Vonnegut speak two years ago at the University of Wisconsin (a speech which is included in this collection) I felt as though Vonnegut could go out on the top of his game, tip his hat a few times and fade off into the sunset--sadly we are left with a \\"fade\\" altogether different--this volume is certainly worth the price of admission to the die-hard collector, but previous volumes of autobiographical pieces and essays are certainly meatier and, frankly, more quintessentially \\"Vonnegutian.\\"	2005-10-13

The sheer scope of the book is absolutely bananas. B A N A N A S! <br />With that said, ahem. <br />I ended up picking up this book on a whim when meandering through the book store and brought it home, half expecting to never finish it, just to PRETEND to read it to show how people how deep I am. But alas, when I read it, well, let's just say I might ACTUALLY be deep now.  <br />The first half of the beast of a work is pretty much everything Guy and the science community already knows about life. All life in all worlds as he so eloquently puts it. But what's fun for you and I and the reader is that we don't know much about life. Sure, we know about TV and... TV stars, but we don't know about the amazing feats of the average hook worm, paramecium or even our closests relative, the salamander. Or the chimp. All jokes aside, some of this stuff will literally blow your mind. You will constantly find yourself reading snippets to your friends, or doing further research on certain subjects on the internet. <br />After concluding the psuedo-biology lesson, along with some psych thrown in for good measure, he gets to the real meat and potatoes of the book: <br />The Seven Mysteries of Life <br />Topics such as superorganisms, divinity, tracendence, dimensions and other, well for lack of a better word, mysteries make for a very heavy read. And in this case, a very good kind of heavy.  <br />If you think you think outside the box, read this book. You might finally find what's outside of that. <br />	2005-10-13

Liungman's explanations of their origin and uses. Browsing the pages is rewarding for the artist looking for inspiration. There is plenty of it -- the book contains some 1,600 articles, and an additional 100 pages with essays on ubiquitous/especially interesting signs or sign systems (such as the Mystical Pentagram, or the signs of the Alchemists). <br /> <br />The explanations are usually to the point, although I find that Liungman occasionally strays too far away from the subject at hand. The sections about the astrological systems of signs are particularly abundant in information, and would have gained from being more carefully edited. The selection of signs, however, is excellent; it even includes modern ideograms from the Internet age, such as the At sign. <br /> <br />Symbols -- Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms really excels when it comes to searching for signs that the reader does not yet know the name of. Using a taxonomy scheme of his own, Liungman has classified the signs into 54 distinctive groups. The reader can navigate to any of the groups simply by describing the sign in terms of \\"Crossing lines/Not crossing lines\\", \\"Single-axis symmetric/Asymmetric\\" and so on. A quick glance at the right group overview page is all it takes to find the right match. <br /> <br />This book is highly recommended.	2005-10-13

In The Disciplined Mind, he takes those concepts and combines them to define a minimum educational standard:  Introducing students to the thought processes of major disciplines to appreciate important issues from the perspective of multiple intelligences.<br /><br />To exemplify the point, Professor Gardner develops examples of his concept involving Darwin's Finches (as a window on evolutionary thinking), one scene from The Marriage of Figaro by Mozart (as a window onto social commentary and music) and the Wannsee Conference in Nazi Germany (as a window onto the banal evil of the Holocaust).  He sees the fundamental questions that education should address as following into the subjects of truth, beauty and goodness (or good versus evil) which these three examples epitomize.<br /><br />Those sections were great fun, but the most valuable part of the book comes in chapter 10 where he addresses \\"Getting There\\".  It's a marvelous description of how to create positive organizational change within education.  Professor Gardner gets tough in pointing out that good leadership is essential.  Otherwise, multidisciplinary means just messing around with whatever appeals to you . . . and not learning a darn thing of lasting importance.<br /><br />I can relate to that point.  One of my first college courses was intended to teach us the historical discipline by working with primary sources about the Entresol Club in France before the Revolution.  But the case didn't really work for that purpose and the leadership was muddled.  The only thing I learned was the entresol was the floor above the ground floor in a French building.  That has helped me in elevators several times since then.  But I had to learn the historical discipline elsewhere.<br /><br />He points out several key lessons:<br /><br />Have a long-term perspective<br /><br />Be flexible and seek small victories<br /><br />Anticipate setbacks and be prepared for them<br /><br />Allow time for reflection<br /><br />Build on strengths<br /><br />Pay attention to implicit messages in the institutional culture<br /><br />Create a community that cares<br /><br />Visit and be visited<br /><br />Cultivate new energies<br /><br />Commit yourself to the process of change<br /><br />I was reminded of Peter Senge's excellent book, The Dance of Change, as I read this section.<br /><br />The next best part of the book came in chapter 9 where Professor Gardner explained how multiple intelligences can be brought to bear for understanding.<br /><br />This material is a classic for introducing any important subject:<br /><br />1.  Provide powerful points of entry that engage students.<br /><br />2.  Offer apt analogies to make the material accessible.<br /><br />3.  Deliver multiple representations of the core ideas of the topic that capture each of the multiple intelligences.<br /><br />Many of the people who have been honored with the MacArthur Prize Fellowship (the so-called Genius award) fail to impress me as being geniuses.  Professor Gardner is the happy exception to that observation.  This book is a marvelous summation of his perspective and how to bridge the unsatisfying gap between classical \\"memorize everything\\" education to produce the \\"whole person\\" and the pressure now to produce highly functional \\"specialists\\" who are ignorant outside their specialties.<br /><br />Bravo, Professor Gardner!<br /> <br />He points out several key lessons: <br /> <br />Have a long-term perspective <br />Be flexible and seek small victories <br />Anticipate setbacks and be prepared for them <br />Allow time for reflection <br />Build on strengths <br />Pay attention to implicit messages in the institutional culture <br />Create a community that cares <br />Visit and be visited <br />Cultivate new energies <br />Commit yourself to the process of change <br /> <br />I was reminded of Peter Senge's excellent book, The Dance of Change, as I read this section.   <br /> <br />The next best part of the book came in chapter 9 where Professor Gardner explained how multiple intelligences can be brought to bear for understanding. <br /> <br />This material is a classic for introducing any important subject: <br /> <br />1.

I'm in agreement with some of the other's who've reviewed this book here. I don't think it's very useful to someone like me who's been playing the game since the mid 80s, but this book has its charm, and it is very useful for the highschool kid who's been stuck with the task of DMing for the first time and needs some advice. Sure, there are useful section on cities, NPCs, prestige class creation, etc, but the bulk of the book is an aid for those who need to hone their Dming skills. I'll admit, it made reassess my own style as I read it. One thing I found to be really important about this book is that it specifically states, several times, that you don't have to DM one specific way, that FUN is the goal. It's all about putting the FUN back into the game. It tells those of us, who've become set in our ways, to step back and ask ourselves if our players are enjoying the games we run. This is one of few DnD books of late that hasn't been choke full of prestige classes, feats, spells and other fluff. I recommend it to everyone if for no other reason that it makes you think, instead of offering you a pile of junk your players will get pumped on and you'll have to find a way to incorporate in your game.	2005-10-13

This book clearly points a way to gain that edge by differentiating my offerings from a large majority of my competitors. I've often thought that most photographs used in e-bay marketing are mediocre, at best, my own included. When I see a good e-bay photographic presentation, I recognize the selling power that it represents, but I have rarely accomplished it myself. Sinclair and Livingston have produced a terrific book. If you read it and apply the material, almost anyone (including me) can produce \\"above average\\" photographs for their e-bay marketing. The book is a quick-read, but provides an excellent reference souce for later application of the material it contains. I've read a couple other e-bay books by Joe Sinclair and one thing I like about all these books is that they have a nice clean easy-to-read layout. Each chapter in this book has substantial stand-alone value. A chapter that may be a trinket to you might be a treasure to me, and vice versa. In total, however, the book will have great value to any serious e-bay marketer. If \\"a picture is worth a thousand words\\", then several very good pictures make a powerful e-bay sales presentaion, indeed. My conclusion ... a great book, complete, perfect for practical application.	2005-10-13

I bought this book two days after the death of my firstborn child on September 26, 2005.  Our daughter was stillborn at 24 weeks.  By the time I opened the first page, I was in tears.  The picture of the angel carrying the baby to heaven made me think of my daughter.  The whole book made me feel a sense of peace knowing my daughter is in such a beautiful and wonderful place.  I read this book everyday so I can rest assured that she is safe in heaven and waiting on me to get there so we can be together again.  The illustrations are beautiful and very lifelike.  Sometimes I feel that my daughter is actually reading the book to me and sending me a message that she is alright and for me not to cry over her death all the time.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel a little more at ease about where their baby is.

Similarly on page 24, Royal Melbouren GC hole No. 1, no picture but two close ups of golf pro's. <br /> <br />Los Angeles Country Club Nth Course, 3 holes , no pictures. <br /> <br />National Golf Club, Moonah course, 6 holes, not one picture. <br /> <br />Additionally, the structure of the book is poor as it should have depicted every golf course by hole in alphabetical order. Ie start with Aa Saint-Omer GC pg 1 and finish with Zaudin Golf Club on page 952. <br /> <br />Instead they have decided to chapterize the book from chapter 1 (1st Hole) through to the 18th chapter (18th hole) and fill each chapter with different holes from different clubs. If I want to see the holes of Spyglass Hill  GC I Have to go to pgs. 44, 70, 164 and 648.  <br /> <br />Great concept for a book but dissapointing in its design and structure. <br /> <br />Peter Montgomery - Australia	2005-10-13

Radcliffe's broad view is shaped by his study of Catholic Tradition, sustained encounter with Christ throught prayer and Scripture, and experience with the world wide Church---from his role as leader of the Dominicans.  That view helps the reader see a way to be a Church member with a sense of perspective.   We have be through much before our particular time and will go through much after us.   It also puts being loving ahead of being right---not replacing it, but making it the priority.    His book models a good balanve of intellectual curiosity and faith.   I recommend the book highly.	2005-10-13

Deborah Dolen, the Author, really laid it out and made it fun and easy. She also makes it clear where to buy real values to save money and has current sources. The others had old no longer around sources. Her DVD that comes with it is awesome.

Yes,and  <br />so is Warren because he sits on the fence between free will and <br />robotic controll from above.I found the book to be depressing,because it leads to nowhere and the arguement goes around in circles.Another troubling thing about the book is  <br />the feeling that you are the center of the universe and all other people bounce off of you so you can have your experience. <br />Sounds new age almost.To make a long story short  Warren  <br />comes across as someone who uses subjective fluffy 'feel good' <br />thinking and tries to make it an objective reality for all people,just doesn't work.	2005-10-13

The characters were interesting, the place was interesting. <br /> <br />But I found the drastic change in the self-centred Will Avery unbelievable, and everyone gets a romantic partner a bit too 'pat'. I feel the book would have been more compelling if there was just one pair of lead characters instead of so many kind of equally distributed in importance. It's as if Hoffman has tried to achieve too much in too few pages. <br /> <br />I felt sorry for Rebecca Sparrow, but didn't find her crucial enough to play such a strong role in the story. There are also a lot of unanswered questions and blurriness--when Stella sees a horse as a cause of death for Hap, why is the reality the *word* \\"sea horse\\"? Jenny starts off by holding our interest but then Stella grabs our attention, and then Elinor, then Dr Stewart, and on and on. <br /> <br />They were all interesting, but I think a longer book with the story fleshed out better would have made this a 5star book. <br />	2005-10-13

The story can be classified as a prequel to Bova's grand tour series and follows struggling industrialist Dan Randolph as he attempts to build a solar power satellite with a view to making the USA independent of that nasty Opec energy cartel.  On the way he has to battle evil terrorists and has an on again/off again romance with the wife of an aspiring US presidential candidate. <br /> <br />Everything about this novel is simplistic.  While solar power satellites may play a role in energy production some day I don't see it being any time soon, the main problem being the enormous startup cost which is currently beyond national governments, let alone one small company.  The characters in the novel are the usual Bova stereotypes and I took some offence at the politics too.  Only the bad side of the Arab world is ever alluded to. It seems that struggling American capitalists are the only good people in this world and there even seems to be a dig at the Russians too. <br /> <br />Powersat, however, is not really a bad book if you accept it for what it is.  It's just a lightweight yarn about the near future that would be good for reading on a plane trip.  If you aren't expecting a work of literature then you will probably enjoy it.	2005-10-13

Edwards investigates Reagan's childhood, his leadership qualities and his accomplishments with keen insight and understanding.<br /><br />The narrative concentrates on those people, events and circumstances that shaped the great man's character and career path, from his childhood and student days through his movie career, his two stints as governor of California and his presidency.<br /><br />Both the failures and the great and enduring successes of the Reagan administration are covered. For example, Edwards looks at the Iran-Contra debacle as well as the economic miracle, the benefits of deregulation and the West's victory in the Cold War.<br /><br />A highlight of the book is Edwards' analyses of the four essential qualities of leadership that Reagan possessed: courage, justice, prudence and wisdom. The author points out how these qualities came into play at various occasions in Reagan's life and career.<br /><br />He discusses the books that helped persuade Reagan to change his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican and in the bibliographical essay at the end, he reviews the best and the worst books on the 40th President. The Essential Ronald Reagan concludes with copious notes and a thorough index.<br /><br />I also recommend the books [[ASIN:0142001686 When Character Was King: A Story of Ronald Reagan]] by Peggy Noonan, [[ASIN:0684848236 Ronald Reagan: How an Ordinary Man Became an Extraordinary Leader]] by Dinesh D'Souza and [[ASIN:0789479923 Ronald Reagan: An American Hero]], with an introduction by William F Buckley.

I've read it twice in 24 hours and I'm starting on it for the third time right now.  I've never really heard the story of Beauty and the Beast, except of course the old Disney animated film.  After I read Beauty I read other versions of Beauty and the Beast, but they didn't even come close.  Beauty goes indepth with the girls time at the castle and how she gets to know the Beast.  This isn't just your average fairytale, it was like a romance to me.  We'll yah Cinderella, Snow White, and all those other stories could be condsidered romances too, but not in the same sense.  In all the other storeis they fall in love at first sight and all that other gooy stuff.  But Beauty was actually believeable and it just really knocked me off my feet.  In some other versions for example, the charcters have no depth.  You know, oh Beauty, and he's a Beast, got it.  In Beauty though the charcters come alive and seem like real people and go beyond the limits of an average fairy tale.  What also bothers me is in the Disney version Beast is mean and selfish bascially until Gaston gets there and stabs him.  Then when he turns into the Prince, he seems like an entirely different person.  For this book I could tell that Beast and the Prince were the same people.  This was the first book I've read by Robin McKinley, and it certainly won't be the only one now, after of course, I read this one another ten times or so.  If you haven't read this book you're missing out on a lot, and currently so am I, because I'm not busy reading it!	2005-10-13

Nobody visits Goldstone for pleasure, it's a place people go when there's nowhere else to go. But Maggie needs Brax. She's sure her husband Carl is having an affair and wants Brax to investigate.<br /><br />Brax's snooping leads to more questions than answers. For example, why is Carl exchanging e-mails with Simone Chandler, internet erotica author? Although Brax finds Simone deliciously desirable, he is still suspicious of her. Why is she living in Goldstone and why is she e-mailing his sister's husband? Brax wants to learn more about Simone, a lot more. But before he can, Carl is found murdered!<br /><br />I love a heroine I can relate to.  Simone is easy to connect with and immensely likable. She is voluptuous, smart, has a domineering mother, a fun sense of humor, and has lived<br /><br />through failure to try again. That Brax should find her fascinating is a given. Brax has known failure too, which makes him lovable but strong. He's clever, handsome, funny and<br /><br />very diplomatic. Their interaction is funny and sexy.<br /><br />Readers will enjoy Brax and Simone's love story but they will also be intrigued by Carl's activities, and later the mystery of his murder. Jennifer Skully has written Fool's Gold with<br /><br />plenty of plot twists and turns to keep the reader on edge wondering who the murderer could be.

The character development didn't make sense; Poole shouldn't have prtrayed Jovan's man as being so loyal in every sense then having him trick at the end. Poole tried to hard to have the novel full of twists, his desire for a surpise ending resulted in characters completley contradicting themselves.   <br /> <br />It was a quick read like all Triple Crown books, but it lacked depth. Yes I enjoyed it, but no I wouldn't pay 15 dollars check it out from the library. The writing style was nothing to rave about; it was simple and plain written.   <br /> <br />The most frusturating thing was the grammatical errors.  Is it that hard to proofread a book?  Does Triple Crown not know what a publisher's job entails?  By reading the book one time I picked up well over thirty errors.

Of the generation of great American writers who reshaped our language, he was a lively fully engaged fellow and not prisoner of any ivory tower, despite his peerless credentials.  Line by line, stanza by stanza, it shows.  The Comedy requires many talents and understanding life and people is not the least of them.<br /><br />\\"Dante was a drummer,\\" Ciardi aptly notes in his introduction, and Ciardi's meter and rhyme scheme give a good English facsimile of Dante's incessant, intoxicating drum beat -- his famous 11 beat terza rima.  You simply cannot do it in English, where most words end in hard consonants, not open vowels as in Italian.  Yeah some people have tried -- always a noble aim -- but unless you're Superman don't climb Everest without oxygen.  Purism will never get most of us through a first reading of this poem or for that matter through a few readings after.  Music is what you need and Ciardi expertly lays it down.<br /><br />About the poem?  I've read it 7 times through, in different translations (Ciardi thrice) over 40 years and am just getting started.  I do Ciardi between the others because I love my good modern Yankee language, soon drown without it.  Ciardi really understands it -- from the jive of the street punk to the most austere scholar or saint -- its all here -- Dante's whole world talking to you like everybody you ever met.	2005-10-13

Pretty much the same book as Melissa Bank's earlier novel \\"Girls Guide to Hunting and Fishing\\", only with the names changed. So if you liked that one, you will probably enjoy this -- otherwise, it's pretty dull stuff. Ms. Bank is a witty writer, who occasionally seems to be enjoying her own wit too much...sort of like someone laughing at their own jokes. Funny to them, maybe sort of redundant to us. <br /> <br />When an author reworks the same characters and situations more than once, the suspicion arises that she is simply writing about her own life but changing the names. I don't know much of anything about Ms. Bank, but if she is indeed a non-practicing Jew from the suburbs of Philadelphia and worked during her post-college years as an editorial assistant in Manhattan...well, let's just say I would not be shocked. I'll bet she had a prestigious dad (doctor/judge), a stay-at-home mom, hyper-critical grandmother, lady-killer brother and lots and lots and lots of dreary, neurotic, dead-end romantic entanglements. <br /> <br />Just like \\"Girl's Guide\\", \\"Wonder Spot\\" is arranged in a series of short stories of varying length. Of course, they are all about the protagonist (Sophie Applebaum...could we be laying the Jewish thing on any thicker than the choice of this name?), a neurotic, self-pitying slacker with no particular strong opinons or ideas or goals in life...she merely drifts from school to job, and man to man...often sabotaging any possible happiness by repeatedly making lame, inexplicable choices (oversleeping and coming into work late, dumping nice guys but relentless pursuing jerky losers). At the end of the book, we find her at 37 or so, dating a guy in his 20s (good luck there)and pretty much still drifting. Along the way, numerous characters and introduced and discarded without informing the reader -- suddenly, in the second last story, we hear that Sophie had a fiance (!) who was killed in a car crash. Before that, one story ends with her deeply involved with a serious and loving Dr. boyfriend. Next story, he's disappeared without mention of what happened to him. <br /> <br />This is simply poor writing and structure. If Ms. Banks, like her characters, worked in publishing, she didn't learn much about editing and discipline. A novel is more than a series of witty quips, or a character who carps relentlessly about her situation. <br /> <br />It's also possible, even admirable, to try and write about something outside of your personal, individual experience. There are other jobs besides those in publishing, other cultural upbringings besides that of \\"non-practicing Jew\\", and other places to live besides Manhattan. (Just for the record, entirely too many books and movies today are set in either Manhattan or Los Angeles...someone from 200 years in the future, reading late 20th cent. literature would be likely to think that 80% of the US population lived in either of those two places, which is obviously untrue.) I know that creative writing teachers often tell students to \\"write about what you know\\", but in this case Melissa Bank is taking that advice far too literally. She has talent and humor, but is as reluctant to take the next step into decisive, imaginative work as her characters are to commit to relationships. <br /> <br />(BTW: for the record, Curtis Sittenfeld's review of \\"Wonder Spot\\" in the NYTimes Review of Books -- which is referenced in the Melissa Bank interview here on Amazon.com -- was NOT a take-down in any way...if anything, it was a kind and respectful review, but honest, and if she calls the book \\"chick-lit\\", she was not remotely off-base.)	2005-10-13

With the publication of \\"The da Vinci Code,\\" a substantial corollary of publishing flotsam and jetsam has spread, encompassing \\"The Name of the Rose\\", and \\"Foucault's Pendulum\\" among other worthwhile enterprises. Martin Gardiner inspired this auxiliary niche much earlier with his magnificent tomes deconstructing the Dodson oeuvre. Even Samuel Clemens has his explainers establishing that decoding Grimm is grim indeed.<br /><br />Hence, this book is a handy reference to seeing which real life Karlas were confabulating into Littell's Starik (Old Man). Littell derived the title from Jan Berzin, p.201, the successor to Feliks Dzerzhinsky, the original landlord of Lubyanka. Starik's Lolita propensities, which Littell uses as a recurring obsessive liet motif, were derived from Beria, who \\"could indulge his vices, the chief one of which was little girls. Beria had little girls kidnapped all over Moscow; they were taken to his luxurious dacha, where he raped them.\\" P. 214.<br /><br />Littell used Marcus Wolfe to demonstrate the unknown quality of Starik, the superspy model for Le Carre's Karla in the Smiley sagas, p. 177, and of course, Jack J. McAuliffe, is James Bond, ala Ian Fleming, in real life Dusko (not the ill-fated Pyotr, p.35, who suffered a furnace fire execution) Popov[e], pp. 98-102.<br /><br />Ernest Volkman, a prize-winning former national correspondent for Newsday, spices up this book by pointing out that Giovanni Montini was a praised and prize covert asset for the CIA before he was elected Pope Paul VI and was nominated for sainthood recognition by John Paul II who was overt except for the covert funding of Solidarity, p. 276.<br /><br />Volkman does not resolve the still unanswered question as to whether Jesus Angleton was \\"Sasha\\" and used his devoted acolyte Golitsin to discredit Nosenko, who was tortured by Angleton, ala Littell's Leo Kritsky. However, Volkman's \\"Spies\\" was published in 1974, some eighteen years before Littell's \\"The Company\\" (2002).<br /><br />A two page update to Volkman, can be found in Freeh's not quite maxima mea culpa, \\"My FBI [Feebi]\\" (2005), which notes that Aldrich Ames was head of the firm's Soviet Branch of the Directorate of Operations in 1985, eleven years after Angleton was fired, whilst discussing Bob Hanssen and Earl Pitts. (\\"My FBI\\", at pp. 235 et seq.)<br /><br />All in all, \\"Spies\\" is still welcome to reference space on my overcrowded shelves.

Eberhart writes about roughly 150 towns that were once in existence (most had post offices at one time), all located along the I-25 corridor or east of there on the high plains. He gives a thorough historical account of each place and includes a hand-drawn map of the town's location, making it easy to see where each was exactly (this important element is missing in many ghost town books). In addition, there are many dozens of photographs, some contemporary, some historical, of many of the places described. One of the best books on the subject I've seen.

After some thought, Mr. Farrant decided that he would take on the task and he began to collect the ghost stories that would eventually form this book.<br /><br />Mr. Farrant has a superb writing style and he relates his stories with a great deal of enthusiasm. It is also obvious that he enjoys his subject and even more importantly that he respects his subject. There is nothing worse that a writer of ghost books who looks down on his subject matter or on those who read their books.  He also does a good job of relating the atmosphere of the Georgia coast, which is quite a feat for a transplanted Yankee like Mr. Farrant.<br /><br />There are several excellent stories to be found in this book. Stories that contain recent eyewitness accounts of haunts that are still in progress make up the majority of the chapters and those are the kinds of stories that make or break a book like this one. Even some of the stories about ghosts that seem to have gone away are of a recent enough nature that the author was able to interview people who had experienced the haunt while it was still active. Accounts like this need to be preserved and the Mr. Farrant has done an excellent job of doing just that.<br /><br />There are unfortunately, a few stories in this book that fall into the category of old legend and folklore and this book would have been much better if the author had decided to leave these stories out. For example, the stories of \\"The Legend of Ebo Landing\\" and \\"An Old St. Simons Ghost Story\\" were interesting but really had no place in this book. Fortunately though, these kinds of stories were few and far between. There are also a few typos in this book, which I hope will be corrected in future editions, and I hope that there are many printings of this excellent book.<br /><br />Don Farrant has put together a fine collection of haunting tales from an area that is woefully underrepresented in this genre of book and he is to be thanked for his efforts. There are a few weak points but not many and the author's ability as a storyteller is on a par with the best in the business.

Other readers seem to view her work as trite over-workshopped craftsmanship; it is precisely the qualities that they deride that make Ms. Williams' work stand out from the rest attempting to practice their craft today.  Rather than becoming self-absorbed with the thought of oneself as a \\"poet\\" while sinking headfirst into a miasma of hackneyed cliches, Ms. Williams explores the world of culture and ideas while at the same time offering exceptional style and imagery.  I was a contemporary of Ms. Williams' at UVA, though as a literary critic and not as a writer -- and have heard her read several times.  She is, without a doubt, one of the most impressive readers of poetry I have heard, perhaps only eclipsed by W.D. Snodgrass and Derek Walcott.  Judge for yourself -- if you are a student or lover of poetry, it is definitely worth you time to read this collection, and it should be available at almost any major university library.	2005-10-13

Of those who live there, 73 percent are black, 49 percent have graduated from high school and almost all -- 98 percent -- are renters.  It encompasses Detroit's biggest drug houses, the most hookers, the best Chinese restaurant, the world's largest Masonic Temple (where we used to go see performances of the Metropolitan Opera on Tour), and a gaggle of Wayne State University students who want to live close to campus and are too poor to look elsewhere.  If you stand out in the middle of Second Avenue, a street that runs right through the Corridor (careful, you might get solicited by a cruising john), and look north, you will see what one local radio station insists on calling the 'Golden Tower' of the Fisher Building.<br /><br />This book is about a single murder in 1984 that stood out amongst Detroit's 600+ murders that year because of its brutality, and because of the odd character of the victim, who was a successful psychologist and marital counselor.<br /><br />The murder itself is an anti-climax and occurs near the end of the book.  There is no mystery about who is going to kill whom.  The meat of \\"Masquerade\\" lies in the interactions between pimp, hooker, and sugar daddy.  How did a psychologist with a thriving practice in the 'Golden Tower' of the Fisher Building and a six-bedroom, six-bathroom Tudor in Grosse Pointe Park become so involved with an ordinary streetwalker and her pimp, that he spent over $1,000/week on their drug habits?  How did he manage to keep his life in Cass Corridor a secret for over a year from his psychologist-wife?<br /><br />I can't remember the last time I read with such fascination about lethal relationships and the destruction they wrought on seemingly good marriages and friendships.  Everyone involved ended up with nightmares, even the jurors.<br /><br />Many chapters begin with an ironic quotation from the lectures and books of the murder victim or his psychologist-father.  Even though it isn't a whodunit, you're likely to form an obsessive-compulsive relationship with 'Masquerade' once you begin reading it.<br /><br />This book does sag a bit as it inches toward the murder, and it is depressing as hell to read, but I've already searched the internet to see if I can get another fix from this author.to keep his life in Cass Corridor a secret for over a year from his psychologist-wife?  <br /> <br />I can't remember the last time I read with such fascination about lethal relationships and the destruction they wrought on seemingly good marriages and friendships.

He derides the author for describing Fort Pillow as \\"crescent-shaped.\\" The reviewer scornfully claims that the fort was a shallow \\"w\\" in shape.   <br /> <br />If you google the term, \\"Fort Pillow\\" and \\"crescent,\\" guess what pops up? Among other things, a reproduction of Nathan Bedford Forrest's after action report about the capture of Fort Pillow.  Guess what the \\"Wizard of the Saddle\\" describes the fort as being shaped like?  Here's what he said in the report: <br /> <br />\\"The fort is an earth-work, crescent shaped, is 8 feet in height and 4 feet across the top, surrounded by a ditch 6 feet deep and 12 feet in width, walls sloping to the ditch but perpendicular inside.\\" <br /> <br />Personally, I would take the impression of the man who captured the place over any reviewer here.  I wonder what Forrest would have to say to him? (probably something memorably profane). <br /> <br />Now, let's talk about the endpaper map:  I've looked at it too.  First, it isn't that great a map.  If I had been the author, I would have found a better, clearer one.  But it doesn't show barracks or anything else in the Mississippi River! <br /> <br />I'm not saying this book is perfect, but people need to have a sense of proportion.  Does it really matter in a study on the massacre at Fort Pillow whether the author placed a statue of Andrew Jackson in the wrong city?  Getting the description of the fort wrong as the \\"one star\\" reviewer so clearly did is a worse error than something like that.   <br /> <br />The bit about the Army of Tennessee is a legitimate ding, but people ought to think about the odds that in a book that is 530 pages long, anyone could get all of the thousands of facts contained within it correct.   <br /> <br />As far as the idea that the book is some sort of hatchet job on Nathan Bedford Forrest, that is just that reviewer's interpretation.Forrest came up the hard way.  He was a slave trader, and I think one had to be pretty hard-minded to prosper at it the way he did.  He was also a military genius.  But he allowed the massacre at Fort Pillow to take place.  Does that mean he was monster?  No.  It just means that there's a shadow across his reputation --just like the role he played in setting up the KKK after the Civil War.	2005-10-13

This report first just ACCEPTS that something like this can just happen, without asking why and how, then it fails to adress the almost completely impossible manouvre flight 77 had to make to hit that specific empty piece of Pentagon, and then it simply ignores the fact that no airplane debris was found at the pentagon that even closely resembles a boeing 757.  <br />It further shows a computer-rendering of all of the World Trade Center buildings on page 284, from which you can already tell it would have been impossible for WT7 to have been destroyed by world trade center towers debris, and to collapse the way it did. The Commissions report says nothing about this. It simply fails to adress this issue.  <br />Actually, it is simply full of omissions, it does not answer to any questions it should have been answering at all. It is a well-written, exciting piece of nothing. Kinda like Harry Potter, very fun pulp.	2005-10-13

This SciFi novel presumes space travel that requires extensive time (many years) and cryogenics.  The colonists arrive somewhat before the book starts, discover the planet at which they have arrived is already inhabited, and send back a request for help.  Well, help finally arrives, long after it ceases to be needed.  But the \\"help\\" have goals of their own, which do not always coicide with the colonists desires.    I have three problems with this book, and it lost one star for each.  First, \\"City of Pearl\\" switches between three primary viewpoints, which writing strategy I seldom enjoy.  Second, the book takes a very strong stance against eating meat -- this isn't necessary to the plot in any way, the author just seems to abhor people who admit they are omnivores.  Third, the plotline depicts government, big business and humans in general as predominately being selfish and evil; wheras the colonists and aliens were predominately generous and good.      Personally, I found the above obnoxious and was unable to enjoy the rest of the book.  This is a shame, because \\"City of Pearl\\" has quite a lot to offer.  This is a creative SciFi novel with intriguing societal rules, and interesting metaphores comparing pregancy and/or abortion with ... well, you'll see.    \\"City of Pearl\\" is well written and creative.  Karen Traviss is a skilled author, and I look forward to reading another of her novels.	2005-10-13

Did we really need to have yet another public confessional of a private tragedy? Do we really need to be exposed to a dysfunctional family's internal workings? Do we really need to know that self-abosrbed Ms Hendra accuses her father of indecent behavior? No we don't. But that doesn't stop her from making the rounds on NPR or book signings or interviews. Private tragedy is money and notariety don't you know. <br /> <br />Never mind that if her father really did do the what she accuses him of she has a 12 year old half-sister whom she coldly refers to as \\"his other family\\". Jessica Hendra, so self-absorbed and possibly mentally ill (listen to her mannerisms during her interview on NPR), cares little about her own half-sister who, if her accusations are true, may herself be in danger. <br /> <br />Who knows what the truth is; Ms Hendra isn't quite \\"all there\\", dad won't admit it and now here we are let in on the problems of two very minor figures. Did it happen or did she feel betrayed when daddy got another family and carries the grudge throught here.

I am an obsessive fantasy football player who loved the idea that someone would \\"abandon a successful career to make fantasy football his full-time job.\\"  The possibilities are endless, but sadly Mark St. Amant just doesn't explore enough of them.  The man announces that winning his fantasy league is his absolute priority in life, but he doesn't buy himself NFL Sunday ticket, seems to travel on half the Sundays of the year and seemingly goes to bed in the 3rd quarter of Monday Night Football every week.  Give me a break.  What kind of commitment is that?   <br /> <br />If you've ever played fantasy football (even if you're terrible), don't expect to learn anything from this book, other than maybe the origins of the hobby (which are disputed and just aren't that interesting after all).  He has all the time in the world to concentrate on his team but he never pulls off a single interesting trade, can't come up with a team name that's even mildly humorous, and doesn't offer a single peice of advice that a new player wouldn't figure out in his first five weeks of playing. <br /> <br />Finally, Bill Simmons should get royalties for this book.  Many of the references are just shamelessly \\"borrowed\\" from ESPN's popular and infinitely funnier Sports Guy.  The O.C., Billy Zabka, Jame Gumb, gouging his own eyes out with frustration and the list goes on and on and on.  C'mon, Mark, get your own style. <br /> <br />I summary, the author wasted a great idea.  It's not insightful, there is no climax to speak of, and worst of all, it's just not funny.

It is very entertaining and well written with good atmosphere and lots of very good and clever dialogue. the plot is quite good overall and moves along well [ i never got bored, frustrated and fed up with this.. like i did with the recent poor 'Kern' tale] <br />The characters are interesting and mostly well done.  <br />My fave character is Fallon the tough, fiesty, sexy and impressive Cimmerian warrioress who is hotter than a big bread oven. can't wait for more of her. [she should get her own novel! ] <br /> <br />And there are some sexy scenes and various naked whores a-plenty for the guys. There are some impressive fights and clever ideas from the inventive writer York. his version of Stygia and the cult of Set is nicely done and well detailed, but i wanted it to be much more impressive, mysterious, and more terrifyingly horrific and evil? [but that's the dark horror fan in me. perhaps it will get more evil in the next 2 books? but i don't think that is his style?] <br /> <br />The magic /sorcery eventually featured in the Set cult and climax is very impressive and mega-powerful stuff. including various arcane magic items and awesome supernatural beings! [but it feels like too much power too soon for book 1 ?] <br /> <br />But the apparent major influence of gods and fate on Anok and the story is always an annoyance for me in any S+S books. and there are a few other 'silly and corny' bits that made me cringe a bit, but there are usually some in most fantasy books. <br /> <br />York writes with some spirit and flair, and i welcome and applaud his 1st exciting descent into the dark and fantastic bowels of Stygia. <br />i enjoyed this book for what it mostly is.. good entertaining pulp-style S+S with extra toppings of mega-sorcery. it makes me want to read the next book so its 'magic' is working on me. my thanks to J. S .YORK. <br />Rating = 7 /10. a good impressive start. [worth a read if you are a fan of Stygia and sorcery, or you are a secret worshipper of Set..]:) <br />[BTW, 7 is quite a good score from me. i am hard to please] <br />	2005-10-13

The Jewish scriptures (the Torah), which non-Jews refer to as the Old Testament, contains all the values upon which our legal system is based.

Like another reviewer said: it looks like a blueprint of the movie Clueless. But less funny and al lot more boring. <br /> <br />But maybe I'm being to harsh on Jane Austen. Not all books survive the teeth of time like Pride and Prejudice.

The same goes for Emma's father with his hypochondriac tendensies. <br /> <br />We see Emma growing up during the book, from a spoiled girl who likes to matchmake her best friends, into a (still spoiled) woman who has given up the matchmaking after she realizes that time after time her meddeling in the love-life of other people did a lot more harm than good. <br /> <br />Also not of this time (I hope) are the class-differences.

Perhaps \\"A Textbook in Eisogesis\\" or \\"Constructing Complex Theology From Non-Supporting Scriptures.\\" And really this book is an adventure in poor use of Scripture and unsupported statements.<br /><br />Let me say from the beginning that I believe silence is important. I believe solitude is important. Both are important parts of a healthy spiritual walk. I also believe in the importance of meditation, albiet meditation in a Puritan sense rather than an Eastern sense of the word. While these are good and necessary parts of a healthy spirituality, they are also dangerous if misused, and particularly dangerous if used in ways not only unsupported, but forbidden by Scripture.<br /><br />In Invitation to Solitude and Silence, Ruth Haley Barton seeks to lead the reader to prayer beyond words. \\"Much of our faith and practice is about words - preaching, teaching, talking with others. Yet all of these words are not enough to take us into the real presence of God where we can hear his voice. This book is an invitation to you to meet God deeply and fully outside the demands and noise of daily life\\" (from the back cover). This objection to vocalizing prayer is an undercurrent running throughout the book.<br /><br />The reader will doubtless not be surprised to learn that the primary Bible passage used to support Barton's theology of silent prayer is 1 Kings 19, where Elijah hears God's still small voice or a small sound or thin silence or a low whisper, depending on the translation. From this single passage, Barton draws out a complex theology of silent prayer wherein we will only fully experience God if we engage in this practice.<br /><br />According to Barton there are two primary reasons to enter into the silence. The first is to commune with God. She indicates that while words are useful, we sometimes use them too often and we can use them to express everything but matters of the heart. She encourages the reader to distinguish between heart and mind and to reduce the number of words in prayer while focusing instead on just being in prayer. The second reason to engage in silent prayer is to listen to God and receive guidance from Him.<br /><br />When discussing guidance Barton writes, \\"The fact that we can't see God makes it easy to slip into a pattern of doing all the talking ourselves. Is it too much to expect that God might speak back to us, not only with expressions of love but with guidance that is trustworthy and wise? Is it grandiose to believe God might actually interact with me in such a person and timely way? And if I do hear something, how do I know it is God's voice and not just my own thoughts masquerading as something more spiritual?\\" (page 118). The answer, of course, is that we do expect God to speak to us and to do so in a deeply personal way. Yet Scripture does not tell us that we should expect the type of personal revelation this book advocates. God speaks to use as the Holy Spirit applies Scripture to our hearts. This may be unsatisfying for people who desire to experience God in their way, in their time and on their terms, but this is what the Bible clearly teaches.<br /><br />There is great danger in allowing supposed personal communication from God to become normative. For example, Barton tells about God calling her to vocational, ordained ministry through her times of silence. Yet the Bible teaches with utmost clarity that women are never called to this type of ministry. She allows her personal experience to supercede the clear teaching of Scripture.<br /><br />While the book focuses primarily on a theology of silent prayer, each chapter concludes with a \\"Practice\\" section in which Barton practically applies what has been taught. Early in the book she suggests finding a sacred space and perhaps an icon or object to help focus on God. Here is an excerpt from a later chapter. \\"Take a few moments to allow your body to settle into a comfortable yet alert position. Take several deep breaths as a way of entering into the silence and making yourself present to the One who is always present with you...In your time of listening today, ask God to bring to your heart a moment in the last couple of days where you were most grateful...Is there any way God may be guiding you to choose more of what gives you life?\\"<br /><br />I was disappointed to see that Barton did not discuss the potential dangers of silent prayer. After all, this type of prayer is practiced in most of the world's religions. Many Christians believe, and with some justification I think, that entering the silence is the same for Christians as it is for Hindus or Muslims or adherents to any other system of religion. Surely it would be due diligence for Barton to warn that people may encounter forces other than God while in the silence.<br /><br />It should come as no surprise that I do not recommend this book for any reason. The teaching Scripturally indefensible and potentially very dangerous. The author would have us believe that we can only truly commune with God and receive His clearest guidance if we engage in this practice. Yet she is unable to prove this with Scripture and so we must toss this teaching on the ever-growing heap of unbiblical nonsense masquerading as Christian theology.

Well, maybe not that last part.  The Adventures of Soberman! is a tall glass of laugh-out-loud misadventures about the author's battle with alcoholism and everything else.  The author cleverly recounts his life experiences growing up Irish-Catholic in Hell's Kitchen, going to war in Vietnam, being married, realizing he is gay and discovering Alcoholics Anonymous-all while peppering his memories with hilarious and often touching anecdotes.

I didn't really think that I would have a single thing in common with a group of New England witches! Turns out, I feel like we were living parallel lives. I bought my own copy.    The women in this story lead normal lives, hold down jobs, and raise children -- except for one minor detail. They are all witches. Not the ridiculous nose-wrinkling ones from early television and definitely not the hook-nosed ones in the Halloween displays. They are decent, caring women who are trying their damnedest to save the planet -- and that's not as far-fetched as you'd think -- not today!    Granted that it took a while to feel comfortable being drawn into the rituals in this book, but I have to say that once I got used to it -- it felt good! These women have gotten psychic messages that the world is being threatened. They are as dubious as I was, but that soon changed.    In a world where more and more television and film introduces us to after-death contacts, magic, and the supernatural, I think this book deserves a look-see by anyone who enjoys good writing, a well-handled plot, and hard-won victories. I want to see more stories from Xanna Vinson.    And while I'm at it, let me tell you to also pick up Dr. Jean Bolen's newest book, \\"Urgent Message from Mother.\\" Look it up here on Amazon and you'll see what I'm driving at. \\"Dove\\" makes you feel good about women feeling empowered. \\"Message\\" shows you how to do it yourself!

If you like Donna Kauffman, you'll like this book.  The writing style is similar. Light in fantasy and light in sensuality or heat in the romance.<br /><br />The plot of this book was a little interesting. Although, the Atlantis theme is getting a little tiresome in most books, the Dragons make the book standout.<br /><br />I was not sure if this book will have a sequel or not.  The conclusion of the book left it open as to where the book of Draca is, and what plans the Vampire King could have against the Dragons.  Also, who would be the next Guardian of the mist to the other Portal into Atlantis.<br /><br />In some ways the whole concept of Fantasy creatures like Dragons using Kelvar vests was kind of amusing.<br /><br />Here's the basic plot. After Darius's family gets wiped out, he becomes one of the Guardians of the Mist, those who guard Portals from the Surface to Atlantis. Basic they're there to kill any travelers through the portal, be it man, woman, or child. Many centuries later, Grace is looking for her brother and stumbles accidentally through the Portal. But she is wearing one of the Guardians of the Mist's amulets.  So instead of decapitating her right away he brings her to Alantis to interrogate her about where she got the necklace. From there the plot thickens with Vampires who hate the Dragons and Humans who want to rape and pillage Atlantis to sell on Ebay.<br /><br />It was nice and light fantasy romance read. I probably would read a sequel to this book if there was one. Although, I think this Harelequin line are only suppose to have non-series books. I would definitely reccomend this book.	2005-10-13

Luckily, though late in the game, it finds one and comes to a satisfying if somewhat rushed resolution.     <br />Filled with memorable characters and memorable images, the novel sets out to be the story of Jeremy, a teenage boy sent by a dying mother to live with a guilt-ridden uncle who blames himself for the death of the boy's father years earlier in an industrial accident. But Jeremy, though likable, is too good to be an engaging protagonist, even in Christian fiction, which is what Bad Ground is labeled. A goody two-shoes is ultimately kind of dull for fiction, which thrives on spice, not sugar, and on moral ambivalence, not moral certainty. A character like Jeremy can be a good catalyst, however, and toward the end of Bad Ground, the author seems to realize this; suddenly the novel becomes the uncle's story, not Jeremy's. Good! Almost too late, but not quite, Bad Ground becomes character-driven instead of plot-driven, which is what it wanted to be all along.    <br />The reader won't much mind this misdirection because the uncle, named Aiden, AKA Snake, is worthy of his own story. Badly disfigured in the aforementioned accident (thus the repulsive nickname), he has withdrawn from life into a solitary existence that is a prison of his own making. Jeremy's unannounced arrival on the uncle's doorstep begins a process that eventually brings redemption and a new life to the uncle, a nicely drawn character.  <br />Readers may find Bad Ground somewhat fatiguing. Its many scenes in an industrial setting, mining in a gigantic tunnel for a water treatment plant in south Atlanta, can make you feel after reading a few chapters that you've pulled an eight-hour shift on a construction crew. The leisure-time scenes suffer a bit, too, from the absence of fully realized female characters, and some of the scenes, though entertaining, appear to be the author's marking time while he figures out whose story Bad Ground is. Nomatter. In spite of its flaws, Bad Ground is a likable novel and is very good writing. Cramer's simple, muscular prose and spare poetical images reflect an artist in full control of his medium except for the occasional and jarring grammatical lapse, misplaced modifiers.	2005-10-13
US	21971218	R37K0VMEE2VVLE	B0002YECOO	807587988	Life Inside	Books	3	9	19	N	N	Woe Is Me	Mindy Lewis was hospitalized in a teaching hospital for mentally ill adolescents and young adults, from the time she was 15 3/4 until she was a little past 18.  This \\"memoir\\" describes her family situation, her friends and the staff in the hospital, and her nutty behavior at times (drinks silicone grout on the spur of the moment).  Ms. Lewis blames everyone but herself for being put in the hospital. Prior to being admitted, she refused to go to school, took drugs, was promiscuous, and her mother could not control her. Her parents were divorced. Her mom worked and wanted a clean house.  Her stepfather walked around in his undershorts. All of this is pretty \\"normal\\", she finds out, for teens in the 60's.  Once Ms. Lewis is finally released, she goes through years and years of anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behavior, refusing to take any prescribed drugs for these sometimes debilitating conditions. Years later, she seems to have finished going through her phases.  She tries to call a few psychiatrists on the carpet about wasting two years of her life in the hospital.  But they don't seem to have too much remorse.<br /><br />Ms. Lewis has a way with prose, but the book is extremely disorganized and confusing.  She goes back and forth without letting the reader know that's what she's doing (in the end she justifies this by saying it was necessary for the book to  \\"flow\\").  Her best friend Marjee, somehow goes from age 13 to 17 (but most of the time she's age 13), while Ms Lewis goes from almost 16 to 18 in the same exact time period. She also somehow manages to graduate from high school by only taking an English class - and that only when she feels like it. I also don't buy the case notes of the staff as being genuine.  Another difficult story to believe was when she was in her twenties and had taken two jobs which started the same day, thinking she would considerately decide which one she wanted, on the morning she was to begin.  She has an anxiety attack in the subway, and when she gets off the police immediately cuff her, saying they have received \\"several calls\\" about her (this would be in the 1970's). The cops take her to Bellevue, but she talks her way out of that. And where did she get the photo of her topless self on the cover? Did staff or another patient take it?<br /><br />I'm sorry this happened to Ms. Lewis, but I guess I've just read about adolescents who've had it a lot worse.  I've even known people who been through much worse. So Ms. Lewis's constant whining and feeling sorry for herself doesn't grab me and make me go \\"Wow - this is amazing, what this woman has gone through.\\"  It probably would have helped the book if she had included some of her much talked-about artwork, as well as photographs of her family.ack in the subway, and when she gets off the police immediately cuff her, saying they have received \\"several calls\\" about her (this would be in the 1970's).

We have spanked our 6 year old daughter but I always thought it was the wrong thing to do.  I was surprised to read that Dobson's view on spanking is more conservative that I imagined. <br /> <br />He states clearly that it should not be done out of anger, it's a last resort after applying other forms of punshiment (e.g. timeouts, etc), it should be limited to three hits without leaving any marks or redness, and finally it shouldn't be administered at all if something else is going on such as adhd. <br /> <br />He indicates that spanking will actually worsen the problem with an adhd child which as it turns out is what my six year old has. <br /> <br />Now that I have sort of defended his spanking position, I thought the book on a whole was the least memorable parenting book I have ever read.  It's so general and skips many necessary parenting fundamentals that the book is virtually useless. <br /> <br />So many things can be going on with a kid, sibling rivalry, bullying at school, learning difficulties which play a substantial role in their behavior.  But these issues and more are never addressed. <br /> <br />I recall tellng my friend who never read the book but recommended it, that I would hope parents have read other books prior to this one.	2005-10-13

They were called communists, criminals and freeloaders by the president and members of congress during the worst years of the depression. President Hoover used US troops commanded by General Douglas MacArthur to drive them out of the city and the American voters were so outraged the incident helped carry FDR to the White House that fall. It would still be several years before the bonus was paid but the saga of the bonus army paved the way for the GI Bill of Rights and provided a model for every mass protest held in the capital since. <br />    Dickson and Allen provide a stirring narrative with an all star cast that includes Herbert Hoover, George Patton, Douglas MacArthur, Andrew Mellon, Dwight Eisenhower and J Edgar Hoover. <br />    The Bonus Army has faded from view over time and this worthy book brings an important era in or history back into focus.	2005-10-13

There are alot of controversial plots in current teen fiction these days, but they tend to eventually show the consequences and are thought provoking (and often riveting and realistic), this is also a common situation that is very interesting and that I would read more about.  We have all had serious crushes on teachers and authority figures, and this is ripe for so much more exploring.  This is about the tip of the iceberg.  There could probably be three more books on this topic alone.    In this story, we really get into Nine's head, and we love with her, yearn with her, feel our hearts break with her, and agonize with her.    What I would like to see are more books like this.  I'll admit that I was curious about the teacher crush angle and so are several people I know who would read more on it, but there is so much depth here as well as humor and compassion.

This book is \\"For Women Only\\" as the seal on the front cover shows.  She is somewhere between Erma Bombeck and Fanny Flagg with her type of humor and sayings.  This volume was written for those with a sense of humor but, if you've heard all that homespun advice, it's not so funny anymore.    None of the stuff women must live through during midlife crisis would be relevant to men, unless they are married to such creatures; they too have their own type of menopause.  Chapter 7 is all about the causes of men, as she makes fun of the male personality.  One I liked:  \\"Youth looks ahead, Old age looks back, Middle age looks tired.\\"    While the younger years may be the most fun, many grandmothers enjoy a more meaningful relationship with their adolescent grandchildren during the teenage years.   These are times the rebels in the family show their true selves.  They tend to turn for solace to loving grandparents during these turbulent times.  Teens trust those who have given them unconditional love during their growing-up years and who are nonjudgemental.    Memory is a mental bank account for elders.  In it, we deposit the treasures of our lives so that, in time of need, we can withdraw hope and courage.  Remembering good memories can make us feel like mental millionaires.  One of my heroes, General Douglas MacArthur once said, \\"Whatever your years, there is in every being's heart the love of wonder, the undaunted challenges of events, the unfailing childlike appetite for what comes next, and the joy of the game.  You are as young as your hope, as old as your despair.\\"  My doctor told me just today to \\"give in to the body's need to heal\\" and to take the needed naps with joy; don't begrudge the \\"time out\\" but look forward to six weeks down the road when you can do all the things you did before the invasive surgery.  Be accepting of the circumstances and don't fight against your best interests, getting well again.    Ms. Johnson uses an excerpt from one of \\"Dear Abby\\" columns called \\"How to Plant a Special Garden:\\"  First, plant five rows of peas: 'Preparedness,' 'Promptness,' 'Perseverence,' 'Politeness, and \\"Prayer.'  Next to them, plant three rows of squash: 'Squash Gossip,' Squash Criticism,' and 'Squash Indifference.'  Then five rows of lettuce: 'Let us be faithful,' 'Let us be unselfish,' 'Let us be loyal,' 'Let us be truthful,' and 'Let us love one another.'  And no garden is complete without turnips: \\"Turn up for church,' 'Turn up with a smile,' 'Turn up with determination.'  Leonard Levinson's quote, \\"Sorrow is the future tense of love.\\"  You've heard that it is better to be safe than sorry.  But, telling someone you love that you are sorry you said or did something which made them sad is one of the best things a woman can do.    Yes, this book is for women only; but the jokes about being old apply to the men, too.  It's funny -- hilarious to some, I'm sure, but insightful in a way we all need to be reminded.	2005-10-13

Since this is his best known work I knew I had to check it out. It is a very engaging book about Cuban brothers trying to make it in the US during the 50's Mambo craze. The story is very entertaining as many memorable characters both fictional and real Cuban musicians from the period are introduced.<br />The story while full of colorful epsiodes is ultimately tragic as the brothers age and life takes it's toll on each of them in very different ways.<br />Hijuelos uses sexual imagery and descriptions of food to create a steamy  intensity to the story with great effect. That said the lurid sexual descriptions cited by many other reviewers may turn off some readers. While I was enjoying the book enough to overlook this, there are times when he does rely too much on this device and the novel starts to feel like a guilty pleasure. If you are OK with that type of writing then there are rewards to be had in the characterizations and plot. If you cannot stomach the hard-core sexual references that are integral to this book then stay away and try one of his other novels.	2005-10-13

It was called the cold war because not much fighting occurred. To be sure, there was some in places like Korea, Viet Nam and Afghanistan. And there were some time where the two superpowers faced each other over loaded weapons such as Berlin and Cuba. But all in all, this was the longest time since the Roman Empire that the two strongest countries on the globe didn't go to war.  <br /> <br />During much of this time the Military History Quarterly has provided a venue for the most prominent historians of our time to present articles on points of history as it was being lived. Robert Cowley is the founding editor of MHQ. In this volume he has selected articles from the Cold War period that serve to be a history of the Cold War written as it happened. The authors include some of the most prominent historians of that time, and some others that are not so well known but who provide an insight into the times.	2005-10-13

The first half of the book deals with killing without remorse, necrophilia, and selfish, unsavory characters. Even the protagonist is not someone you'd want to know personally. The first half made me very uncomfortable and I thought about not finishing the book, but I continued to read on the strength of his writing. He would turn a phrase, or describe a color, in such a way that left me thinking. I could see in my mind's eye exactly what he was describing and, for that moment, I would want to continue to read.  <br /> <br />The second half of the book throws the four main characters together on a quest. Issues of personal power are the main themes. What would you do if you had the ability to take life, the power to give life, with just words.  <br /> <br />The story was not one that I expected. Chuck Palahniuk took me places I didn't expect to go. While it was a rough ride that required a bit of work on my part, I eventually found myself up to the task and enjoying the journey.  <br /> <br />I look forward to another one by this author.	2005-10-13

It's not really fair to compare it to her later work. All authors improve (or at least they should). However, taking this book as a first work and as a traditional Regency rather than the longer single-title works she now does, I hate to rate it highly.  <br /> <br />Yes, I wish David were better delineated as a character. Yes, it sometimes dragged. Yes, the plot could have been stronger. And yes, there were times the exposition or dialogue was sub-par. But over all, as a debut novel, it was quite good. When also considering the time in which it was published, it's very good.  <br /> <br />There are some excellent moments of tension, romance, humor, and intrigue. There are also some fine character moments. If they are not without flaw, I consider that merely a first novel situation. This book is still head and shoulders above so much that is published. I got this book from the library because of the mostly negative reviews. However, I liked it well enough to put it on my \\"buy\\" list. I might have rated it 3 stars if not for the other reviews, but it's much better than the rating made it seem.	2005-10-13

He is the kind that goes to place we only read about in news briefs in a paper's international section. The kind of places we'd rather not know too much about. <br /> <br />In this book (more like a collection of four books) he stays stateside and tries to find out about what the future holds for the youth of America. <br /> <br />From poor rural farmers in the Big Piney region of east Texas to kids stuck in the violent racist/anti-racist punk rock scene of southern California, Finnegan sticks himself into the lives of his subjects, living with them for monthes at a time. <br /> <br />He tries and I think succeeds on gainging insight into what it is like to be raised in working class America. <br /> <br />The book is heavy, and can be a bit of an emotional drain but it leaves you armed with perspective.	2005-10-13

Also on the trip are a bunch of would be romance authors. As usual, calamity strikes early and often starting with Emily's suitcase getting lost and their hotel burning down. But things really heat up when the publishing company sponsoring the trip holds a contest where the prize is a book contract with a cash advance of $10,000. Some people will do anything to win and before long the bodies start piling up. All the people who were killed were judges in the contest and Emily's mother is the last judge still around. Emily wants to solve the murder - fast - before her mother becomes the next victim.<br /><br />This is a funny cozy mystery. Hunter uses the story line to poke gentle fun at romance authors and readers, critics, agents, awards, publishers, Oprah's book club and even Amazon reviewers. Hunter populates the book with humorous, eccentric characters, including Emily's hot to trot millionaire grandmother; her mother who likes to alphabetize everything, including people; Emily's ex-husband Jack, who is now a gorgeous female named Jackie (who reminds me a lot of Lula in Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series); and the assorted Iowans on the trip, including one who wears on readers with her habit of rhyming everything. Etienne, Emily's long-distance, boyfriend appears in a series of phone calls and Hunter intriguingly throws in a handsome tour guide named Duncan, who also is attracted to Emily.<br /><br />The solutions to the murders is a bit of a let down, but don't let that stop you from reading this very funny mystery.	2005-10-13

I didn't read the other reviews which explain that it was orginially published together as a part 1 and 2, so I had to wait for the second and then review the first to remember where it left off.<br /><br />It is an epic fantasy and is well written.  Although I wouldn't put it in the same category or standard as someone like Martin, but still very enjoyable to read.  The plot is tamer and nicer.  It reminds me of something of a romance in that romances always have happy endings and nothing bad ever happens to the good guys.  So you know you won't be diappointed as your reading, you know what to expect from a romance.  Unfortunately, that is the very reason why I don't like to read romances--it's just not realistic.  Bad things do happen in real life, even to the good guys.  It is also why I gave this four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Basically, the story is about a nine year old girl, whose father dies in battle and her half brothers sees this as his opprotunity to claim the throne for himself.  She ends up going into hiding and for the next eight years moves from place to place throughout the entire kingdom and beyond.  Waiting until she is old enough to reclaim the throne.  The story shows how she grows and matures through these years.	2005-10-13

I read some ten to twenty reviews on this book here before buying it, and I've looked through the twenty-odd reviews that have appeared since, and it's clear that there's quite a partisan division in opinion. It's what you'd expect, I guess, from a book that is pretty open about all sorts of facts of life, the classical-music context notwithstanding.  <br /> <br />The book is very brave, and may turn out to be foolish, but it is a good read. It's not an in-depth analysis of the problems of classical music today, as some point out in their criticisms. But the inclusion of material on these issues certainly illuminated the very touching and human story that Blair tells. I don't think classical music is alone in the way it has disappointed some of its practitioners; one could probably find similar tales amongst the \\"freeway flyer\\" part-time faculty who teach a lot of the college classes in this country. I think one question that Blair's story raises is how divorced from reality our whole career-oriented culture is. I see college students every day (not as a freeway-flyer, but as a reasonably content full-time faculty member) and wonder about the heavy and ill-informed career decisions they are being asked to make without ever having had much experience of the real world.  <br /> <br />This book needs to be viewed as the memoir that it is, with the understanding that memoirs are going to be subjective and personal, but filled with a lot of data about how life is lived and experienced by people in situations very different from our own. Of course, a lot of the reviewers here are in situations that aren't very different from Blair's, and maybe that explains a lot of the vitriol.	2005-10-13

Ms Clow allows as to how that is the case. It's the reaction of all of us that will make or break civilization as we know it. Clow has a lot of material for us to chew on. <br /> <br />I've just read most of this book -- it's the technical one of the three I'm keeping close at hand. I like the meaty parts. Reality is a good thing. But I have to recommend that it be purchased with two other selections. <br /> <br />First, read \\"The Song of an Emerald Dove\\" by Xanna Vinson to get a feel for what it feels like to live in a world sensitized by global instability if you are a woman who \\"feels\\" in a psychic way and wants to help put things to right. Then pick up Dr. Jean Shinoda Bolen's newest work, \\"Urgent Message from Mother\\" in order to see how globally the 'messages' are being received -- and then use her wise suggestions to find a way to balance truth and imagination in your own mind and world -- and learn to take action in ways that will better prepare you and your loved ones to make it through *whatever* is on the horizon with flying colors. <br /> <br />We aren't a world of alarmists, not most of us. But there is a time when one has to ask: Am I insane to believe what I'm feeling? Or am I insane *not* to believe it? \\"Catastrophobia\\" helps you figure that out; \\"Message\\" helps you mobilize if you feel you should; and \\"Dove\\" makes you feel empowered -- and just plain good about taking those first steps to live in a changing world. <br /> <br />Read all three.

Much of the information about Elizabeth's early years seems to come straight from The Little Princesses, while the later years have little to add not heavily covered in media.  If you had never before read a book about Elizabeth, this might be a good starting place, as it's an easy read.  It's quite a sympathetic portrait of her, but not of almost anyone else in her life, especially her husband Phillip, of whom there is barely a civil word said.  The book does focus very much on her, and not her family, which is nice in a way, as there is so much out there about Diana and other family members.  I would have liked to read more about her as a mother, but from what is said here and elsewhere, it wasn't one of her biggest roles.  The photos included are a small and odd bunch, nothing comprehensive at all.  I did perhaps feel I knew Elizabeth's personality a bit more after finishing this read, and it was not BADLY written, but I can't really say it's a necessary or outstanding book.	2005-10-13
US	31420560	R285GB2ZXEU93A	0439211670	957478075	Birdwing	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Adults like it too	My 13-year-old nephew left Rafe's book at my house.  I read the first couple of pages and was instantly hooked.  I refused to return the book until I was finished.  For the adult that enjoys reading fantasy novels like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this book is for you.  The story follows Birdwing's quest to \\"find himself\\" and to learn to appreciate his differences.  This is a motivational story for anyone with a disability or inability to easily \\"fit in\\".  I enjoyed it immensely and highly recommend the book.	2005-10-13
