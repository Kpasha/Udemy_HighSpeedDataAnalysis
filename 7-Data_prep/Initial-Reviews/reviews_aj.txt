She concludes that even though the concept of motherhood is considered sacred in this country, women who bear and raise children are consistently undervalued, uncompensated, disregarded in many circles and most vulnerable to the possibility of living in poverty if they divorce or are widowed. <br /> <br />Crittenden contends that women who have children in the United States must sacrifice at least some level of professional advancement, societal status, leisure time, and economic security and/or independence.  She believes that college-educated women, who have (or had) the best shot of \\"having it all\\", lose the most.  If a highly educated women leaves the workforce to have a child, Crittenden cites data that estimates she will lose about a million dollars in lifetime earnings.  She will not be economically compensated for parenting and running a household; she will receive no social security benefits for the work she does at home; she faces an inflexible job market that offers minimal opportunity for adequately paid part-time work; and if she divorces, most state laws will deny her family assets because divorce laws do not count unpaid work. <br /> <br />As a career women who found that she couldn't have it all once she had a baby, Crittenden was inspired to write The Price of Motherhood after feeling continually marginalized because she had chosen to devote her energy to raising her son.  She points out that she and the millions of mothers around the country are undertaking the single most important task in America: raising the citizens of tomorrow.  Human capital is our most important resource in terms of our current and future nationalprosperity, and she labors over the idea that the work of primary care givers, namely mothers, is not counted in the GDP, or any other national economic calculation.  Assigning no material value to caregiving hurts everyone - working and non-working mothers, fathers and especially children.  She cites research suggesting that when women have access to resources, their children are directly affected in a positive way. <br /> <br />Crittenden asserts that all things being equal, the wage gap between men and women barely exists today.  However, the gap is wide and long between women with children and women without.  Huge numbers of women are deciding not to have children, and Crittenden believes this can largely be attributed to the high price of motherhood.  She calls it the \\"mommy tax\\" - even if a woman does return to work after having children, her earning potential and economic security is seriously diminished because of how our society undervalues the needs of working mothers.  The laws in this country contribute to the risks that women take when they have children: the U.S. is one of only six countries in the world that does not provide paid parental leave; stay-at-home mothers earn nothing towards social security for their work (whereas professional nannies do); more than one-third of divorced mothers have to go on welfare because the state laws do not recognize the cost of being the primary care-giver; and only eight states have laws prohibiting discrimination against parents in the workplace. <br /> <br />Crittenden proposes several changes at the familial, societal and legal levels to \\"bring children up without putting women down.\\" These include giving every parent the right to a year's paid leave; shortening the workweek; providing equal pay and benefits for equal part-time work; eliminating discrimination against parents in the workplace; equalizing social security for spouses; offering work-related social insurance programs to all at- home parents;  providing universal preschool for all three- and four-year-olds; stopping the taxation of mothers more than anyone else; providing free health coverage for all children and their primary caregivers; adding unpaid household labor to the Gross Domestic Product; transferring all responsibility for post-divorce payments to a single federal agency; providing community support for parents and parental education; and expanding the concept of diversity to include people with caregiving experience.	2005-10-09

While the book communicates in lush and sensual prose this concept, beyond that it has no direction or content, creating a literary world that is slightly more involved than particularly vivid wallpaper. The narrative is well paced and the character symbolic, but beyond that, nothing attracts within this book. It communicates its theme, and then repeats it. While this joins other literary works, from _The Sun Also Rises_ onward, in celebrating the slow death of Western society, it's unclear that there is any triumph here or anything more than a foreboding discharge of violence.	2005-10-09

I've got a few theories, but let's start with Hinn preying on the minds of the innocent hopeful, making them pay insurmountable amounts of money to an outright hoax who claims to heal. If he genuinely had the power of Christ to heal then why the hell is he making such a ridiculously scandalous profit from it? Innocent people are buying into his garbage every day in the hopes that there is some healing for their diseases.

If you are interested in what is really happening on the Front Lines of our President's War on Terror, this book will hit the mark.  Unfortunately, given the tenuous relationship between Iraq and Terrorism, you won't find much information on the causes of and remedies for terrorist acts.  What this book delivers is a hard-hitting and gripping account of day to day life as a National Guard soldier in Iraq.  From crappy, hand-me-down equipment to drug abuse and moral decay, John Crawford's personal story should be read by anyone contemplating a career in the military and anyone who wants to look beyond our Government's sugar-coated views and the Media's sanitized views of the conflict in Iraq.

I don't accept Descartes' starting point, so I find the entailments confused and incoherent. But if one does accept Descartes' starting point, then the two extremes must be heeded. If for no other reason than observing the absurdity of either man's conclusions, it is valuable to read both entailments. But in their confused process, both men bring certain salient features to light.<br /><br />Hume accepts Descartes starting point, making it his own. But to Descartes method, he adds Pyrrhonist scepticism: That all reason leads to infinite regress, and that all sensations (or impressions) can not be trusted.<br /><br />Hume begins with the conclusion that all sense perception is either an impression or idea. Even memory and imagination, two other faculties of the mind, are conflated into these two species of perceptions, as impressions. Their difference is one of degree (vivacity), not of kind. Hence, Hume is the author of what is known as the \\"Copy Principle.\\" Instead of unmediated, direct perception through the ordinary senses, all perception is mediated by the imagination into impressions and ideas. From this follows certain resemblances, contiguity, and causal associations between impressions or ideas, and from this association we develop a sense of self. But even the notion of causality here is one of implied inference, not of actual inductive reason. Hume denies there is any real causality that can be known, although we operate \\"as if\\" we infer cause from effect. Even probability is reduced to a mere association of ideas and/or impressions; because neither reason (which always leads to infinite regress) or senses (which can always be deceived) can actually be true. The Enquiry also treats of miracles and the testimony of others derisively; but don't we rely on the testimony of others who claim the earth is round rather than flat, just as we rely on others who testify to miracles in a byegone era? After all, few of us have direct experience with a spherical earth (Popper makes this observation).<br /><br />Hume's method incorporates five kinds of scepticism: (i) methodological, (ii) conceptual, (ii) nomological, (iv) explanatory, and (v) reductive empiricism. His commitment to scepticism is not without some capitulation. While he denies absolute causality and inductive inference and probability in an actual senses, he relies on them for practical purposes. One can't remain a pyrrhonist for long; some elements of reason and some degree of confidence in impressions is necessary for ordinary life. But if one starts with Descartes' starting point, extreme scepticism is a necessary entailment. Which, after seeing Hume deny so much intuition, is it really worth starting with Descartes' scepticism? Answering that question is what makes Hume interesting.testimony of others derisively; but don't we rely on the testimony of others who claim the earth is round rather than flat, just as we rely on others who testify to miracles in a byegone era?

The first story, spends the entire time with the thoughts of a female character whos name I can't even remember, and I have read the book in the past week. She has early tea or late dinner every Thursday with a man she met ( how they met I can't remember either) who happens to be a famous travel book author.  And that is where the story begins and ends. A constant discussion to herself of how she got into this habit with a man she does not particularly like, and who seems to find her dull company as well. She also seems to complain a lot about having to eat a \\"late tea\\" rather then a regular dinner.  Grimes' characters have always been interesting even though the storys may not be. In this case, she falls far from the mark. The characters are as flat and boring as the story. The story ends when the late teas are stopped, for reasons that I won't explain, incase someone makes the mistake of actually buying this book as I did. And by the way, in between these teas we see the main character spending her time at a train station cafe eating grilled cheese sandwiches or eggs, and just enjoying looking out the window. In Until The Mousetrap Closes, a middle aged woman meets a famous stage actor in a small tea room and so a another strange \\"friendship\\" begins. He is quite a bit younnger the she, but she is of course lonely and flattered by his attentions. They also end up having regular meetings for tea or dinner. During these meetings he begins to tell her about his new work, a completely new type of play. Everthing about it is experimental so he gives her little detail, which disappoints her. As the story unfolds, it becomes quite obvious that he is using her to try out play dialogue on, because the play is being written as the rehearsals go along. The plot becomes abvious after about the third page and goes down hill from there. Again I won't spoil the ending, but don't expect much. I cannot for the life of me find any point to these stories, or personalities in the characters, and this is very unlike Grimes. I own all her books  with the exception of her poetry. The only good point to the book was the recipe from the train cafe for the grill cheese and bacon sandwiches. Please people save your money on this one.	2005-10-09

LeMoir writes in engaging style, there are loads of diagrams, and he proceeds much deeper than merely cataloguing the standard piece sacs. The setting where each sacrifice would be sound or unsound is identified, and he discussed at length possible defensive ideas, and attacking follow-ups. <br />Most of the games are complete (rather than starting from a diagram position). In this book that is a real bonus, as it allows the reader to put the sacrifice in the context of the opening. In their review of this book the chess specialist Chessco called this \\"the definitive and the BEST word on the subject\\" and it is hard to disagree. True, sacrifices are only part of the game of chess, but if you are looking to add axcitment to your games, then this is book to get.	2005-10-09

While full of interesting facts and stories, it is set apart from most books by the depth of the analysis it provides.  It walks the line between history and social science, hinting at a theory of civilization and capitalism based on case studies from around the world.  Though professional it is not dry (though I am infamous for enjoying a good dry book).  My only criticism of it is the parts where it ventures into the cyclic theory of history.  This is a European (or French) historiographic technique of trying to edition long recurring cycles.  Frankly I find the concept forced (even more frankly, it's bunk!) and it always annoys me when I come across it...but it is part of the historical tradition Braudel was involved in, so it must simply be tolerated as a blemish on an otherwise stunning achievement.	2005-10-09

It has been produced 3 times on Broadway.  The 1906 production starred Mrs. Fiske and Arliss Howard and ran for 60 performances.  Other revivals followed in 1915 and 1933.  As we approach the century mark on this comedy of manners, it's an interesting look back to see what's changed and what still plays.<br /><br />The premise is still most interesting.  It follows the adventures of two divorced couples.  Phillip Phillimore, a prominent New York judge, has divorced Vida whose unconventional flare for see-through gowns & forays in Egypt make her Bohemian.  Wealthy heiress Cynthia Karslake married lawyer and horse enthusiast John Karslake for love and divorced him quickly, dropping him like a hot potato.  Cynthia is preparing to marry Phillip Phillimore, a sensible match for her after the flaming passion of the previous marriage burned out.  Both Vida Phillimore & Jack Karslake are unattached.  Business each has before the judge brings them to his residence on the eve of his wedding.  Therefore you have the engaged and both ex's trading banter and quips in the drawing room.<br /><br />Complications arise when single Englishman Sir Wilfrid Cates-Darby enters.  His suave and easy way plays with the American women he's come to admire.  He develops an attraction to both Cynthia Karslake and Vida Phillimore.  Cynthia becomes quite jealous as Vida flirts with her ex, fanning a spark that has not entirely gone out.  On the day of the wedding, Cynthia allows herself to be taken to the track by Sir Wilfrid, delaying her 3 p.m. wedding to 9 p.m.  This goes over like a lead balloon to a cadre of outraged Phillimore relatives including sister Grace, aunt Miss Heneage, & cousin William Sudley.  Phillip's brother Matthew is a clergyman who has preached liberally on divorce and intends to perform the wedding ceremony.<br /><br />Finally in Act III all draw together for the wedding, only for Cynthia to realize that her jealousy about her ex is stronger than her desire to marry the judge.  The play climaxes in the final act as Jack Karslake's investigation into Cynthia's quickie divorce reveals legal flaws that result in the fact that they're still married.  Vida hooks up with Sir Wilfrid and marries quickly at the Karslake residence.  Cynthia shows up with Jack thinking she's married Phillimore and Cynthia thinking that Jack's married Vida.  Misunderstandings are resolved as Cynthia realizes that Karslake kept the room exactly as she left it on the day she walked out on him.  Their passion flares as Jack replaces his wedding ring on the willing Cynthia's finger.<br /><br />What's changed?  In 1906, divorce was doubtless regarded as more of a scandal than our present-day culture.  So the hubbub that surrounds two divorced couples seems quaint.  However, the raw emotions that ex's can hold for each other still plays well.  The numerous servants in the various households seem quaint as does the fact that Phillimore's house doesn't have electricity, but Karslake's does.  The language of the play is quite elevated with numerous words in the judge's dialogue being not in most people's normal vocabulary.  The action of the play still flows well and could work with strong leads.  Overall, it's an interesting comedy almost 100 years later.  Enjoy!for Cynthia to realize that her jealousy about her ex is stronger than her desire to marry the judge.

This book does this seamlessly.  I will no doubt sooner or later encounter a verb that's not in there but that will hardly be a fault.  Do note, however, that the book by and large gives verb conjugations and some examples of use; it doesn't deal with register or collocation.	2005-10-09
US	30684496	R2RSMVQ6RAUUBO	0743273567	193175702	The Great Gatsby	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Wonderfully Written	I have just finished this book and it is a very pleasant read. The 1920's have always intruiged me and this book has made me even more hungry for stuff from this decade. I love Mr. Fitzgerald's method of writing, almost poetic in nature but borderline overly-sentimental (although the Age of Excess as the 20's were deemed may have aided in this extra drama).<br /><br />The way Fitzgerald characterized the rich is also very interesting. From Tom Buchanan to Jordan Baker, these rich social elites are wonderfully crafted with complex personalities. I love it! I also enjoy the the descriptive detail given to each scene...its amazing.<br /><br />Overall..a stunning piece of work that I would readily reccommend.	2005-10-09

It is rich in description and humor. The characters are given distinctive backgrounds and attributes to make us like them.

In agreement with the rest of the reviews to date, Asimov is very good at showing people how creative thinking and logical reasoning can be applied to various topics.  This man has had a large influence in my life through his books on science fiction, and science facts.  He was wiser than most, and very skilled at teaching.   <br /> He was an atheist however, and so some of his viewpoints especially in the first part of this book, could rub a religious person the wrong way.  It does no harm to hear another's viewpoint however, if not to learn something new, then to at least bolster up why you feel differently about certain issue's.  His book covers many different subjects, and so if you enjoy reading and flexing your mental muscle by having your mind rove about on different topics, then you are sure to find many of his essays, very interesting.	2005-10-09

Clarke is as usual a precursor and treats the subject with his typical style and insight, but the book is not without weaknesses. The character of captain Singh, for example, while developed at length during the first part of the book, seems to lose its definition at the end of the story.<br /><br />More importantly, the treatment of the social impact of the menace and its consequences is somewhat naive. For example, one would imagine that on Earth, the news of the sabotage would have caused the Reborn to be chased down. The handling of social aspects has never been Clarke's strength, but this is maybe what gives his novels this color so familiar to science fiction enthusiasts around the planet.<br /><br />Overall, this remains an good read, all the more because it touches on a subject which actually concerns all of mankind and deserves awareness. It certainly fares much better than the movies on a similar subject that appeared in theaters in 1998, Armageddon and Deep Impact.	2005-10-09

BIG GIRLS DON'T CRY is the story of two women who discover they are married to the same man. Reenie and Elizabeth both feel happily married. The one thing that makes them discontented is that their husband, Keith O'Connell, spends two weeks of each month working away from home. <br /> <br />It's Elizabeth's brother, Isaac Russell, who notices that something does not add up. While discussing a major car accident on the freeways of Sacramento, where Keith supposedly worked two weeks out of the month, Isaac notes that Keith says it had no impact on his commute. Isaac can tell that Keith is lying, but why? Isaac would not have thought twice about it, except he accidentally sees Keith at the airport in Los Angeles, when Keith is supposed to be in Arizona. Isaac decides to miss his own flight to follow Keith and find out what's really going on with his brother-in-law. What he discovers is beyond belief. Keith was on his way to see his other wife, Reenie, in Idaho. When Elizabeth learns the truth, and is told that Keith wants to stay with wife number one, she makes an impulse decision. She and her two children move to Idaho to be closer to daddy.\\"  Complete review at BookLoons dot com.  - M Lofton for BookLoons. <br /> <br />A pager turner!

How is this man connected to Holly?  Where is her husband?  Can she do this without anyone else getting hurt and finish before they have to leave the big island? <br /> <br />I always enjoy books in this series.

The narrator and Luo are teenagers sent to the country in order to be re-educated.  In the late 60s in China, it was decided that education was dangerous and that the youth should spend some time doing hard labor in the country in order to adopt good proletarian values.  Luo and the narrator were especially in trouble because they came from educated families (doctors and dentists).  The work is hard, but much more is the isolation, the boredom and the lack of hope.  Books are forbidden objects, and like anything illegal, they become the object of obsession for the narrator and Luo, and they do not stop till they are able to find some.<br /><br />Simultaneously, they befriend the daughter of the local tailor, a girl beautiful and pure.  Both boys fall for her.  She chooses Luo.  Luo sets on a quest to educate the little seamstress of the title, and begins to read to her the great works of Honor&eacute; de Balzac.<br /><br />I am surprised at the many readers that were confused by the ending.  To me it is very obvious what happened.  In very prosaic terms, Luo \\"created a monster\\".  The little seamstress was a country bumpkin, who didn't know a thing about the world.  She lived in the mountains, believed in sorcerers, and was completely unaware of herself as a woman.  After opening her eyes to other worlds, which is what happens when you read books, she awakened, took charge of her own worth, and grew up.<br /><br />I enjoyed the ending, the simplicity of it, and the heartbreak the reader suffers.  I like to be surprised by what i read, so i appreciated it.  But in general i was left with the sense that this book has been overrated.  It was an OK read, but it was nothing special.	2005-10-09

A lot of the advice in this section is good but has been stated before.  I also would have liked some practical applications like what to do to help overcome fear.<br /><br />Part 3 talks about living a life that has put fear in check.

If we were to cull the empty half-pages (the author often had less than a page to write about some wineries; whatever happened to descriptive comments about all, or at least some, varietals, offered?), the useless recommendations on accommodations and shopping areas (I ordered a book billed to be about San Diego area wineries, not Bed & Breakfasts and mini-malls), and the author's many references to a tasting room reminding her of something in Europe, we would end up with a book a little more than half the size of this book... and at $15 retail, the book is already overpriced. <br /> <br />There is some useful info regarding wine tasting, forming a tasting club, and comparisons of varietals, but this book could certainly have gone much further in identifying the relative quality of various wineries or different varietals within each winery's list of offerings. <br /> <br />I bought this book as an out-of-towner with hopes of going to San Diego to sample some of the local wines.

If I could give half stars, this would get 3.5/5.   <br /> <br />I expected this book to be a chronicling of the B92 station in Serbia.  However, it is more accurately an account of Serbia's political landscape in the 1990s, loosely threaded with a narrative of B92 and Serbian independent media.  There is much less radio content than expected, and much more historical-political context.  <br /> <br />That said, the book is a pretty good read.  It's a nice account of a turbulent decade in Serbian history, presented in a highly readable text.  I believe Collin is a writer for Rolling Stone, which makes for a very digestable book. <br /> <br />I was disappointed at how little radio content was included, but the history is quite interesting.	2005-10-09

I was caught up in Rowand's precise descriptions of every race, and the implications of every race, which his horses ran. Something else I liked: this is a \\"we\\" book.

Yes, I get the parable, but as long as corporate America pretends to trust the employees, the employees will pretend to be accountable.  Save your money for an oil change for your car instead.	2005-10-09

Just for starters I can't beleive I wasted $25 on the hard-cover to support this disapointing book just because my favorite author wrote it.  <br />I just did not expect such an abismal book from an author who such masterpieces like Fight Club, Invisible Monster, Choke and others. Books that had brought me back to reading and writing. <br />This book is to Chuck Palahniuk what \\"Episode One\\" was to Star Wars. <br />This book is told through a course of short stories and than the story, which sounds like an cool concept but quickly turns tedious. The main story is where the book really falls short, with an uninspired feeling and also feeling a little bit forced. Another thing is the material. It feels recycled from his passed books perpetuating a feeling of unoriginality, something that Palahniuk books tend to never have. If you have ever read any of his past works you'll notice that his originality and sheer honesty is what makes his past books so provocitive and great, something that this book lacks in spades. <br />The high point in book are the poems and short stories where even than some are a tad dull.  <br />Stories like \\"Guts\\", which talks about how a young kid finds odd ways to get off, and \\"Dog Years\\", which talks about a teenager who sufferes of a disease which makes him grow old quickly and guilts hot housewives to have sex whith him, keep this book going. In these stories is where the book finds salvation. <br />So my conclusion is save your money and browse around for a better book.	2005-10-09

I needn't have been, this book was worth every minute. Mr. Black delivers a comprehensive yet concise narrative of FDR's life and times without meandering too far off the subject in, (what I found), a lively manner. Sparing you a mini-FDR bio here, Black provides a much needed description of FDR's almost other-worldly intuition. If at times he credits FDR with a foresight that belies belief, Black can be forgiven, for in hindsight FDR's vision for the US was extraordinary .... and correct. I highly recommend this book.	2005-10-09

Here was a man who learned to compromise and build a consensus when acting for his people.  This should be required readng for all children, and for any adult who has aspirations as a leader of children, of a community, or a nation.  If physical prowess and aggressive territoriality are really to be the hallmarks of our society's heroes, then let us have a role model that adds to those qualities expert diplomacy and a deep caring for the nation's children. That this book is in his own words makes it more powerful and persuasive.

This thesis has been developed by among others, Dore Gold, in 'Hatred's Kingdom' ,Gerald Posner in \\"Secrets of the Kingdom\\" and John R. Bradley in 'Saudi Arabia Exposed\\".<br /><br />Murawiec a career diplomat has however special insight into the processes of diplomatic corruption especially within the State Department. He cites the present ruler of Saudi Arabia Prince Abdallah's remark that ' taking care of career diplomats when they finish the service' is the best introduction and incentive to new diplomats as to how to act in regard to Saudi Arabia. Murawiec thus points to the tremendous amount of corruption done by Saudi money within the realm of the U.S. government.<br /><br />He is a strong advocate of a new policy toward Saudi in which the US would get tough with the Monarchy. It would insist on end to anti- Western and US propaganda in the schools, an end to the training of ' fighters' many of whom make their way into Iraq to attack American soldiers. It would insist on true reforms within the Saudi regime, and an end to its vast support network for Terror throughout the world.<br /><br />Murawiec believes the Saudis control over the oil market has led to a great increase in the poverty of the poorest nations. While he does not advocate, what might seem , the most logical step for stablizing world oil markets, the takeover of Saudi oil by a US led democratic coalition he does insist that the present situation is one which threatens to lead disaster to the world - economy as a whole.<br /><br />This is a timely wake- up text about a corrupt Middle Eastern regime which unfortunately has been corrupting US diplomacy and foreign policy for decades.	2005-10-09

So just what was Tammany Hall anyway?  Tammany Hall evolved from a fraternal organization founded in 1789 known as the Society of St. Tammany.  Tammany Hall embraced recent immigrants and the workingmen of the city. Eventually, under the direction of one William Tweed, this organization would join forces with the Democratic party and emerge as the most powerful political organization in the nation. In \\"Boss Tweed: The Rise and Fall of the Corrupt Pol Who Conveived the Soul of Modern New York\\" author Kenneth Ackerman documents the rise and fall of Tammany Halls most famous and controversial leader. It is compelling reading.<br /><br />The story of \\"Boss Tweed\\" is not quite as cut and dried as you might think.  Certainly there was corruption of monumental proportions. The foursome that would forever be known as \\"Tweed Ring\\" included Tweed himself (Commissioner of Public Works), Peter B. Sweeny (Public Parks Board), Richard Connelly (Comptroller) and A. Oakey Hall (Mayor).  With the passage of \\"home rule\\" for NYC by the state legislature in 1870, the stage was now set for the \\"Tweed Ring\\" to wreak havoc with New York city's finances.  That legislation, which was backed by Tweed himelf in Albany was a recipe for disaster. With virtually no checks and balances in place, it has been estimated that between 45 and 200 million dollars was swindled from the City. By 1871, New York City was a house of cards ready to crumble.  It would take the courageous leadership of a number of prominent individuals, most notably cartoonist Thomas Nast of Harper's Weekly, George Jones and Louis Jennings of the New York Times and future presidential candidate Samuel Tilden to finally bring the \\"Tweed Ring\\" to its knees.<br /><br />But as Ackerman points out there was another side to William Tweed.  He possessed genuine empathy for the  recently arrived immigrant and the workingmen of his city. To many such people he provided a patronage job and hope for a bright future in a new land.  Tweed was also a visionary.  It was Tweed who essentially laid the foundation for what would become the modern New York City.  As you will see, this was an exceptionally talented yet fatally flawed individual.  It might be hard to believe but by the end of his life William Tweed had actually become a rather sympathetic figure.  How the mighty had fallen!<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, there have been references to Tammany Hall in any number of books I have read in the past few years.  By reading \\"Boss Tweed\\" I now possess a far greater understanding of the pivotal role that this organization played in the history of New York City. This knowledge will certainly enhance my future reading.  \\"Boss Tweed\\" is an extremely informative and well written book that can be enjoyed by a large cross section of readers.

I give his methods a five, but the overall book gets a three, at best. A two wouldn't be off the mark.<br /><br />The first sixty pages are complete with Barry gushing about the number of languages he says he knows. My only question - does Barry know just enough of each language to introduce himself, ask simple directions, and attempt to order a meal in an authentic restaurant, or is Barry fluent enough in over twenty languages to sit as First Chair Translator in the United Nations? At one point, Barry states his Chinese was so good, he flabbergasted a Chinese waitress so badly she screwed up the order for the entire table. I believe a more approximate assessment would be Barry's choice of vocabulary, diction and accent was so bad, she couldn't help but make major errors in their meal orders.<br /><br />The language examples he provides in a language he speaks about sounds like something that can be found in any basic starter language book or audio course. The Appendix material starting at page 140 to the end are useless.<br /><br />Between page 60 to the Appendix are Barry's methods. While I didn't really learn anything new that I am not already doing (learning Japanese) I applaud Barry's methods. A solid grammar course booklet, a good dictionary containing the target language and your own native language, the use of audio (tapes, CD's, MP3 players in today's lifestyle) flashcards, and other various printed materials and sources. Yes, the book needs to be updated, but anyone serious about their target language can fill in the updated blanks.<br /><br />Barry makes a few good points. Set a game plan and stick with it. Don't give up. Be consistent in your studies. Use different sources. His use of memory aids. While some of Barry's ideas of using wasted time to study are a little off the mark (while brushing your teeth, or the one that made me laugh - while you are grunting inaudible 'yes, no, uh-uh, really?' responses to your friend blathering on the phone, pretending you are hanging on their every word) there are better down times that can be used, and will retain what you are learning. Commmuting to and from work. Lunch time. Mindless TV viewing. (How many times can you watch the same hour of ESPN reruns before you decide you had enough?)<br /><br />If you have no clue as how to self teach yourself a language, then purchase the book. Otherwise, if it can be found in a bookstore, read pages 60 to 140, take notes and save your money. Or read the other posted reviews that pretty much explain his methods in a few sentences and save yourself the time and expense.	2005-10-09

Bond is in a reflective mood in this one; this brings a depth to the story that is lacking in other 007 adventures. Like Raymond Chandler, Ian Fleming developed his craft as he wrote a series of books surrounding one character (for Chandler, it was Philip Marlowe). Chandler's last Marlowe novel, \\"The Long Goodbye,\\" has the same feel of world-weariness in the main character as this Fleming novel has in Bond's attitude and in his complexity. \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" is simply a brilliant page-turner, and wonderful entertainment from the same guy who brought us \\"Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang.\\" Hooray for Ian Fleming.	2005-10-09

Montaigne's style of writing is sometimes stream-of-consciousness, sometimes structured in more formal styles.<br /><br />Montaigne's stated task in his preface to the reader is for self-examination, but it becomes very clear that Montaigne sees himself as an 'everyman' character.  He strives for full-disclosure; indeed, he writes that were he another culture 'which are said to live still in the sweet freedom of nature's first laws', then he might have appeared naked.<br /><br />The particular essays included here are as follows:<br /><br />* Of Idleness<br /><br />* Of the Education of Children<br /><br />* Folly to Measure True and False by Our Own Capacity<br /><br />* Of the Inconsistency of Our Actions<br /><br />* Apology for Raymond Sebond<br /><br />* Of Repentance<br /><br />* Of Husbanding Your Will<br /><br />* Of Physiognomy<br /><br />* Of Experience<br /><br />Montaigne's essays show a pessimism and skepticism, perhaps based on the kinds of conflicts between Catholics and Protestants going on, in France and elsewhere, as well as the periodic flare of plague.  He was a humanist who saw cultures as having value internal to themselves and preferred to not universalise morals, laws and other ideas.<br /><br />Montaigne was sometimes conventional in thought (seeing marriage as necessary for children, and distrusting the idea of romantic love), but other times he was very much a free thinker (particularly when it came to religious dogma or absolutist kinds of philosophical paradigms).  Montaigne had respect for those who followed religious codes and ways of life, but distrusted those who tried to impose such ideas upon others.<br /><br />Montaigne added to his essays twice in major ways, but did not strive for consistency or systematic ways of thinking - he declined to remove previous essays if they contradicted new writings.<br /><br />Montaigne is perhaps the most important French philosopher prior to the Enlightenment.  His essays remain popular because they have a sense of the modern and the current about them.t for those who followed religious codes and ways of life, but distrusted those who tried to impose such ideas upon others. <br /> <br />Montaigne added to his essays twice in major ways, but did not strive for consistency or systematic ways of thinking - he declined to remove previous essays if they contradicted new writings. <br /> <br />Montaigne is perhaps the most important French philosopher prior to the Enlightenment.

The author gives you sample schedules, explanations of typical procedures and medications, and many stories of what other people have been through.  It is all in plain English, like you're talking to your best friend, but explains complicated terminology, and provides a great balance of being hopeful and yet logical/practical/cautious.

Books	1	44	101	N	N	Didactic propoganda	I've been a youth services librarian for two decades and I am astonished that so called \\"conservatives\\" feel there is nothing of value for them in children's publishing, which produces thousands of books each year from dozens and dozens of publishers. It's unlikely they have read all 16,000 books on my children's floor because they dismiss hundreds of the finest writers in the world by comparing them to the horribly written \\"Heather Has Two Mommies\\" and \\"King and King\\" again and again. Books meant \\"to teach\\" rarely stand the test of time, whether they are about alcoholism, divorce or politics, and I avoid those fringe books like the plague. Rather, stick with the great classic and contemporary writers as Eric Carle, Nancy White Carlstrom (who has a hugh Christian following for some of her titles with a small press), Rosemary Wells, Kevin Henkes, Mercer Mayer, Steven Kellogg, Martin Wadell, Stan and Jan Berenstain,and so many more who explore childhood issues with sensitivity, humor, compassion and love. young children don't need to be preached to. They need to have conversations about the world with loving adults who will answer their questions and ask them about their dreams. You need books for kids that reflect your values? Go talk to your local librarian and get some real writing that will fill your soul and avoid this crap.	2005-10-09

He was also notable for the sheer number of appearances that he made on TV game shows such as the \\"Hollywood Squares\\" where he was a regular for many years. In other words, Paul Lynde was one of many actors who had a lucrative career, yet who was hardly a household name. He was both rich and obscure, able to enjoy the Hollywood life without having to put up with the likes of the paparazzi. <br /> <br />Now, however, that obscurity has been lifted with the publication of Center Square: The Paul Lynde Story by Steve Wilson and Joe Florenski. Paul Lynde's life story has been revealed for the tragedy that it really was. Here was a man who was at one point making $50,000 a week during most of the 1970's, yet considered himself a failure because he never had a starring role in a major motion picture. This despite his previously cited accomplishments in addtion to significant supporting roles on such movies as \\"Bye Bye Birdie,\\" \\"The Glass Bottom Boat,\\" \\"New Faces,\\" and \\"Send Me No Flowers.\\" He also supplied the voice of Templeton the Rat in the animated classic \\"Charlotte's Web.\\" Most folks would consider that to be a pretty successful career. <br /> <br />The main reason why Lynde failed to land a starring role in a movie was because he simply could not say no to any offer. As a result, he was constantly working and casting directors came to assume that Lynde was simply too busy doing game shows and the like to take on a major role. Additionally, he became typecast in Hollywood as a sitcom guest star and game show participant and not as a serious actor. <br /> <br />Center Square: The Paul Lynde Story is a solid book.  Center Square: The Paul Lynde Story is heartily recommended as a book about Hollywood that goes beyond the fluff and gloss found in most other books about filmdom and TV-land.	2005-10-09

Tempest Down was a disappointment.  This book, Rogue Angel, was worse.<br /><br />Mr. Rovin has, once again, seen fit to dispense with actual research and veracity, substituting lame plot points and actual idiocy for a story.<br /><br />The forms of address are once again incorrect.  Rear Admirals are not called \\"Rear Admiral\\" by anyone unless they are in deep trouble and getting reamed out.  Likewise Lieutenant Commander.  Just a jarring bit that made the story grind to a halt.<br /><br />As far as the LASER team, let's leave aside the fact that there are already teams formed for rescues under adverse conditions.  The LASER team seems to delight in doing training that will likely kill its members.  No one trains for missions by parachuting into a live volcano.  What utter nonsense.  If they wanted to practice extracting people from fires, they could do what every fire department does, and simulate the fire.  But that would not give us an opportunity to see just how inept the LASER team is at executing what is supposed to be their main job.  Poor writing.<br /><br />The aircraft are complete nonsense.  Aside from using non-military aircraft for military missions, and having subsonic aircraft being considered for sustained supersonic flight, the flight sequences are poorly done at best.  Radar is a super detection device, able to see from Sakhalin Island by Japan all the way to California, or it can't see another aircraft a short distance away.  Even backscatter over the horizon radar can't do what is in this story.<br /><br />The Angel itself is tested off an aircraft carrier, the USS Hidalgo.  USS Hidalgo?  When did we have a president or military hero named Hidalgo?  Must have missed that class.  The Angel itself is described as being the size of a Boeing 737.  Flying off a Nimitz class carrier?  And then being able to land back on the same carrier?  No wonder Rovin had to decide to make the Angel be able to flap its wings to hover.  Ridiculous as that sounds, it is no more ridiculous than landing a 737 sized aircraft on a carrier.<br /><br />Let's look at the Chinese.  At first I thought Rovin was writing about Taiwan.  Why?  Because the two main Chinese characters have first names of Bruce and Christine.  Last name of Chan.  Born in mainland China.  Bruce and Christine?  Well, at least the book had a laugh in it.<br /><br />Then we have Chinese fighter aircraft flying across the Pacific ocean, refueling from a tanker, making an incursion into American airspace, with the end intention of landing on the Brazilian aircraft carrier Sao Palo.  A simple look at Jane's All the World's Navies would have told Mr. Rovin how idiotic that idea is.<br /><br />Lastly, Mr. Rovin seems to think that if he needs an acronym, why just make one up.  After all, SOP might mean Standard Operating Procedure in the real world, and in every other military techno-thriller in the world, but Rovin just tosses out ridiculous phrases and keeps going, much like an 8 year old making up military sounding words while playing soldier.<br /><br />Please don't waste your hard-earned money on this.  If you want it that bad, e-mail me your address, I'll send you my copy.  Normally I'd give the used book to the Veteran's Hospital nearby, but I figure the Vets have suffered enough.<br /><br />Definite don't buy/don't bother reading.decide to make the Angel be able to flap its wings to hover.

I fell madly in love with it.  It is a beautiful book that not only appeals to people who are interested in the Vietnam War, but also people who are interested in writing and literature.  At first, the Vietnam aspect didnt appeal to much to me, but the way O'Brien writes just swept me off my feet.  Tim O'Brien sets an example of an amazing contemporary author.

The authors, who come from power lifting and endurance sport backgrounds, recommend an approach that is similar to the one advocated by people like Wayne Westcott, Matt Brzycki,Dan Riley and Ellington Darden, in other words, low volume, high intensity with slow, controled movements. They do discuss other approaches, such as multiple-set training and plyometrics and come down against them, but don't flat-out say \\"Our way is right; every other way is wrong,\\" instead giving the pros and cons of different techniques.  I also like that their nutrition advice is very sensible, advocating good, basic nutrition rather than fad diets or supplements.  While the target audience is newcomers to strength training, more experienced trainees can still benefit from it, picking up some new techniques, learning about competitive lifting or just getting a refresher course on the basics.  The best thing about the approach they recommend is that it's one that can easily be adapted into your life with your other interests.	2005-10-09

Janette Oke was perhaps one of the first popular authors who brought the pioneers to the forefront of Christian fiction. Her characters were called to give up all security and to travel miles on uncomfortable, canvas-covered buckboard wagons with no hope of air-cushioned shocks; endure the roughest of climactic conditions with no thought of the comfort of micro-fleece; and stave off death with a fierce stubbornness.    Judith Miller follows in this tradition with First Dawn, yet with a twist. The first book in the Freedom's Path series from Bethany House Publishers contrasts the life of two families who choose to pursue land settlement in Kansas: a doctor and his family who live a life of privilege in Georgetown, Kentucky, and the Harbans, a family of former slaves who dream of farming their own land.    In the late 1800s, after the end of the Civil War and the freeing of the slaves, parts of the frontier states began courting former slaves to buy land and settle it for five dollars per homestead. The entrepreneurial dream of working for themselves coaxed many to travel hundreds of miles away from everything they'd ever known to help settle the west. Ezekiel Harban is such a man. Father to three daughters, he uproots the family and moves them from Kentucky to a new town being settled by Negroes: Nicodemus, Kansas, named for an African prince brought to America in chains and reportedly the first slave ever to buy his freedom.     Contrast this with Yankee doctor Samuel Boyle who married a Southern belle and moved to Kentucky. Yet with his staunch convictions about black men being treated as equals, he's never found his niche in the South and decides to start a new practice in Hill City, Kansas, the white settlement in the Solomon Valley. And so this storyteller begins to weave her storytelling magic.    Armchair Interviews says: Miller is a wonderful storyteller who unravels a fascinating part of history artfully and tastefully. The suspense is mild, but the story isa good one.	2005-10-09

Time has not diminished the drama of the tale of the Uruguayan rugby team whose plane crashed in the Andes Mountains. Of the forty five people on the plane at the time of the crash, sixteen came down from the mountain about seventy days later with a saga of survival not easily forgotten.<br /><br />Theirs is a journey born of tragedy and human endurance. The author unfolds a tale that is gripping in the telling, as enthralling as it is almost unbelievable. It is investigative reporting at its best, because it does not fail to convey the human drama and pathos behind the story of this remarkable struggle for survival high up in the Andes Mountains. Masterfully written, it is a well balanced narrative that takes great pains to ground the experience of the survivors in the context out of which it arose.<br /><br />The plane had crashed in the Andes Mountains on Argentinian territory. It was an exercise in terror for those on the plane, as it barreled down the mountain, before finally coming to rest in a valley of snow high up in the Andes. Of the forty five persons on board, thirty two had initially survived the crash. Some, however, had sustained serious injuries. Time would not be their friend. Moreover, with little warm clothing (keep in mind that October is springtime in South America), the survivors were exposed to the extreme cold of the night air, high up in the Andes. Though spring, this still meant temperatures well below freezing. Damp, cold, and hungry, amid the anguished cries of the injured, thus began the first of many such nights.<br /><br />By their tenth day in the Andes, the limited food supplies, which they had rationed with all the care of a miser, had virtually run out. Starving and ravenously hungry, they voiced what they all knew to be true, but had not dared to voice before. They must eat, or they would die. The only thing left for them to eat, however, was abhorrent and deeply repugnant to them. Digging deep into their conservative, religious souls, they found a way to justify actions that would have them transcend a new reality. Their fallen comrades would now provide the means of their sustenance. All eventually succumbed to this only means of survival.<br /><br />This, while one of the most dramatic parts of their story, is just that, a part. Their survival entailed much more. They had to endure other deprivations. They had to survive the elements. They had to overcome a profound despair over being seemingly forgotten by the outside world. Ultimately, only sixteen were able to do so. How they did so will fascinate all readers of adventure literature. The means that they took to let the world know that they were still alive will astound even the most jaded of readers. It is an account of human endurance that is thought provoking and compelling, a quest to reconcile physical needs with the spiritual. It is, above all, a riveting testament to life.ouls, they found a way to justify actions that would have them transcend a new reality.

After losing a dear mother to \\"cancer\\" that health care professionals failed to \\"cure\\" or to say the least make her last months tolerable and seeing other loved ones suffer by the hand of \\"prescription drugs and treatments\\" that make matters worse, I wanted and needed a road map to manage my own health and wellness. Natural Cures... book has become that roadmap and I have become a manager of my destiny. Having bought and read the book only a week ago and surfing the net for some of the cleansing and organic food solutions he discusses, I am feeling better and am developing a level of comfort I have not experienced in a decade.  <br /> <br />To the nay-sayers  <br />Because everyone needs to earn an income to live/survive in this society, it is expected and encouraged that Trudeau has an e-commerce website that offers additional information for consumers to purchase and benefit from.

This book is so good and so rich on so many levels, and the centuries have not made it any less a terrific read than it must have been when first published.  There are so many reasons to read it -- I'll choose one.  If you want to understand human nature in something approaching all it's depth and complexity, you can do no better than to read Gibbon's tales of what happens when a long succession of very different characters attain total dominion over the entire civilized world.  The incredible variety of comedy, calamity and infamy is unmatched even in Greek Myths or the Bible, and to my mind, at least, the story telling is better.	2005-10-09

I liked learning pattern making with this book.  It doesn't illustrate how to draft a pattern from scratch like some other books, my favorite being Dorothy Moore's book for that.  I used the eighth scale patterns in the book, made a zillion of them, and used those little patterns for \\"pattern labs\\" for each example and each style.

Bravo to Ms. Guiliano for writing a diet book that doesn't involve 'dieting' at all. The author speaks only of a lifestyle that every American should adopt. Eat less, move more and savor life in the process. Dieting is only a temporary quick fix - not a sustainable lifestyle. We 'succeed' while on the latest diet craze only to 'fail' when we return to our normal eating habits. Who hasn't omitted carbs, eaten cereal for two weeks, or tried the grapefruit diet? And how long has your success lasted? It's about tradeoffs and compensation. If your main meal is at lunch, have a light dinner or vice versa. Have dessert, but only a few bites - it's all your tastebuds need anyway. Dieting encourages deprivation - and what American wants to feel that? I would much rather enjoy half a delicious meal than a whole bland one! Quality over quantity! We live in a demanding culture where Americans want it all, move at mach speed, technology is at an all time high making life more convenient. This is a challenge that we must work around. Take the stairs when you can. Slow down long enough to allow yourself to savor your cuisine without mindless stuffing yourself. Your body will dictate when it's had enough food if only you give it a chance. We should take care of ourselves, eat delicious food in moderation, and make this a lifestyle! I say, let us eat cake - a few bites never hurt anyone. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />  <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-10-09

The second is a mostly serious look into a family of gay people (the same characters) in New York City during Christmastime who are still trying to come to terms with their faith(s).<br /><br />It is a very difficult play to pull off, as the two parts are very disjunctive and involve a lot of skill from the actors to pull off, plus a real understanding of it from the director... and neither productions I've seen of this play have had such full coherency.  It's difficult because it underminds its own theme.  It seems to be an essay on the fact that \\"We can never really know\\", and yet it goes in directions that doesn't seem reasonably needed (some of the Ark scenes, for instance).<br /><br />It also focuses a lot on homosexuality and homosexual characters and their approach to life and the like (this play has some very un-PC moments, along with some pretty graphic nudity, even for a movie much less a live show), yet they seem to balance precariously between the stereotypical gay and the less one-dimensional gay.  It muddles the dialog and causes some pretty crazy interpretations each time it's produced.<br /><br />Thus, it is a project that must be approached delicately.  It still has some really great dialog and is very funny, especially during the first half, but it's a little thick (not deep) and takes a lot of sorting out.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB	2005-10-09

I loved \\"Way of the Peaceful Warrior\\" when I first read it at least twenty years ago.  And I've continuted to love it as I've re-read it periodically over the years.  In \\"Warrior,\\" Dan Millman created a myth that spoke to the young man I was on many levels -- the usefulness of getting lost and depressed, the possibility of finding a mentor, the magic of training and rigorous discipline, the totality of the present moment, the acceptance of the death of the ego, and the transcendence of life beyond death -- all in a fast-moving, involving story.  It's a hard act to follow.  This is by far the best of Millman's subsequent novels.  It is a much more mature book from a more mature writer for a more mature reader.  While the author is still concerned with many of the same themes, he brings in many others with greater depth and seriousness -- devasating loss, ethnic violence, evil, vengence and much more.  Who knew that old trickster Socrates came from and through such a dark place?  A must read.	2005-10-09

This is not the definitive account of the 1906 quake but the account of what Mr. Winchester found to be interesting -- fortunately it is interesting for the reader too.    The book is a wonderful geology book for the non-science reader as Mr. Winchester lays out why the quake occurred where it occurred (see the maps within) with vignettes with the fallout from the quake. He also makes clear that the next San Francisco earthquake is just down the road and we are no more prepared for that one either. The book cover itself is innovative and almost worth the price of the book.

Percy's touch is honest without being journalistic; poetic without appearing over-embroidered; and in his own eccentric person he provides the subject matter which is required to make such a work interesting. He steps out of the late 19th/early 20th century Mississippi delta as a character that could not have existed anywhere else. Affected, genteel, kind, elitist, romantic and with a view of race more in keeping with British Imperial \\"white man's burden\\" line of thought than anything American in origin - Percy the character remains fascinating even as the modern reader disagrees with his positions. A clearly and well told tale of an extinct breed (the gentrified southern aristocrat), a lost land (the Mississippi delta of the turn of the 20th century), and a buried epoch (the pre desegregation era). An excellent book - well worth reading not only to better understand a particular aspect of American history but for the pleasure of reading a well written book, regardless of the subject matter.	2005-10-09

She has to deal with painful memories when her ex-husband and his new lady love show up to attend an awards ceremony honoring their son-in-law Peter.  He is supposed to be a shoo-in for a prestigious appointment at Oxford's Mercy College.  They are shocked when he is not chosen.  The man that is chosen, Edgar Stone, is a womanizer and is not well liked. <br /> <br />Stone is found dead, and Peter is accused.  Catherine does everything she can to prove he's innocent.  Unfortunately the police have a call from Stone saying that Peter is there threatening him with a knife right before he's found dead. <br /> <br />Her daughter and ex-husband have hired a solicitor, but he doesn't seem to be much help.  Her relationship with her daughter is tenuous at best, and these circumstances really wear on it.  Plus Catherine and her ex-husband run into each other more than Catherine would want.  This adds a lot of tension in the family. <br /> <br />I am not a big fan of mysteries set in England.  I think one of the reasons I like this series is that it is an American who has moved to England.  So often she will explain the idiosyncrasies I would otherwise not understand.   <br /> <br />Catherine is an enjoyable character.  I like seeing England through her eyes.

Instead of writing a highly sensationalised account, Mr. Stenn uses a lot of solid research and facts, not rehashing and keeping alive the same old trashy rumors and character assassinations.  He even disproves the most infamous urban legend of them all, the one about Clara and the USC football team.  What does emerge is the portrait of a very sad vulnerable tragic person.  Clara came from dirt-poor Brooklyn roots, with mental illness running in her family, moving often in childhood, picked on by her peers and terribly abused at home.  And like many abused children, she made excuses for it, believing they did it for her own good, that it was in her own best interest that her mother tried to kill her, that her father often beat her and once raped her.  Her luck really began changing when she went west and broke into movies, after winning a local talent contest at the age of sixteen, and for a time enjoyed a semblance of happiness.  However, her career began to decline in the early Thirties after a number of scandals (contrary to another urban legend, it wasn't really because of the coming of sound, although she did have a terrible case of microphone-phobia), and she finally left Paramount, feeling it in her own best interest.  During this time, she married Rex Bell, who for a time provided her with a very happy secure life, as well as the two sons she adored and tried to be the ideal mother to.  However, her past caught up with her and she eventually had to go to a number of doctors and psychiatrists, falling victim to the same schizophrenia that her mother and other female relatives had suffered from, and died at the relatively young age of sixty.<br /><br />It would be too easy for a biographer to paint a picture of Clara as a sleazy party-crazy bed-hopping woman of loose morals and ill repute who just got lucky, but Mr. Stenn instead paints a picture of a woman who was just a sweet scared vulnerable person who never really had a childhood, who just wanted love, security, and acceptance, and tried to get it in all of the wrong ways.  She deserved so much better than abusive parents, a manager who exploited her, a studio that rarely put her in anything but predictable formula pictures instead of more serious dramatic roles, a press that repeatedly made up disgusting allegations against her (whether of a sexual nature or not), people who still believe these ridiculous stories that were manufactured decades ago, and a society that didn't fully understand the schizophrenia she suffered from, the disease that fully began showing itself after she was no longer acting.man who was just a sweet scared vulnerable person who never really had a childhood, who just wanted love, security, and acceptance, and tried to get it in all of the wrong ways.

Let me start by saying I never took economics in college.  I took one look at the course listing and, frankly, got seriously depressed.  So I heard all the buzz about this book and I thought, whatever.  Not for me.<br /><br />Turns out this book is exactly for me (and people like me).  It's written in clear, concise language, it makes logical conclusions, and it reminds us that correlation is not always causation.<br /><br />There's been a lot of hullabaloo about the authors' discussion of the impact of Roe v. Wade on the declining crime rate.  What's funny is that my mom, a special education teacher in a public school for, oh, 20 years, told me the exact same thing about 6 years ago.  So I wasn't as shocked by this as other people were.  (Go Mom!)  In any case, this is a perfect example of how the authors turn assumptions on their heads to make a new, logical, conclusion.<br /><br />The section on parenting is also great, particularly for all those parents who are constantly stressed out if they don't read to their children the requisite 45 minutes a day (or whatever the experts say it is now).<br /><br />I love books like this.  It will make you think about things differently.  And isn't that what good reading should do?	2005-10-09

But this - maybe much well less known, translated (into something very readable) from Latin, about exiled Trojans who settle in Italy and ultimately found Rome - is at least as worthwhile, and even a better place to start (shorter overall than either, its first half is modelled on 'Odyssey' and its second on 'Iliad').	2005-10-09

All things happen for a reason--even the bad.  <br /> <br />Rese Barrett has recently purchased a vineyard in Sonoma with the intention of restoring it to its former glory and then opening an inn. After hiring Lance Michelli as chef and making him a partner in her business, she discovers that his grandmother, Antonia, used to live there. But they both possess titles to the property. In order to put things right, Rese and Lance travel to his home in the Bronx to discuss the problem with Antonia, whose health is now failing.  <br /> <br />Over seventy years before, Antonia was forced to suddenly leave following the murder of her father--and she had never been able to return. This story highlights the extreme culture shock that Rese experiences while visiting Lance's very Italian family. Having survived an attack on her life as a child by her own schizophrenic mother, Rese has learned to survive by overachievement and shutting people out. Though it is very difficult for her, through interactions with Lance's relatives, she learns what family is about and how to open up to others.  <br /> <br />Lance presents his grandmother her old diary that he found at the vineyard. As Antonia reads the old diary, she begins to tell Lance her own story, and together they dig into what really happened when she was forced to leave her home. What they find out shakes them both to the core of their faith and threatens Lance's newfound relationship with Rese.  <br /> <br />Set in modern-day Little Italy, as well as Sonoma of Antonia's youth and being a newlywed in 1931, this book is a sequel to Kristin Heitzman's earlier book, Secrets.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Unforgotten is a moving love story that is full of lessons on reconciliation, self-sacrifice, the curse of a vendetta, and the power of forgiveness.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

He stumbles upon a Shingami's (Death God's) notebook, or Death Note.  The notebook has a dark power: a brief way to put it would be to say when you write down a person's name and have the image of them in your mind, they will die of a heart-attack in forty seconds.  There is much more to it than that, however.  Details can be added as to how and when they die, but they must be physically possible.   <br /> <br />Ryuk, the Death God whose notebook Light has found, was also bored.  He deliberately left the notebook there for a human to find.  He is a very strange character with a very strange appearance.  Nevertheless, he does play an important role. <br /> <br />Light's name seems almost contradictory.  He says he is killing off violent criminals to make the world a better place.  He claims that he is righteous.  But is murder the righteous thing to do?  Interpol begins to move and is forced to play it's trump card: L, a person whose face and full name are not even known to the NPA.   <br /> <br />L and Light are both brilliant.  Their plans, deductions, and observations never cease to amaze.  Their battle and search continues as it evolves into a race to discover who the other is.  Ultimately, you don't know who to cheer on.  The protagonist is a bit crazy and is continously commiting murder and playing with peoples lives.  Yet you find yourself still reading.  The plot is engrossing; it is rare for me to find a manga that keeps me glued to the pages without frequent action scenes. <br /> <br />Dark, mysterious, and decidedly different, Death Note is a level above.	2005-10-09

And I must say, that, while I was hungry for the knowledge and history of Wicca, this book left me cold, left me wanting something else. In short, the curiosity and respect that I had for the Wiccan spiritual path almost left me after reading this book. Thank the Goddess that I chose to pursue more 'thinking' writers in the pagan community before throwing in my vote.   Before you judge me based on the rating I am giving this book, consider a few problematic issues with Cabot's theories and practice...  1.A Salem, MA born Cabot claims to trace her family lineage down to the \\"witches that were burned at Salem\\". Okay. first of all, there were NO witches burned at Salem. Try hung. And furthermore, most of those that were accused of Witchcraft were probably puritans and anglicans, not witches.   2. Cabot claims that if you set your mind and meditate hard enough on the things that you want, they will come about. She gives a story about how she is able to visualze a parking spot at the mall right up front... if she visualizes it hard enough, then ABRA CADABRA there it is!!!!   3. Cabot insists that Wiccans should dress in 'traditional garb'. Tell me, what the hell is traditional garb? If you want to get technical, traditional wiccan garb is skyclad, as Gardner's followers did. And this commotion about wearing dramatic and dark makeup???? WHo the hell does this woman think she is? She is just begging for attention!!  4. And quite possibly the most dangerous of all, the apparant supremancy that she seems to think that women have over men. I am fully aware that we need to continue focusing on and giving praise where praise is due where women are concerned if we are to keep our supposed rights, but she almost writes this book as if men have no place in Wicca, because women are so much better sorcerers. Whatever happened to the balance? What about the God and the Goddess????   Cabot, along with Raven Silverwolf, Raven Grimassi and other similar fluffy bunnies are harming Wicca more than they are helping it. They rewrite history in order to make it coincide with their beliefs. This only makes our faith look even more obscure to the innocent on-looker who knows little to nothing about Wicca. If we are to be taken seriously we need to shun liars such as Cabot from the Wiccan community  If you are new to the craft, try 'philosopy of Wicca' by Amber laine Fisher, 'deepening witchcraft' by Grey Cat, or Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Pracitioner\\" by Scott Cunningham (A true classic!!)   But, don't take my word for it... Go ahead...research my argument for yourself.  \\"Question everything\\"	2005-10-09

It is not written at a theoretical level but is a nuts-and-bolts primer for small campaigns.  I have other books on the subject, but this is the one I recommend most highly. <br /> <br />I find that many people who want to run for political office at the local level really have no idea about the mechanics of a campaign.  By the time they realize that it is no easy task, they are too far gone or too dejected to turn their campaigns around.  This book is an excellent guide for them to read before they start.  I like the fact that Judge Grey demands a basic analysis of what it will take to win before a candidate commits himself.   <br /> <br />I also think the judge's willingness to make recommendations (i.e. don't run as an independent, his insistence that no campaign is too small for a campaign manager) sets his book apart from others.  The title of this book is \\"How to WIN a Local Election\\", not how to run one.  In fact, he capitalizes the word \\"WIN\\" himself. Often times these books are written by political science professors who lose sight of the objective of a political campaign-- to \\"WIN\\" ! <br /> <br />In short, this is an excellent primer for small local campaigns.  Good enough that I buy copies to give to potential candidates before they throw their hat in the ring.	2005-10-09

Ingenious in its conception and carefully crafted, the author has created a unique and dazzling work of fiction. Divided into three parts, the book tells the story of a most unusual life, that of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille.<br /><br />The first part of the book establishes that he was born to a woman who was hung from a gibbet for having left him to die. It turns out that Jean-Baptiste is an unusual baby. He gives people the willies, because, unlike most babies, Jean-Baptiste has no scent.<br /><br />Over time, Jean-Baptiste develops into a boy with a secret gift. His olfactory sense is developed to a degree unheard of in humans. He delights in parsing the odors around him. Ugly, friendless, and a loner, he eventually ventures into the city of Paris, a malodorous and pungent cornucopia of smells. Believe me, there is plenty to sniff out in eighteenth century Paris! Jean-Baptiste savors each whiff, and the book conveys these olfactory delights with meticulous, descriptive precision.<br /><br />His bleak existence is transformed, however, when he one day captures a heady scent of such exquisite beauty that he finds himself obsessed with it. Determined to have that scent at all costs, he eventually sniffs it out. It turns out to be the scent of a young virgin on the cusp of flowering into a woman. It is a scent that he must possess. What he does to do so will surely chill the reader.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste eventually maneuvers to get himself apprenticed to a perfumer, so that he can have the opportunity to learn the trade and create scents. He leads a bleak existence, subsisting as little more than a slave to the perfumer for whom he works.<br /><br />The second part of the book begins when Jean-Baptiste leave his employer and goes on a personal pilgrimage, leading an austere existence away from civilization for many years. There, he withdraws into himself even further, living a totally self-sustaining, hermitic existence. He ultimately realizes what other have sensed about him. Jean-Baptiste has no personal scent. He simply does not smell.<br /><br />With this knowledge, he returns to civilization where, having lived as practically an animal for many years, he creates a fictitious and adventurous scenario to account for his filthy and disgusting appearance. Subsequently, he is taken under the wing of some local nobility and feted and pampered. Realizing the importance of scent, he creates a personal scent for himself. He now realizes that he who has the power over scent can rule supreme. He intends to do so.<br /><br />The third part of the book has Jean-Baptiste migrating to a town that is the hub for the scent trade. Perfumes, oils, and soaps are the stock in trade for this town and, as such, beckon brightly to Jean-Baptiste. Once there, he again smells a scent so delectable that he longs to possess it. He knows that scent for what it is and now knows that it is the scent, and not the personal charms of its bearer, that captures the attention and devotion of others. Jean Baptiste wants to harness that scent at all costs. He desperately desires the power to make others love him. He wants to be supreme.<br /><br />It is his desperate desire to harness and possess that celestial scent that causes Jean-Baptiste, a socio-path with little empathy for others, to prey upon the maidens of the town in order to obtain that which he needs. It is his obsession that lays at the heart of the vortex that arises in the town, as murder after murder occurs. Yet, no one suspects him. What ultimately happens leads to an almost unbelievable climax, when Jean-Baptiste finds himself consumed by the passion he has managed to arouse in others through scent.<br /><br />This is a heady, quirky, and compelling debut novel, like nothing I have ever before read. Complex and lyrical in its telling, it is a novel that stays with the reader long after the last page is turned. Bravo!tely realizes what other have sensed about him.

This is the French text edition of an epic work by its Swedish author. Translated from Swedish into English, this beautifully written book of historical fiction was first published in 1954 and met with excellent reviews at the time. It is the second part of a four part opus, the first of which is \\"The Emigrants\\". This book, \\"Unto a Good Land\\", is followed by two additional books, \\"The Settlers\\" and \\"Last Letter From Home\\".<br /><br />In the first volume, \\"The Emigrants\\", the author detailed the emigration of a Swedish family to the New World, grounding it in the reasons for the exodus of so many Swedes from their mother country in the middle of the 19th century. The focus of the first book in this four part opus is on the family, relatives, and friends of Karl Oscar Nilsson, a peasant farmer who unceasingly worked his farm, only to find that, no matter what he did, he could not progress and would continue to live on the cusp of total poverty. The focus of the first book is on their life in Sweden. Gathering up his family and friends of the family, the Nilsson family decides to take the monumental step of making a fresh start by emigrating to the new world, specifically the United States of America.<br /><br />The second volume, \\"Unto a Good Land\\", focuses on the arrival of the Nilsson family and friends in the United States of America. It details their journey from New York, a journey that was to take them across the Midwest by rail, steamer, and foot to arrive in the wilds of what would one day be the State of Minnesota. It is in this wilderness that the Nilsson family and friends would homestead and struggle to make a new home. The author regales the reader with the travails this hardy group of settlers would encounter in their efforts to create by the sweat of their brow a new home in the wilderness. The early struggles of the Nilsson family to succeed in what was an unknown frontier is engagingly chronicled. I have enjoyed the first and second volumes so much that I look forward to continuing their journey with them by reading the remaining two volumes. This is a book that those who love historical fiction will greatly enjoy.at I look forward to continuing their journey with them by reading the remaining two volumes.

An assortment of over-simplified views on business management.	I read selective chapters of this book in advising a student's translation project.  I'm not an expert in the business field but I found this book (at least the chapters I read) filled with over-simplified views on business activities.<br /><br />Dunlap was laureated as the \\"Company turnaround specialist\\" by admirers.  He described his experience of saving companies from bankrupting and making their stock prices climb.  Here's my few thoughts about the ideas preached in this book:<br /><br />1) Dunlap's ideas are nothing original. For example, he repeatedly emphasize in the book that the vital method of running a business is to \\"cut unnecessary cost\\" and \\"maximize efficiency\\" of the management team.  One can find \\"insights\\" like these in any college business management textbook.  Members of the former management team would look dumb if the their total efforts and wisdom added together didn't outweigh Dunlap's.  Is it possible?<br /><br />2) People are considered nothing more than \\"human resources\\" (resources basically, just happened to be human) utilized by the firm in profit-generation.  That's Tenet One in Capitalist Management Ideology and I don't wanna challenge its moral basis.  \\"Driving people to achieve their best through pushing and rewarding\\" is no discovery of New Continent to any CEO (or college kid).  I was surprised when I read Dunlap, filled with self-complacency, described how he acted according to the above \\"insights\\" in carrying out \\"corporate resuscitation\\".  But then, what couldn't be done if people are not treated as distinct humans but corporate consumables?  In the eyes of people like Dunlap (people in sympathy with his views are everywhere), stock price or accumulation of capital rather than people in the first place are viewed as the primary goals.  I beg to differ with this mentality.<br /><br />3) The idea of Dunlap, whether flattered by the superficial media or explicitly self-boosting, as the savior of failing companies is strongly in doubt.  The climbing up of a company's stock price after Dunlap took charge might not be simply the result of his \\"insightful leadership\\".  Stock price is a multiple-factors controlled variable.

US	38193789	RJ7G6PP2BVFJD	0060155744	960524426	The Myth of Soviet Military Supremacy	Books	3	5	7	N	N	book reviews	Los Angeles Times <br />September 7, 1986 <br /> <br />It is with good reason that Tom Gervasi titles his book \\"The Myth of Soviet Military Superiority.\\" He thinks the story of the Soviet Union's preponderance in arms is all a big fabrication. Not only are the Soviets behind us in strategic weapons, he says, but they are behind in intermediate range and tactical nuclear arms in land forces and conventional strength on the European front, and in overall military spending. <br /> <br />Gervasi goes on to argue that the Reagan Administration's massive defense buildup has been sold to the U.S. public with lies and manipulated information, and that the Administration has systematically suppressed dissent by using threats, punishments and selective favors. <br /> <br />As a result, Gervasi concludes, most of the main-stream press and think-tanks have been dragooned into a conspiracy of deceit. The real reason the United States is amassing ever-greater arsenals, Gervasi states, is because the defense industrialists want to increase their already-swollen profits. <br /> <br />Perhaps because of the iconoclastic views presented, this book is sure to be quoted frequently, and its message will be widely spread. Gervasi, the director of the Center for Military Research and Analysis in New York, has amassed formidable statistical information. The appendixes, footnotes, end notes and index constitute more than half of the volume. The dust jacket notes with pride that \\"comprehensive notes and appendixes document where every piece of evidence was obtained.\\" So the quality of the author's command of facts, his care in argumentation, and his identification of sources become crucial in judging the book's value. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Gervasi indulges in much the same use of half-truths and tailored arguments for which he so justifiably excoriates his opponents. Regarding bombers, for example, Gervasi calls them and their weapons the \\"most important\\" (emphasizing megatonnage), \\"most accurate\\" of all, and highly dependable in reaching their targets. In supporting these assertions, however, he obscures the distinction between bombers which would penetrate Soviet air space at some risk to drop bombs or launch missiles, and aircraft which would stand off in relative safety and launch cruise missiles from a distance. Regarding submarine-launched ballistic missiles, he talks about the U.S. SLBMs of today being superior in accuracy to Soviet land-based rockets. While the U.S. Trident II D-5 missiles of tomorrow may have these characteristics, presently deployed U.S. SLBMs do not. One is left with a suspicion that the virtues of bombers and submarines are exaggerated and the effectiveness of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles minimized because Soviet strength is concentrated in the last category. <br /> <br />Regarding U.S. command and control, Gervasi argues that there is not \\"necessarily any need for a communications system that is sure to survive a nuclear attack. A retaliatory attack does not have to rely on such a system.\\" A hundred pages later, the author discusses the threat to Soviet command and control posed by Pershing-II missile deployments. There he quotes Defense Electronics magazine approvingly: \\"The removal of C2 (command and control) capability by a comparatively small number of Pershings would render much of the Soviet ICBM first strike and retaliatory forces impotent.\\" Gervasi seems to be arguing the case both ways. <br /> <br />According to Gervasi, U.S. Establishment spokesmen claim that American use of nuclear weapons in Europe would carry \\"no risk\\" of escalation to an intercontinental exchange. Perhaps one or two spokesmen have made such foolish claims, but there surely cannot have been very many of them. Gervasi also asserts, in arguing the balance of land forces in Europe, that Soviet forces \\"in the Leningrad, Baltic, Byelorussian and Carpathian military districts . . . are not in Europe.\\" <br /> <br />In quite afew cases, Gervasi's end notes do not support his statements in the text. For example, he cites a 1949 interview of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles to claim that Dulles acknowledged that there was then no real evidence of a threat from the Soviet Union. This did not sound like the Dulles I knew, so I looked up Gervasi's end note, which cited \\"interview, U.S. News and World Report (March, 1949).\\" The citation carried no reference, incidentally, to the volume, number, date or page in the magazine, and I went through all four weekly issues of that month finding no interview. <br /> <br />Looking through other issues of the same year, I did find an interview with Dulles published on Jan. 21, 1949. That interview did not carry the words attributed to Dulles by Gervasi, however, and Dulles' tone was not as represented. Dulles said: \\"You have a tense situation like a dry autumn in the wood when any fool can start a fire. . . . Soviet communism teaches that, while you must work for the overthrow of non-communist governments, you have to pick your time. . . . The peoples of Western Europe . . . feel naked. . . . Russian Communists' . . . methods are violent. . . .\\" <br /> <br />Take another example. On Page 145, Gervasi asserts that \\"America paid $122 billion in 1982 alone to equip and maintain its forces in Europe.\\" The author's end note cites a 1983 article by Earl C. Ravenal -- even though, in his text, Gervasi attributes the information to the General Accounting Office. Comparing Gervasi's language with Ravenal's, one discovers that Gervasi misquoted Ravenal's figure by a few billion dollars and got the year wrong. <br /> <br />What Ravenal had done was to break down the total 1984 Defense Department budget request of $274 billion into European concerns, Asian concerns, Rapid Deployment Forces, and strategic programs. He then assigned more than 40% of the total to Europe, figuring that Europe was America's central military commitment. This gave Europe a prorated 40% share of all Defense appropriations of any kind -- from those supporting Army divisions in the United States, to new weapons development, service academies, recruiting stations, Pentagon operations, etc. Ravenal's organization of his data was odd, but at least he explained what he was doing. Gervasi uses Ravenal's figures to argue that U.S. forces stationed in Europe as a \\"token of support\\" for NATO cost egregious sums and -- besides -- are really maintained there to subjugate our European allies. <br /> <br />If the examples just given were representative of but a few aberrations in generally careful documentation, it would be one thing; but one could go on and on with additional instances of arguments and citations gone astray. It is a pity, because Gervasi has presented some truths. A powerful case can be made for much of what he believes. A few of his suspicions about the Reagan Administration are well founded without a doubt. The idea of Soviet military supremacy probably is a myth. I am reminded of a remark made by Madame de Stael about the Russians almost two centuries ago: \\"If they do not attain their objective, they always go past it.\\" Whether or not this be true of the Soviets, it does seem descriptive of Tom Gervasi <br /> <br />The Toronto Star, January 17, 1987 <br />The arms race: When enough is never enough <br /> <br /> TOM Gervasi is director of the Centre for Military Research and Analysis in New York and, one assumes, eminently qualified to write \\"the most comprehensive and fully documented analysis of the relative military capabilities of the two superpowers that has ever been published.\\" <br /> <br />Indeed, the problems this book poses have less to do with credibility than with tone. It reads suspiciously like an election manifesto for the Democrats, bashing Republicans with the stick of economic profligacy at every turn. <br /> <br />Gervasi's thesis is straightforward enough - in fact he sums it up himself in his opening paragraph: \\"I am acitizen who believes that our nation must have a strong defence. What I have found is that we already have one.\\" <br /> <br />And if that's not simplistic enough for you the rest of the book will make no sense at all. <br /> <br />The American taxpayers, then, have apparently been hoodwinked into shelling out billions to expand their nation's defence (or is it offence?) capabilities under the assumption that such expenditure is necessary to maintain strategic superiority over the Soviets who, Gervasi claims, are in reality hopelessly far behind in the arms race. <br /> <br />The main culprit, it seems, is the Star Wars program, which is, Gervasi insists, still closer to science-fiction than science-fact. <br /> <br />\\"According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, the most powerful lasers we can build are more than a million times below the power level that would be needed to do any damage to more than a small fraction of the Soviet missile force in the time available and over the ranges required.\\" <br /> <br />It is, the author says, suspect logic that leads the U. S. government to pour such vast amounts of money into a scheme without any real evidence that it could possibly save anyone, but even more suspect logic that little effort is expended on what he fervently believes is a real solution: An international agreement to ban nuclear weapons of every kind. Another source of worry, and thus destabilization, is that the Soviets fear Star Wars technology will be used to knock out Soviet defence satellites long before it needs to be employed against missiles. <br /> <br />So often, indeed, does this book invoke our sympathies towards the fears of the Soviets that one begins to wonder where the author has been during the last 40 years of Soviet expansionism. <br /> <br />Since over 200 pages of this book are statistical charts listing such things as how many missiles, what kind of warheads, where situated, and so on, one feels somewhat churlish questioning the factuality of Gervasi's facts. Yet it must be done. <br /> <br />Indeed, statistics often seem a more potent weapon in the hands of politicians than the warheads themselves. <br /> <br />Since 1982, courtesy of President Ronald Reagan, the American public has been chastened with the knowledge that the Soviets have a definite margin of superiority in the arms race. According to Gervasi, this statement is a shameless lie based on juggled numbers and covert politicking by the Pentagon. <br /> <br />Yet the fact remains that, in the heated controversy that has arisen in the States over this book, Gervasi seems to have been out-accused by better informed sources. With all the boundless freedom available in the freedom-of-information act, we must accept the simple truth that, in matters of such complexity, we will always be at the mercy and ulterior motives of interpreters of one sort or the other. <br /> <br />The real strength of the book remains in Gervasi's sobering reminders about the realities of nuclear war. <br /> <br />Even with the most efficient defence system imaginable the chances are that several major cities would be destroyed. <br /> <br />Remembering the aftermath of the relatively minor destruction in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this thought alone should underline the absurdity of any notion of defence more effectively than volumes of statistics. <br /> <br />As for the generals and their demands upon the public purse, Gervasi correctly observes that enough is never enough.	2005-10-09

I asked Jorgenson about this, and he agreed. Say your salary is $100,000 a year today, but you take home $80,000 after taxes. <br /> <br />Your company is still paying that extra $20,000. In a FairTax world, it will save that money, and be able to lower its prices accordingly, only if it can reduce your salary to $80,000. In other words, your take-home pay is the same as before. Sure, you'd get to \\"keep 100 percent of your paycheck,\\" as Boortz and Linder repeatedly write, but it would be a smaller paycheck. That's kind of a big thing to leave out.  <br /> <br />I pressed the point with Boortz and Linder. Boortz denies that the book intentionally overpromises. The introduction, he notes, emphasizes that \\"this book isn't about saving a penny in taxes.\\" But he concedes that the book is confusing about this, and vows to correct it in later printings. Fair enough.&#8221; <br /> <br />Meanwhile, these guys want to replace the entire tax code, they've ignited a populist movement to get it done, and tens of thousands of copies of the uncorrected book make the FairTax sound like magic.&#8221; <br />	2005-10-09

While Slaka did not survive Balkanized glasnost, Molvania lives.<br /><br />As a repeat traveler to not only Prague but the bucolic countryside of Bohemia and the Hungarian puzsta plains near Romania, I confess this book triumphed. On every page, without fail, I chuckled--often more than once. And I rarely laugh out loud at movies, unless it's caused by unintentionally funny plaints or exertions by artistes. As other reviewers have noted, the Molvanian jokes do get stale--like much of the native cuisine I gather--on extended exposure. This traveller's guide is best savored while a few minutes on the toilet, waiting for your computer to boot, or while being put on hold on the phone--the closest counterpart to an inimitably Molvanian experience.<br /><br />My two pre-teen sons love its illustrations and captions; much of the fun is not only in the text but the deadpan earnestness of the layout, the boldfaced emphases, the maps and not least future offerings in the Jet Lag Series blurbed on the back pages. For the educated P.C. reader seeking novelty, this vademecum will surpass any common guide meant for the hoi polloi.<br /><br />Any customer of Rough Guides/Lonely Planets will recognize not only their feel but their ambiance, as reassuring platitudes of the politically correct phrasing guaranteed to offend no culture mesh into the timid warnings for Westerners gingerly tiptoeing off the beaten track. The potted biographies of hapless or jaded contributors, the photo/text matches, the sober histories and the determinedly fair-minded rankings of accomodations, eateries, and attractions make for hilariously stereotypical reading, within which any armchair or experienced journeyer will ruefully recognize not only one's self but countless ranks of conniving clerks, finagling waitpersons, surly vendors, supercilious guides, gesturing drivers, and fearsomely (non?)communicative forays beyond phrasebooks. As the book instructs us, the departure fee from Molvania may be 3000 strubli, \\"but most visitors agree it's well worth the price.\\" The entry fee's far cheaper and no less valuable an encounter, in the Jet Lag new but already time-honored tradition of \\"taking you places where you don't want to go.\\"perienced journeyer will ruefully recognize not only one's self but countless ranks of conniving clerks, finagling waitpersons, surly vendors, supercilious guides, gesturing drivers, and fearsomely (non?)communicative forays beyond phrasebooks.

Soft spoken, and direct, honest to a fault, and full of the love for God. Bill has something that burns in his heart that he wants to tell you, and this is the only way that a man of his humilty could find to say it.<br /><br />Those unique traits are reflected in this work of historical fiction, The Bishop's Ring. Its the story of common people caught up in uncommon, even mystical, events. As Bill unfolds his story from the ancient world to the old world, and then into the new world, he never lets the reader forget, that even in the most delicately innocent moments of our seemingly ordinary lives, the forces of Good and Evil are at work both inside and around us. Most of us, will never know how close we are to the battle of evermore, so Mr.Debottis, has opened the blinds for us to see outside our normally closed minds.<br /><br />Bill will tell you that there are no coincidences. As you try to unravel this page-turner of a crime story, you will see, that in the lives of his imaginary characters, in your life, in his life, and in mine, he is surely right. The line between coincidence, and the will of God is undefinable.<br /><br />This book will be a special treat for any American, whose roots are in Poland. For some of the older folks, who may have emigrated to the US from there, it will be both heartwarming, and emotionally draining, as they retrace the days after WW2 when the forces of Atheism in the name of Communisim crushed the lives of a Catholic people. Its also a stark reminder to all of us that the jack boots will always make it to the door, if they are not stopped at the city gate.	2005-10-09

The book should be accessible to anyone with a high school reading level and does not require a lot of background in other sciences or math. Even the bit about the genetic code is kept to a bare minimum. This would be a great way to 'catch up' with the general concepts of evolution without dedicating several years of your life to earning a college degree in biology.<br /><br />Zimmer covers most of the major concepts. The first couple chapters provide a historical treatment of Darwin, his journey on the Beagle and his development of his theory of evolution through the mechanism of natural selection. From there, the fossil record and history of life on Earth are covered, then current examples of research demonstrating evolution in action. Other chapters deal with the 'tree of life', genes of animal development, extinctions (the section dealing with the current human-caused mass extinction runs on just a tad too long), coevolution, medically relevant instances of evolution, sex and evolution, two chapters on human evolution, and a final chapter on religious implications of the theory.<br /><br />About that last, I will just say that any religion which requires adherents to deny reality is not a good religion. Evolution does not exclude belief in God anymore than the heliocentric theory, but some people wish to place their God in gaps of our knowledge, many of which are being closed or shrunk by scientific progress.<br /><br />The index could be more complete. For example, there is a subsection of chapter 5 entitled 'The Mangrove of Life', but mangrove is not in the index.<br /><br />The scientific accuracy is pretty darn good. Zimmer was able to include most of the latest fossil info on whale ancestors discovered in the last couple decades; he mentions the possiblity that this new data could result in a taxonomic rearrangement and indeed that has been generally accepted since this book came out. Whales are now believed to have descended from artiodactyls, not mesonychids. One other scientific quibble (I am a molecular biologist): Ziller presents the 'mangrove of life' with a revised 'tree of life' figure on page 107. I wish he had pointed out that the individual lineages that swapped genes horizontally all must have shared an earlier common ancestor. Horizontal gene transfer is pointless without a shared genetic code, which itself is evidence of common descent. These are small quibbles in such a great book.<br /><br />One note of caution to overly protective parents who wish to shield their children from anything sexual: You may want to read the section on bonobo culture (pages 255-256) before giving this book to your children.	2005-10-09

This is incredible. It is certainly no wonder that this is enjoyed better than \\"Left Behind\\" by some. My wife owns all the LB books, and I got as far as book #3, \\"Nicholae\\", impressed, but not really willing to go further. I couldn't put this down!!<br /><br />So he takes book 2, almost cuts it in half compared to the other 2 books in this trilogy, and just has you squirming on the edge of your seat the whole time! We catch up with Decker and Christopher, and by the end of this, we know who sweet Christopher really is. And although he has very little mention, when he is mentioned, you know a little more about the mysterious Master Djwlij Kajm, and that makes you squirm too. Some of the scenes in this are frightening. Like the locust part. Wow! Hey, it's already in Revelation, and after the way BeauSeigneur described them, I don't want to be around to feel the sting of those suckers!<br /><br />If there is one thing that is convincing, it is the lies of Satan, plain and simple. Just read this, you won't have any doubts. And the way BeauSeigneur writes this is none other than gifted, as well as annointed. Yeah, HE even admits that the trilogy title might be a touchy subject for some people, but I think we can all agree, the point here is to be touched. And to be touched by something greater than we can ever possibly imagine! Book #3 should be amazing, and I'm expecting nothing less!	2005-10-09

I wanted to buy \\"Dialogue\\" from the \\"Elements of Fiction Writing\\" series but the reviews were horrible. I instead bought \\"Writing Dialogue\\". The book was horrible, a waste of time and money. I was starting to think there was no such thing as a decent dialogue book. Perhaps no more than one or two dozen pages could be written on the subject. <br /> <br />Gloria Kempton in her excellent \\"Dialogue\\" book from the new \\"Write Great Fiction\\" series from the excellent \\"Writer's Digest Books\\" publisher laid my fears to rest. I was very jaded from my horrible experiance with \\"Writing Dialogue\\" and read this book with a very poor attitude to start. As the chapters went by, I found my self liking the book and learning excellent points. By the time I got to chapter five, Narrative, Dialogue, and Action, she had won me over. <br /> <br />I learned much from her. Some highlights: <br /> <br />Make your scenes three dimensional. Narration, action, dialogue. <br /> <br />Don't bother with huge multi-page descriptions of your charactors to get a handle on their emotions and drives. All humans fall into nine catagories. Place your charactors in one of these catagories and 90 percent of your work is done. I am number five, the observer. My wife is number nine, the peacemaker. <br /> <br />To really get to know a charactor write a few page monolog of them speaking to you. <br /> <br />The power of dialogue to do many things, quicken the pace, add excitement and emotion, touch the reader's heartstrings, control the scope of the novel. <br /> <br />Different types of novels and the type of dialogue they require. <br /> <br />A must buy by anyone serious about writing. <br /> <br />PS I have had excellent results from the \\"Writer's Digest Books\\" publisher. I have most of their \\"Elements of Fiction Writing Books\\" and an working on getting all of their new \\"Write Great Fiction\\" books. They seemed to have kicked it up a few notches with this new series. Top notch stuff!	2005-10-09

Other than that I would give this book a 10!!!!! In fact I am rereading it. Something I almost never do. As promised by Dr. Crabb this is a no holds bared journey to the depths of our souls and beyond. His insights into the sin nature we all struggle with and the cure for all evils, at times took my breathe away. More importantly my life has been changed by them. I am now much more at peace with myself and others. I no longer expect so much from them and neither do I expect so much from myself. There is much less struggle for \\"what is mine\\" and much more concern for what others need. Only read this book if you want the whole truth and nothing but the truth about the human condition... and yours too.	2005-10-09

He writes of Larkin in this biography with respect and candor, and not as a hero-worshiper (or disparager). Larkin's life, because of his reclusive nature, was not an open book, and he had a dark side, which contrasts greatly with the kind of lyrical, often witty (though at times bitter) poetry he produced.<br /><br />Larkin wrote poetry from an early age, though his first desire was to be a novelist. In fact he wrote two novels, neither of which made much of a hit, and he could write no others. He worked every day as a librarian at Brynmor Jones Library in Hull. He loved traditional jazz and wrote frequently about it. He never married, but had two mistresses; one he mistreated badly. He could be funny and also mean-spirited. There were many parts to the man, some at odds with others. Motion does a good job fleshing these sides out and dealing with them without passing judgment. It's a fair and balanced, well-written biography. Recommended.	2005-10-09

(It would be an excellent book to read in a Middle/High school class and use as a tool for class discussion on prejudice, family, death, religion, etc.)   <br />And I really found nothing humorous about the book (one of the review said it was homorous), but rather compassionate and depressing. <br />	2005-10-09

Cyril, as Athanasius, has taught in accordance with the trenched Orthodoxy of Alexandria that in Jesus there were not two natures (divine and human) but one united nature out of the Hypostatic union of the eternal Logos with Jesus humanity, at the moment of his conception by Mary, which made her bearer of God (Theotokos). Dispute of this belief was caused by a radical conceptual difference between the two Chrisologies, interpreted in Neoplatonic and Aristotalian philosophies. This was further clouded by misinterpretation of terms, and by the lack of knowledge of Greek in the West, and irrelevance of the issue in Rome.<br /><br />Rise of Monophysite Movement:<br />This well searched, clearly written, and historically supported study, by the ultimate expert on the subject, examines the psychological milieu and sociopolitical background to those troubling two centuries, from the council of Ephesus in 431 to the defeat of the Byzantines by the advent of Islam into Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, the strongholds of Cyril-Severus Henophysite doctrine.<br />Contemporary sociologists and ecclesiastic history analysts view that the aftermath of Chalcedon was in principle a refutation to Leo's authority in the East, attacking his pseudo Nestorian expression. 'Monophysitism' could be regarded as a slow accumulating separatist movement in Syria, Egypt and Armenia, using words or articles (Ek & En) as an excuse. W.H. C. Frend supported this view, asserting that regional church identity (Copt, Jacobite, or Armenian) did not start right away, to imply otherwise, in Meyendorff expression Imperial unity endured Christian divisions.<br /><br />The Thematic Study:<br />Through this study, while professor Frend kept using the 'Mono' conventional expression, the inquisitive reader can appreciate how religion was an influential medium through which the unity of the Empire was sought disregarding provincial church traditions. Frend's work does not limit its scope to the history of the Christian doctrine only, but discusses issues raised by the third and fourth councils (1st Ephesus & Chalcedon) that influenced life in Byzantium's eastern provinces of the Roman Empire, in the fifth and sixth centuries. Frend provides an articulate examination of the doctrinal issues that were essential to the unity of the Early Church, following a deeper understanding of the history of the fifth and sixth centuries.<br /><br />William H.C.

Please do not let the title of this review fool y'all because I do not mean it in a positive context. <br />First off Dr. Welsing is referring to the arayan race as some genetic offspring of albanism and that they (the world's first albino's) were casted out of their tribes where they migrated together (like the lepar colonies) and eventually migrated north into europe. Now this goes off of her theory that all life originated in Africa but now (30 years later) they are now saying that life might have originated in Asia (before or after the continental rip-who cares) but then again, if you notice the medical community will condemn a drug after frequent deaths; AFTER THE FDA APPROVED OF IT, provided by commercials and pamphlets, and if you want to take it even further, at one time the science community actually wrote and published books that said that it was factually proven that BLACKS WERE 3/4 HUMANS-So you don't believe what \\"they\\" will tell you is the bottom line. <br />now, I will read a book with an open mind and what I have found uninteresting about this book is that the great Dr. Welsing comes off on the surface as a racist and the fact that she was trying to support her thesis by her sources kind of remind me of racist nazi scientists trying to prove to their furor how the arayan race is the uber race-which is kind of creepy. <br /> <br />but...on a twisted note, i have to admit that when you dig deeper into dr. welsing's book, you will find that she reaches an obvious conclusion of racism and how it affects all person's of color.  <br />what i would suggest to the reader is to read the book and take everything with a grain of salt. <br />I also have to admit that I am not finished reading the book but it is humorous if you want shock value. <br />  <br />In summary, I do agree that we (as non-whites) must do something to stop the racist machine that condemns us (everybody) to a continual cycle of loss, anger, and pain. <br />But we (as Americans be it black,white, chinese, etc.) are living in the information age where certain truths are common knowledge and we as black people have the same opportunities as everybody else that is credited to the sacrifices of Dr. King, Malcolm X and the many other (unknowns.)and therefore it is up to us to take our lives by our own hands and manifests destiny. <br /> <br />In defense of this book, I will say that these published essays of Dr. Welsing are very old, and limited. But still, I don't find that it was necessary for all the scientifical jargon to reach an obvious conclusion and that we must be careful what to read.	2005-10-09

Ok, the writing is pretty good, but I gave this book only one star, because after originally thinking this was going to be an enjoyable series after having read \\"The Golden Compass\\", I now feel that the series' having been aimed at the children's/youth market is a total deception on both the author's and his marketing team's part to get some sort of one-sided \\"agenda\\" across. I am in no way some sort of \\"book burning, censorship fiend\\", neither am I a religious \\"zealot\\", nor a \\"prude\\" when it comes to sexual content (inferred or otherwise) in a book.

I didn't censor books when my own child was growing up, but at least the content wasn't covertly \\"put out there\\". Oh I'll finish the series and go on with \\"Amber Spyglass\\" since I've already paid for the whole boxed set and to see if there's any saving grace at all for me regarding it, but there really needs to be some kind of cautionary information for parents/guardians before they hand over this series to their kids...again, just my opinion.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

The easiest one for most of us, is to lie on the floor with your knees drawn up and lift your pelvis towards the ceiling.  (This is called the \\"bridge pose\\" in yoga).  But if you are reading this, and thinking to yourself \\"I could never do that\\", the authors have even simpler exercises, including those that you can do while lying in bed.<br /><br />For fit and active people, the best way to prevent back pain is to do yoga, ballet, belly-dancing or pilates;  in fact any kind of  exercise that gets you to tone your abdominals.

She is a retired research professor and physicist.  Her goddaughter M. C. Galigani believes her ex-boyfriend Jake Powers is stalking her.  Wayne Gallen, a former co-worker, shows up to warn her that she's in danger because of some misdirected e-mail.   <br /> <br />Then a student of M.C.'s that was an undercover private investigator is murdered.  Gloria is very concerned about the whole situation.   <br /> <br />Gloria's boyfriend, Matt Geneva, is a police detective.  He isn't very involved in this case as he has just been diagnosed with prostrate cancer.  Gloria is torn between helping M. C. and taking care of Matt. <br /> <br />Gloria uncovers an illegal medical experiment run by someone who doesn't seem to stop at murder.  Can she protect M. C. while bringing everything to light? <br /> <br />This was the first I've read in this series.  I will definitely be reading more of this series.  Gloria is such a likeable character.  I was so worried that since this series is the periodic table series, there would be too much scientific talk.  That wasn't the case.  She uses her knowledge of science, but the book is very enjoyable to those who don't know science. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book. <br />	2005-10-09

Many have probably already bought various compilations of the comic strips and looked through them again and again. So why buy THIS collection?<br /><br />  Mainly because it goes WAY beyond anything else that is already out there - and not just because it contains EVERY single one of the comic strips in one collection, nicely slipcased. Buy it  because it comes closest to reflecting what Bill Watterson, creator of these comics, wanted, exceptional color quality, pretty much up to his very perfectionistic standards. Buy it because for the first time you'll see the comic in as close to perfect form as you'll find...and yes, buy it because you'll finally have all of the strips in one set.<br /><br />  How much of a perfectionist was Watterson when it came to having control over his beloved characters? Well, imagine turning down a call from Steven Spielberg because you just aren't interested in collaborating with anyone, genius or not, on a work based on your comic strip. Imagine giving up lucrative contracts for lunch boxes, animated films, stuffed Calvin and Hobbes figures.<br /><br />  Whether you think that turning down all those potentially lucrative opportunities was admirable or crazy, there is no denying that he poured his heart, soul and psyche into his work, not distracted by meetings about the design of a lunch box or the  decal that woould appear on clothing.<br /><br />  Nope, he just did his work, day in and day out, until he decided, at an early age (around 37) that he'd done enough and simply....stopped. That was a sad day for me,as I'd grown to love Calvin and Hobbes and their unique world, one in which you never really knew the names of Calvin's parents (anyone know?), one in which his teacher could morph into a monster, one that exemplified the psyche of one little boy so well and which hasn't been equaled since.	2005-10-09

I had the vague and maybe inaccurate idea that Natalie Wood was sleeping with Nick Ray and James Dean, and that James Dean was sleeping with Sal Mineo. Whether or not these are all facts or if they're just rumors, I still don't know... the book doesn't delve too deeply into gossip.<br /><br />What I got, instead, was a detailed description of how hard it was to make this particular movie - a new kind of film, involving a maverick director (Ray), a Method super-star (Dean), and hiterto unseen realistic depiction of modern teenagers - at this particular point in history.<br /><br />A pretty gripping story, all told. The book's strongest sections are the ones dedicated to story development (several writers and drafts came and went) and to Dean's Method acting, which was still a very new phenomenon in 1955.<br /><br />If one had to nitpick, I guess I'd say the book's a bit too long and maybe a wee indiscriminate with its detail. It's exhaustively researched and talks a bit about everything (including the details of Dean's \\"cursed\\" sports car). But is there any real insight into any of the major players? Not much, really. Dean remains an ambitious cipher, and in the end comes across more like a template for today's ubiquitous, petulant, pretty-boy movie star than as some sort of trailblazer. That's unfortunate, I guess... but without direct access to the deceased himself or his closest friends, I guess that's about the most you can expect to learn about him.<br /><br />Overall: this book does a very good job of depicting the uphill climb involved in making REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE. The U.S. wasn't ready for a realistic look at teen culture. The flood gates were opened, and it looks like -- for better or worse -- there's no shutting them up again.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to film buffs, film students and screenwriters. The chapters on story development are really quite fascinating. Actors may also get a kick out of reading about Dean's method.<br /><br />I know I'm going to rent the film again right away, while the book's details are fresh in my mind.apters on story development are really quite fascinating.

I recently read and reviewed Turtledove's latest, Drive to the East,  so it was fresh in my mind. Fox on the Rhine provides the level of detail that Turtledove's series lacks. From details of individual tactical engagements to analyses of the strategic alignments, the author gives the reader a full view of the situation. The book opens when one man's tiny change from actual history results in a successful July 20, 1944 assassination of Hitler. Whether the resulting scenarios are really plausible is beside the point because the authors made them seem credible. The authors do produce an interesting alternate history tale while letting the reader in on more than broad generalizations of what is going on at the front. A few more maps would have been helpful though.<br /><br />Although Fox on the Rhine portrays the Germans on the move with a second chance, they are not glorified. The authors go a bit far in deifying Rommel, but most of the German leaders and the SS are nasty and evil as ever. A surprising feature of the book is the portrayal of the American army sweeping across France and then in counterattack mode. The Americans have practically equal billing in this book and are definitely the good guys. Readers considering Fox on the Rhine do not have to be concerned they are buying a Neo Nazi or at least sympathetic tome.<br /><br />So far, I am describing a book that will appeal to both Alternate and Military history buffs. However, there are also key aspects in a book such as character development and plot lines. In this area, Fox on the Rhine is mediocre at best and Turtledoves comes out way ahead. The characters are ciphers attached to historical stereotypes. In fact, a significant part of the book is devoted to worthless letters from an American bomber gunner to his mother. Letters from a tanker would have been much more interesting and fitting. The descriptions of the military campaigns in Fox on the Rhine are informative and interesting, but without characters to really care about, it falls flat. For the right audience, Fox on the Rhine is well worth the time, but when considering everything that comprises a good book, it is little more than ordinary.ry campaigns in Fox on the Rhine are informative and interesting, but without characters to really care about, it falls flat.

I want to start out by saying that I think Fantasia is beautiful and very talented. I didn't really get into the 2004 American Idol season, but once I heard this girl sing I fell in love w/ her voice and said she's an overnight celeb. I think her voice and style is unique and she is very pleasurable it seems. I was at the hairdresser's and he told me that Fantasia was on 20/20 last friday night and that she had a book out, so I couldn't wait to get the book from Barnes & Noble and it was virtually sold out but they said they had a few copies left and I bought one. Lemme tell you, I didn't realize that this very young women went through so many hardships in her very short life, but I\\"ll tell anyone...I look up to Fantasia and she is my Idol. I'm 26yrs old and I feel like I've been inspired to be a better person, just when you think your back is against the wall somebody else is always worst off than you. I hope that this book can move other young women like it did me. Honestly Fantasia and I have some relationship similarities minus the abuse factor...loving someone that doesn't really love you back, so her testimony hit me right in the heart.

Unfortunately, his English does not totally compensate for his lack of an over arching theme to this book which offers glimpses into The World Bank by concentrating on the activities and antics of James Wolfensohn, its very capable former \\"warrior king\\" leader. By making Wolfensohn the protagonist, the author takes away from the book's sub title: A Story of Failed States, Financial Crises, and the Wealth and Poverty of Nations.<br /><br />Even the sub title contains a number of different themes and getting one's head around them is a tall order. Joe Stiglitz, former Nobel Economics prize Winner and Wolfensohn WB side kick I feel, did this well in Globalization and Its Discontents.  However, as that book criticized the IMF which Mallaby, given his background, tends to favor, it is not the correct template for this book which gives us vignettes such as Exxon's attempts to extract oil from Chad without having the NGOs sabotage its efforts. Case studies such as Chad, Tibet and a few others might have gone a long way to meeting my expectations from the sub title.<br /><br />Instead we get a mildly interesting bio of Wolfensohn, his ultra successful pre WB business life included, an entertaining description of his flits around Africa, some glimpses into US policy towards the WB and IMF and not much else. I would have preferred a book focusing more on the sub title's topics and not on the charismatic \\"warrior king\\" who briefly breathed some life into one of the world's top posts. The book is neither fish nor fowl, neither a glossy bio of Wolfenshn, nor a good critique of the issues implicit in the sub title. A good read but not an insightful one.	2005-10-09

Interestingly, the word Iraq comes from the name of the Sumerian city state Uruk. There is now a village called Warka near the ruins of the ancient city.<br /><br />The introductory chapters explore the geographical setting, archaeological research and the paleo-, meso- and neolithic periods. Following on, the author discusses the Hassuna, Samarra, Halat, Ubaid, Uruk and Jemdat timeframes, and the ancient trade routes.<br /><br />Next up is the Sumerian civilization, with a study of its origin, religion, history and mythology. The story of Gilgamesh is covered here. There was a Semitic interlude and a final Sumerian renaissance before the torch of history passed to the Semites in the form of the Akkadians and later the Assyrians and Babylonians. The statesman and lawgiver Hammurabbi is thoroughly dealt with.<br /><br />But other peoples played a part too, like the Hurrians, Mitannians and Kassites. Insofar as they impacted upon the history of the area, empires like the Hittite and the Egyptian are also considered. There are detailed narratives on the Assyrian empire, the Chaldean kings and the fall of Nineveh and later of Babylon. After this event, Mesopotamia ceased to be a seat of empire and passed from the Persians to the Greeks, the Parthians, the Sassanids and ultimately to the Arabs.<br /><br />In the Epilogue, we learn of the heritage of this civilization, such as enduring religious symbols like the Maltese cross, the tree of life an the crescent. Some words have come down to us, like \\"alcohol\\" (guhlu in Akkadian), \\"myrrh\\" (murru) and \\"naphta\\" (naptu), \\"abyss\\" (abzu in Sumerian). Some Sumerian words still live in Hebrew, like Egal (great house) = Heikal = Temple and the personal name Eitan (Etana).<br /><br />The book contains plates with photographs and illustrations, and concludes with bibliographic notes, comparative history tables, various interesting maps and indices of names and subjects. For those interested in the paleolithic origins of civilization, I recommend Lost Civilizations Of The Stone Age by Richard Rudgley. If you have a taste for alternative history, the book Ramses II And His Time by Immanuel Velikovsky has much to say about Babylon and the Chaldeans.

In this first book of the series Sabrina and Daphne must overcome many obstacles as they learn what it means to be Grimm.<br /><br />Michael Buckley's first book is a thrilling, and sometimes chilling, new look at fairy tale characters we thought we knew.  Many preconceived notions as to who is good and who is bad in the land of faerie, or in this case Ferryport Landing, will be challenged.  This story invites the reader to indulge in a bit of detective work along with, and at times beyond, the girls themselves.  The mix of fairy tale and family drama is surprisingly good, and the ending leaves the reader with the prospect of a new adventure to look forward to.  Keep your copy of the original Brothers Grimm tales close at hand; this story may leave you wanting to investigate a bit more.	2005-10-09

This is obvious in reading the collection of essays which focus more on Institutional Economics (a branch of sociology), rhetoric, and anthropology. Most of the contributors buzz around the issue of the (patriarchal) family and use Gary Becker, another (very undeserving) Nobel prize winner as their whipping boy. But Becker's work on the economics of sleep and such like is also tangential.<br /><br />This slim tome strikes me as an exercise in academic vanity publishing. The inclusion of Donald McCloskey, who got a sex change operation since it was published, reinforces that. Economics has a myriad of failings and short comings but having it colonized by even softer and shallower social \\"sciences\\" is not the answer. The contributors devote some space to explaining that their type of work is regard as sciences in most languages, English being the big exception. That seems to be where they are at: kitchen arguments, ignoring facts and solid axioms in favor of doctrine.	2005-10-09

Marisa D'Vari has woven a powerful and dynamic \\"magic\\" into the More-Personality system she developed that will help writers enhance their work by truly speaking through the characters they create.  Marisa's years of professional experience and expertise is evident in this new work. She walks writers through the blockages that keep many from being productive.  She details and outlines the complexities of personality that need to be addressed in order to bring a mediocre piece of writing to higher standard. The \\"it\\" of good material starts with the writer, but  is spoken through the characters that are created. In order for a work to be deemed credible, it has to be believable.  Skilled writers know how to match dialogue to character.  They know how to speak the story through the words of those complex personalities that have been brought together to carry the tale.  These characters have to be purposeful and they have to speak to the theme and live through the plot.  I can't think of any other writer on these topics who brings a \\"process\\" to the table that can work for the skilled successful writer as well as the novice who is still in training.  This is a \\"must have\\" book.  Marisa has done it again! <br />Lloyd Sheldon Johnson	2005-10-09

In the opening the prisoner, Lenoir, is to be executed the following day.  He is young, no more than 22.  The condemned man refuses to speak in a meaningful way to the law enforcement officials to save himself.  In the end no one keeps Lenoir company.      Maigret goes to Morsang to an inn on the Seine while his wife is in the country.  There is sailing.  One of the guests, Marcel Basso, has a gun, and Monsieur Feinstein is shot dead.  Madame Feinstein, Mado, is taken indoors.  Maigret hates Paris when his wife is there.  He learns that Mado and Basso had a friendship.  Basso is missing.      After the commission of the crime, Maigret does not feel he is a welcome presence to the weekenders.  The establishment at the river is called Guinguette a Deux Sous.  When someone shows up from  a municipal sanitorium Maigret mentions the name of Lenoir.  Obviously the new man is someone who is going to live on his lung trouble.      The book is notable for its atmosphere and the pace of the storytelling.	2005-10-09

The 'Foreword' notes that the discussion about the future funds does not address the more important topic of productive capacity of the economy in 50 or 75 years (p.xv). Most politicians and economists have a poor record in forecasting future events (p.xvi). There are a number of reasonable options available. The word \\"entitlement\\" is used for prejudice against Social Security, which is earned and not granted. The 'Preface' explains the major parts of this book and its 247 pages of text, 64 pages of notes, bibliography, and index. One flaw in this book is the lack of a short summary aimed towards a general audience. It prevents its message from being widely received. <br /> <br />Chapter 1 tells of the propaganda campaign about the need to save Social Security, as if there is some horrible event that will occur in 30 or more years. The biggest expenses for government are education and Social Security, but only the latter has a dedicated source of financing. Some proposed solutions to \\"save\\" Social Security and Medicare are designed to destroy them (p.5) These schemes use ignorance and fear to sway opinions (p.8). The author points out the ignorance about the proposed changes to Social Security (p.9). Projections about the future depend on assumptions, which are based on what a person would like to see (p.11). The author suggests modest changes are all that is needed at this time. Future generations will solve future problems. The \\"irresponsibility\\" is to make changes when you don't know what will happen and do unnecessary damage (p.12). Cutting Social Security and Medicare may be good for the budget, but the government exists to benefit the people, not the budget (p.13). <br /> <br />The advantage of social insurance is explained (p.20). The length of life and need for retirement income is variable. You would need to save the maximum for a worst case situation. But if the money is pooled then people would be protected as a lower cost. The plan for social insurance was a reaction against the Townsend Plan which would pay for pensions out of general revenue. Doing nothing was not an option. Benefits are earned, not given, or won in gambling in the market (p.22). Page 23 explains the redistribution of benefits. Having a pay-as-you-go system also keeps payroll taxes lower (p.24). The cost of living adjustment started in 1972 [after Nixon devalued the dollar in 1971]. Another question is when to finance benefits from general revenues (p.25). [Should capital gains and dividends be taxed?] <br /> <br />Medicaid is given and means-tested; it is not earned. It has both state and federal features, and is less reliable since it varies as t changing income (pp. 34-35). The author points out that people pay taxes for public education even when they receive no benefits (p.36). [Yet people correctly complain against the excessive costs of public education that is paid by regressive taxes.] <br /> <br />Social Security and Medicare allow the retired to live with dignity and security in their old age without becoming a burden on others. The debate over Social Security is not about affordability\\" but of politics: what should be done (p.38).There is a hidden agenda to the attacks on Social Security, one that proponents dare not mention to the public because it is anti-human or anti-people. <br />	2005-10-09

I find this book really helpful and insightful regarding all the aspects of singing, breathing, producing sound in general, etc. It not only helps with singing, but it for instance also helps you learn better breathing habits.

I find it hard to imagine that any other book will provide more insight.<br /><br />For people who need to do without a teacher I'd most certainly recommend this book. You might want to search for CD's or DVD's as an extra learning aid too, to help you visualise/audiolise things if you find this hard to do. An instrument might be nice. You probably need something to produce the desired notes so you can sing along with them. This will be a great help when doing the suggested exercises.

The following review was written for a class in Botanical Medicine as part of a degree program in Naturopathic Medicine.  <br /> <br /> Buhner's book can be divided into two distinct parts.  In the first half of the book, Buhner explores the ideas of linear versus nonlinear thought.  He explains that nature is a culmination of fractal patterns and fluctuations, and extrapolates this idea into the concept of the human thought process.  According to Buhner, the brain thinks linearly, defined by logic, language and life experience, but the heart has its own vibrational consciousness.  When the heart is used as an organ of perception, the entire body is healthier and more in tune with its natural surroundings.  I related to the story about the author's exposure to nature after living in the suburbs, which immediately brought up memories of my own childhood and similar feelings about being in natural versus manmade surroundings.   <br /> The second half of the book is devoted to applying the concept of heart consciousness to communication with plants and with people.  He explains how native peoples around the world have learned over time to use plants for medicine, ritual and food - when asked, they always say they learned from the plants themselves.  In this section I found some very powerful, unique concepts about plants.  One was the idea that a person's deep-seated need will be communicated through their energy, expressed via the heart consciousness, and that plants respond to this on various levels.  They not only begin to produce medicinal chemicals in response to the need, but they respond and tell the person how to use them.  Buhner explores methods of communicating with plants and shows how to bring about an open dialogue for learning from the plant itself.  He then goes on to show that this heart communication with the plant can also be used in the same way to communicate as a healer with people, their disease, and their organs.   This type of communication involves a spiritual link with the person seeking healing and involves much introspection and time on the healer's part.  He teaches how to use all of your senses to perceive information about a patient on many different levels and how to integrate this information into a complete picture, finally feeling for the right plant to heal that person. <br /> In Buhner's paradigm, to be a healer you must be completely honest and in touch with yourself and your heart in order to be able to communicate with other sentient beings.  He concludes the book by exploring how to access this heart consciousness through introspection.  Part of this is undoing the damage of socialization and education so that we come closer to our primitive state and feel with our hearts - until we think with our hearts and there is no difference between thinking and feeling.  Thus linear thinking is abolished and the individual is in true communion with all living beings. Buhner ends with a series of exercises for \\"refining the heart as an organ of perception.\\" <br /> Reading this book has been a defining moment in my education, not only as a Naturopath, but as a spiritual being.   Although parts of the book were somewhat tedious and not well written, the ideas expressed therein spoke to me on a deep level.  I have always felt drawn to plants and natural environments, and have had a communicative, interactive experience with the few plants I have been fortunate enough to cultivate and learn about.  Being in a medical school and focusing on linear, scientific methodology has sometimes taken me away from the path of spirit that I feel more comfortable with   Buhner's book helped refresh in my conscious mind what I have always known to be true - I must think and feel with my heart in order to be true to myself and those around me.	2005-10-09

Basic construction, finishing, and even decorating ideas are included. <br /> <br />The center section is \\"tear-out\\" full-sized plans, printed on only one side of the paper. Fortunately, I always photocopied (and now scan and print). Finally came the project-by-project instructions with copious drawings of what went where. <br /> <br />Where the outside covers were not sufficient to show color pictures of all the projects (as in v.III), inner color pages were added. <br /> <br />I have the first three volumes. Perhaps some later reviewer can let us know of more. The pattern pages, on matte stock, are ivory with age, but not yellowed or browned. The rest is still glossy and white--good paper! <br /> <br />If I have any quibbles, they mostly come from the age of the books: I use Tyvek bits off envelopes instead of paper for the hinges, and have had to find my own brands of acrylic finishes. The author does assume you will use balsa wood, like a number of others. I have never had a good result in my crafting life using balsa: I always use basswood, which doesn't split as easily and doesn't crumble on the endgrain like balsa does. It works even better. Getting into the craft hardwoods now available has never seemed necessary to me, though I'm now contemplating it if only to refresh the hobby. <br /> <br />Now, would Craft Publications, Inc. kindly re-issue these and make themselves some money? I would cheerfully pay the cost of a six-pack or two of ordinary beer (the international standard of cost) for any missing volumes. The furniture is so well designed, the patterns so carefully drafted, and the instructions so clear that they are quite worth that price.	2005-10-09

There are accounts the Vinland Sagas, 13th-century chronicles that relate Leif Erikson's discovery of Vinland.  <br /> <br />He only discovered them from the viewpoint of the Europeans. Yet his first voyage did prove one thing for sure, that the earth was not only round, but that it was bigger than he had thought, Eratosthenes notwithstanding. In Washington state, the 9,000-year-old Kennewick Man was a rare find. Only a handful of skeletons this old had ever been found in North America.  <br /> <br />One of the first known celebrations marking the discovery of the \\"New World\\" by Christopher Columbus was in 1792, when a ceremony organized by the Colombian Order was held in New York City honoring Columbus and the 300th anniversary of his landing in the Bahamas.  The Bahamas, a group of 700 islands, dot the Atlantic Ocean from Florida almost to Haiti. Only 30 of the islands are inhabited. When Christopher Columbus first set foot in the New World on San Salvador in 1492, the Arawak Indians were the only inhabitants there. <br /> <br />On October 12, 1866 the Italian population of New York organized the first celebration of the discovery of America. Three years later, in 1869 Italians in San Francisco celebrated October 12 calling it C-Day. How did Christopher Columbus find his way to the \\"New World\\"? He used maps, of course. There was just one problem. His maps were wrong!  <br /> <br />The year is 1492. In three frail boats, Christopher Columbus heads west across the Atlantic Ocean.  Half a world away, on the South China Sea, another ship embarked on a very different kind of journey. In its hold lay the riches of the Far East: intricately embroidered silks and the finest vessels of delicately painted porcelain. These were the treasures that Columbus could only dream of and only China could create.  <br /> <br />Between the 13th and the 16th century, China was the greatest industrial power. Not only in Asia, but I would think in the world. The quality of what China was producing during that period was simply staggering to the vast majority of the consumers in the known world at the time. <br /> <br />On August 2, 1492, Columbus set sail in search of the East Indies. The voyage was financed by Ferdinand and Isabella by making the city of Palos pay back a debt to the crown by providing two of the ships, and by getting Italian financial backing for part of the expenses. The crown had to put up very little money from the treasury.   <br /> <br />Columbus and 90 crewmen boarded the three ships that were to make the first voyage to the New World, the Nia, Pinta, and the flagship, Santa Maria. On October 12, 1492, Columbus first saw the islands of the new world, landing in the Bahamas. Later in the month, he would sail to Cuba, and to Hispaniola (now Haiti). He thought he had reached the East Indies, the islands off Southeast Asia.  <br /> <br />All educated individuals in the 15th century, and especially sailors, already knew that the earth was round. What was not realized by Columbus, however, was just how big a globe it was. Columbus seriously underestimated the size of the planet.  <br /> <br />On Christmas Day, 1492, the Santa Maria sank off Haiti.  Columbus departed for Spain on January 16, 1493 on the Nia, arriving there on March 4.  Columbus made three additional voyages to the New World. The second voyage set sail in September, 1493, with 17 ships. During his expeditions, he helped to colonize Hispaniola, and discovered the South American mainland.  <br /> <br />He did not, however, see mainland North America during any of his voyages.  He returned to Spain for the last time on November 7, 1504. He died at Valladolid, Spain on May 20, 1506, at the age of 55.   <br /> <br />Much controversy exists over Columbus' expeditions and whether or not one can \\"discover\\" an already-inhabited land. The natives of the Bahamas and other islands on his journey were peaceful and friendly. Yet many of them were later enslaved by the Spanish. Also, it is known that the Vikings explored the North American coast 500 years before Columbus. <br /> <br />To mark the 400th anniversary of Columbus' voyage, in 1892, President Benjamin Harrison made a commemorative proclamation. But it was Colorado, in 1905, that became the first state to observe a Columbus Day. Since 1920 the day has been celebrated annually, and in 1937 President Franklin Roosevelt proclaimed every October 12 as Columbus Day. That's where it remained until 1971 when Congress declared it a federal public holiday on the second Monday in October.	2005-10-09

Unfortunately, the examples used in the book are 'corny' and distract from the important concepts leading to unneeded text and dreadful thoughts of 'The clip joint' and 'the solar powered cookie oven'. The grammar used in this book is a bit strange; don't, won't, etc appear frequently. This is somewhat odd as bernake was a former Fed governor and abel is also distinguised. I think that, perhaps, the authors attempted to 'dumb down' the book and in the process managed to merely make it corny. I also am a bit appalled at the amount of space given to math - it seems the authors wanted it to be more 'accessible'. <br /> <br />I will agree that the 'real world' examples are both pertinent and informative. They were chosen very well. The footnotes are also welcome as the authors frequently simplify models. <br /> <br />This book could use some trimming and perhaps less talk about dog groomers and the like. If that were to happen this would be one of the best macro books out there.  <br /> <br />Anyone want to bet on Dr B becoming Fed Chair?

Despite this easy reading, Dave Pelzer has some remarkable stories that involve various emotions; one minute he's happy and the next he's sad and crying. This story starts off when Dave is nine years old and living in Daly City, California.   <br />  <br />Dave is held captive in the dark, cold garage of his home and is only allowed to partake in something if his mother gives him the okay. He is not even allowed to breathe without her permission, no joke! After a night full of anticipation, Dave was finally called by his abusive mother and father to come upstairs. He raced up the stairs; his mother stood at the top of the landing with her hands on her hips, and yelled \\"Get out of my house! I don't like you! I don't want you! I never loved you! Get the h**l out of my house\\" (p.9)! <br />  <br />In my opinion this is an inspiring and crucial novel. Everyone should read this book to see just how valuable their lives really are. When you read this book, you begin to think about all the magnificent things you have had while growing up compared to what Dave Pelzer had as a child. Dave went through life trying to find a place to fit in. For awhile, he was emotionally unstable because of all the torment that he had gone through previously. Luckily, all this pain did not overcome Dave. Dave saw it as another challenge, a challenge that he needed to overcome.    <br />  <br />In the long run, we realize that this novel is filled with inspiration, sorrow, endurance and most importantly love!  <br />	2005-10-09

I bought this book about a year ago this November.  It is a really good backdrop to the movie.  Almost like a \\"behind the scenes\\" look at all the actors and actresses that took part in the making of a really great classic that will go down in history among the greats.  I think that the only thing I am not too much in favor with is the re-attaching of James Dean as a kind of \\"manic\\" man with all kinds of sex tendencies.  I just don't think that any personal life of an actor be definitively defined.  No one seems to define or wish to Natalie Wood's affair with a 43 year old Director?  Why?  Wouldn't that be considered a statutory crime today?      I personally don't know what would have become of James Dean's Career other that I believe he would be successful and hope he would not become the \\"Elvis\\" of Hollywood as we all know how that turned out for \\"The King\\".  James Dean was an introvert while Nat Wood was not.  But his Life is only beginning now...in eternity.

The character development was a little weak.  Miles went from being shallow to thoughtful off and on throughout the story.  The personalities of the town criminals such as Otis and his brother were a little thin.  I never really got a good feel for Sara's character.  The first third of the novel is sheer romance while the second two-thirds pretty much drops all the passion and tries to move toward a conclusion to a bland attempt at a psychological thriller.  The storyline does become more interesting toward the end.  This book is a good read if you have a couple hours to kill in an airport.	2005-10-09

Walker's book fills in a significant gap in the forces involved in that theater by providing a military analysis of the Italian forces without falling back on the clichs that grew from the conflict.  He does not, and cannot, argue that the Italian army in WWII was great; he does put the army in its appropriate strategic and political context. In fact the first few chapters of the book provide a contextual analysis for the army in North Africa so that you can understand why the Italians did poorly, but at the same time know why they did well given their constraints -- something often overlooked in a theater where Rommel, Montgomery, and Patton made their names and became larger than life.     One thing to keep in mind is that the focus of the book is on the three Italian armored divisions that fought in North Africa -- Ariete, Littorio, and Centauro.  This is not bad given that this was a theater that required mobility to fight and survive.  Following the contextual analysis the balance of the book is a straight forward military history that describes and analyzes the performance of these divisions first as Italy fought alone against Britain, then as Italy fought with their German allies against Britain and then the Americans in Tunisia.	2005-10-09

Numbers and statistics put clients to sleep. But describing a financial concept by telling a story engages the client(s). I am a Financial Advisor, and when people ask me what I do as a Financial Advisor, I tell them a story. Sometimes I go with this (this is not in the book): \\"The average American spends a dollar the following way: They spend $0.62 on standard of living, $0.25 on taxes, $0.10 on insurance, and $0.03 or less on savings. I find ways to reduce your tax liability, try to reduce your insurance while maintaining proper and adequate coverage, and see if we can cut some spending on standard of living.\\" You would be surprised to see how clients listen to that versus a complex explanation of what a Financial Advisor does - because they can relate to a dollar and how it is spent. If you want to keep trying to imprees clients with how smart you are by using industry jargon, statistics, and other numbers - keep doing it; it may be one more client for me to hook.

Maybe I started in the wrong place.  I am really disgusted by novels and television shows that seek to get inside the mind and motivation of a sick psycho killer.  The crimes get grosser and scarier and the victims dumb and dumber.  I would much rather spend more time with the victims and their reacclimation to family and friends than the comings and goings of the Wolf.  And it really irked me that he was not caught in the end.   <br /> <br />Much more interesting was Alex's view of the FBI and his feelings about the transition from the police department to the FBI.  Patterson could have done more to explore the strenghts and weaknesses of both groups and the tensions present when trying to work together.  That familiar \\"trust no one\\" was not sufficiently explored and the bad \\"good\\" guys just seemed to be recycled.   <br /> <br />I was very confused by the Alex Cross family man and lover scenario.  He did not seem to be particularly good at either and his children unusually forgiving.  I can only assume this situation was developed in an earlier book and is presented in this one as a given.  What were quickly described as part-time tasks are full-time jobs in my house.  Even a smart and savvy grandmother has trouble keeping up with teenagers and their busy school schedules, not to mention their social lives.  Cross appears only marginally involved with his family, and then only with the good parts.  An example is his relationship with a woman who lives 3,000 miles away.  Who couldn't maintain a relationship that only requires a half hour a day?  And that by phone.  It is the daily routine with my husband that causes friction. <br /> <br />I am reading the next Alex Cross book just to put an end, I hope, to the Wolf.  But after that I am leaving Patterson and too cool Cross behind.  He needs to develop a soul before I find him more interesting than the criminals he istracking.	2005-10-09

I've never left a review before, but I really felt I should this time.<br /><br />This book was such an utter disappointment; if I could give it zero stars, I would.  I followed up on this author a little and it appears her background is in fanfiction and I now suspect that the previous reviews were done by her fanfic followers.  Be wary before you choose this book.<br /><br />Characterization is a huge catalyst for a story.  A character who interests you, who you care about, will pull you into a book, keep you invested and even forgive a few technical writing errors.  It took me a long time to finish this book because I've never read a more annoying main character.  Sunnie (the uber-repressed, yet with an irrepressible smile) is supposed to be male.  You wouldn't know it if the author didn't tell us.  The argument might be that he's been abused and, therefore, fearful, but even with that background you still want to read about a character who, in spite of those abuses, is interesting and finding his bravery.  There is nothing interesting or brave about a man--even a gay man--who covers his face in embarrassment at the sight of women's breasts--covered breasts, no less.<br /><br />I wish I could say something positive, but there's nothing to say.  As far as the writing itself goes, it's at times clunky and confusing.  Some descriptions had me laughing out loud and I'm quite certain that's not what the author intended at that moment.<br /><br />I'm always looking for quality gay fiction and this wasn't it.  Unless you like your main characters as dynamic as a wet rag (and your dialogue as absurd as a President Bush speech), then don't waste your energy on this book.	2005-10-09

This strongly reflects the character of the American people, as well as the nation itself. <br /> <br />But the strength of Look Homeward Angel is in the prose.  Wolfe's writing brings to light those passing moments in time that stay with us forever but which we don't recognize at the time as significant - the glory of the air in an early spring morning, the sensual stimuli that are all around us walking down a dark street late at night, and many other unforgetable scenes.  His writing has the power and vitality of Faulkner, without the sometimes impossible sentences that cause one to lose track.  It is challenging and rich.  Look Homeward, Angel is a masterpiece of place, time, and style.	2005-10-09

While the book has its moments, everything about it sounds so highly improbable that I was not put into a state of willing suspension of disbelief (like I was with Shopaholic) - so the book started to really drag for me barely a quarter into the story.

The basic story is interesting but the subtext is more so. If magic is so powerful why did it die out in the world? Is there more to it and is the power of magic always good or even usually good? These questions are suitably, for a novel, addressed within the confines of the story and there is no resort to parenthetical preaching by the author. <br />  Of course \\"magic\\" may be viewed as a placeholder for any type of power wielded by a few over the lives of the many- especially something like science. This analogy is nearly made evident in the plot line by the upswell of journals devoted to magic after the two magicians become well known; by the scholarly manner in which Mr. Norrell goes about learning and applying magic and by the author's use of footnotes.  <br />   There is no final answer to the moral question of good vs. evil inherent in magic (or science) but the types of issues that any one person might use to make their own decision are examined (we are guided by the earnest enthusiasm, conventional morality and good intentions of Jonthan Strange which are woefully inadequate to address such questions as:is it right to directly kill other men in war, in a fashion against which they have no defense, to support your own side; is providing your side an advantage in war that results in the death of many of the other side moral; would raising the dead be morally acceptable?) Clearly these are the types of questions that were raised in the use of the atomic bomb in WWII and in cloning and other cutting edge science.  <br />   Interestingly, the end of the book might be a reprise of the beginning (and this is left a little indefinite) with a group of feckless magicians manque sitting around talking about magic but not doing any.Has it died out again? Have Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell decided it best to withdraw from the world and take magic with them (certainly they come to realize that the moral issues raised transcend their power to answer.) Have ordinary men decided that, in fact, ignorance is preferable to knowledge since the risk exceeds the perceived benefit?  <br />   A reader can enjoy the story alone but the temptation to look under the surface at the author's purpose is nearly irresistible and if one does the entire story is a more work than one might expect from a novel. This can result in reader fatigue in a book this long.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

When I first read \\"Vault of the Ages\\" it was an exciting  book; in reviewing it as an adult  close to 40 years later as an adult I find it still an enjoyable read. Looking back on the stories I read in my youth this had to be the first in the  series of this genre of post doomsday chronicles that I continued to enjoy...    This book  emphasizes messages about human responsibility and the importance of using science only for good almost as though accentuated with a bright yellow Hi-Lighter Pen.    The story is set in the Alleghenies roughly 500 years after a nuclear holocaust, Vault of the Ages tells the story peaceful farming tribes vs.  fierce warriors. Carl, our lead hero and son of the village Chief is responsible for trading with  the people from the ruined city to obtain metal and other needed materials form  the  remains of skyscrapers etc...      Carl and his companions discover a \\"time vault,\\" basically a large time capsule  remaining from the pre-holocaust civilization, containing numerous tools, books, models of apparatus and more depicting the  sciences that have since been lost. With the aid of   the newly discovered sciences and much common sense he is able to help his people.    In rereading the description of the 'VAULT' it brings a smile to my face when I look around our office, library and museum facilities here at the  Southwest Museum of Engineering, Communications and Computation here in Glendale Arizona.... I can imagine a facility such as this  being the 'VAULT' spoken of in this story. I wonder what the world will be like in 500 years and what part the material preserved by the museum here will play in it....    Ed Sharpe, Archivist for SMECC   [...]	2005-10-09

Actually Mike still owes me and many other Christians an apology for all of the lies he told and which I formerly believed. He's never given one.  Almost all of what he said in his previous book, and during many speaking engagements, was thoroughly debunked by Cornerstone Magazine who interviewed all of the people who knew him, including his girlfriend during the time he was a satanic priest and had \\"long blonde hair\\" \\"six inch fingernails\\" was shot by a pimp, had an extravagant apartment paid for by an international satanic organization, had sex slaves he kept in his apartment, yadda, yadda, yadda. Times and locations given conflict and never add up.  None of it was true.  His friends did say he read books on satanism and was an excellent storyteller.  There is a lot more he has said that was a total fabrication, there just isn't enough room here. Mike has never apologized, as even Jim Bakker did (his book was titled \\"I was wrong).  He has never responded to the investigation which debunked his whole \\"life story.\\" Mike did say he \\"exaggerated\\" a bit... How about \\"completely fabricated\\" might be a better phrase... Mike has never turned in any of the people he claims were committing \\"human sacrifices,\\" kidnappings, or any of the other horrible felonies and atrocities Mike says he took part in.  Now he's whining about how nobody wants anything to do with him after it was all exposed.  What do you expect, Mike?  His ministry for \\"helping victims of satanic ritual abuse\\" reportedly was a sham.  There are no law enforcement records for any missing persons or bodies found.  No law enforcement records corroborate any of what he's said. Now the IRS has revoked his tax-exempt status because of him and his wife and friend taking over $800,000 in salaries each, and buying other expensive items, while sending out letters saying his ministry was in financial trouble and pleading for more money.  Friendly fire??? Yes, because your accusers were necessarily your enemies.  Mike has never repented, he submitted himself to a board made up of his own cronies who told him not to \\"answer his critics.\\" How convenient, Mike... These were not critics, these were respected people of the church who were asking for an explanation, and whose congregations were taken in by Mike Warnke.

As I also have the French English Bilingual Visual Dictionary published by the same company, I can say with some regret that the format and the pictures are identical in both books.  In the Food section, for example, there is no section that introduces specifically Italian cheeses, concentrates on depicting Italian desserts or gives some rudimentary introduction to the Italian  amero or digestivo.  I would have liked to see specific Italian brand names depicted so that when I do go to the market or the coffee bar in Italy, I would already have an idea of what the packaging or product looks like as well as the correct word because I was using the book as a primer prior to my venture.

US	50893257	R20VQ9DDKP15LU	0787965545	79693949	Living the Questions: Essays Inspired by the Work and Life of Parker J. Palmer	Books	5	14	14	N	N	A Life Undivided	Since the initial publication of To Know as We are Known (1983/1993), Parker Palmer has been inviting us to explore our own inner landscapes and to envision our lives in their entirety as a \\"Hidden Wholeness\\" and not as divided parts.  This invitation is an invitation to a journey; but Palmer does not invite us to the journey from the position of mentor or even of guide, but rather as a fellow traveler.  In this book, Dr. Sam Intrator has done an amazing job of both chronicling the nature of journey Palmer invites us to share, and of exploring, through the essays of various other travelers, the impact this journey has had on the world.  <br /> <br />     The book starts with a short, well-crafted and engaging overview of the life and works of Parker J. Palmer.  The book then moves into six sections, each composed of a series of individual essays, about the impact Palmer's words, deeds and example have had on ideas, programs and people. Each essay is carefully crafted and chosen to put in the center of our attention, not Palmer himself, but the ideas and personal experiences that Palmer has opened up for each essay author.  The essays deal with issues of learning, teaching and leadership in the context of core identity and integrity as they manifest individually in each of us.  The clear thread holding the book together, that Intrator skillfully brings out, is the quest of a less-divided, more authentic way of being as learners, teachers, leaders and human beings. Contributing essayists include well-known writers and thinkers such as Margaret Wheatley, Chip Wood, Jane Tompkins, Michael Lerner, Russ Moxley, Sharon Daloz Parks and Peter Senge.  For anyone interested in the dynamic of identity and integrity - of soul and role - of who we are and what we do - this book will prove a joyful and illuminating experience.  <br /> <br />     In one particularly striking essay, Jay Casbon cites Thomas Merton in saying, \\"The humble person receives praise the way a clean window takes the light of the sun.  The truer and more intense the light is, the less you see of the glass\\".  This is a pure and graceful metaphor for this book.  Intrator has provided us with a window into ourselves, through the work of Parker Palmer, with a glass so clean and bright that the light dazzles the spirit.  <br /> <br />- Dr. Mike Poutiatine <br />	2005-10-09

It was supposed to be the first of a series of books on the subject but the author died before any of the later books were written.  It is already a standard resource for other authors.    This book is not a dry recounting of facts.  It is an easy read and all of my family who have borrowed the book from me have said as much.  I took three courses in History from Professor Isenberg when I was a midshipman at the Naval Academy and his writing style is very much HIS personal conversational style.  Not many other history texts use the phrase \\"bass-ackwards\\" to describe a situation.     The treatment of the Cuban Missile Crisis from the Navy's perspective is the book's most important feature and takes up nearly 100 pages.  The personalities involved and how their clashes influenced decision-making over time is particularly instructive. I had never before considered that the Missile Crisis was the result of JFK's failure to win the Bay of Pigs operation because it allowed the Soviets to think they could push him around.  Nor have I read that many of our military leaders thought America actually LOST the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Very interesting stuff and well documented.  In fact, the book is fully footnoted but only with references.  The narrative is complete so there is no need to look up the footnotes for amplifying information unless you want to see the sources.    This book was written 30 years after the end of the time frame it covers and time allows more of the \\"Fog of History\\" to clear.  While I regret the early death of Professor Isenberg, I suspect that his second volume in this series detailing the Navy during the latter half of the Cold War would have been premature.      This is a thoroughly enjoyable book.	2005-10-09

I am presenting \\"Mustang Sallies\\" to my reading group next month and I feel confident thirteen other women are going to find strength in Fawn's writings.   <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to any and all career women who have felt undervalued and conflicted about their careers.	2005-10-09

Each main cast member has 1 month dedicated to a solo shot (Chad, Sophia, James, Hilarie & Bethany) with the rest as combo shot of Sophia/Chad/Hil ; Soph/Hil ; Bethany/James ; Chad/Sophia & Hil/Soph/Chad and the final month is the full cast shot. The other 4 month to a page, to add up to the 16-months they boast of is left to Chad, the main reason why people would buy this I guess. <br /> <br />Everybody has seen the photo shoots the pics come from, but they did pick different poses of the photo shoots, so I guess that's a bonus for the diehard fans. <br /> <br />Nothing special to really distinguish the calendar from the rest of the pack. No quotes, or themes to tie in the calendar part to the show. But the holidays they included are far & wide to get the global audience ie: Australia Day! <br /> <br />Bonus: a small poster (of the cover shot) is included as a bonus inside the calendar for your wall.	2005-10-09

ISBN 0307020398 - First, since the book description is missing (as of the moment I'm writing) - Winnie the Pooh visits Rabbit for lunch, eating so much he is unable to get out the door. While stuck there, he meets Gopher, who proposes to dig Pooh out - for a price.<br /><br />My review: Family fave Winnie the Pooh lives under the name Sanders, the story begins. Winnie Sanders? No, it's a just a name over his door. Pooh and his friends are always great and this book is no exception. Author DeSantis does a nice job with Milne's creations and the Disney illustrations are wonderful.

US	52672557	R6OFZPNVOXYQS	1555661173	544548386	The Athletic Skier	Books	3	5	7	N	Y	Careful	As a PSIA Ski Instructor I would recommend folks be very careful about some of the canting information in this book. The book assumes that all bowlegged skiers are overcanted and while this is mostly true it is not absolutely true.  Many bowlegged skiers (including myself) are naturally undercanted and the advice presented in this book is incorrect for us.  This book seems to be the source for the 'if you are bowlegged, cant on the outside of the ski' common wisdom, and again that is simply not true in all cases.  Canting solutions are individual and must not be over generalized.  Instead, read the descriptions of what effects over or under canting can have and see which fits you.  Then cant as necessary. <br /> <br />Also, I would say that this 'used to be' the definitive guide.  After reading both this and All Mountain Skier by Mark Elling, I would definately recommend the latter.  Ellings book is much more useful for actual practice.  There is not much in here that is not better covered in Ellings book.  Also, the technical information in Ellings book (on canting for example) is much more accurate. <br /> <br />	2005-10-09

The book is a sensation in the literary world and is a best seller. While the truth of the the matter is, the book is simply boring . <br /> <br />You have to commend the author for a clear depiction of the life in Iran during the Iran - Iraq war and Khomeni era. The fear over the bombing and the phone calls that they make among relatives How universities ended up the breeding grounds for non educational activities , Actions of Khomeni and their approach to keep Iranians upbeat on a losing war etc are well written..With lots of respect to the author, I disagree with the book's entertainment value  and information value for the following reasons <br /> <br /> <br />1. In almost every other page, there is a lengthy description of one person or another ( ex : Next to Manna is Mahshid, whose long black scarf clashes with her delicate features and retreating smile...... <br />2. If it is not describing about Some person, it is a discussion of every literature that i have little to no knowledge of ( just like most of the readers). to enjoy this book, you should have to have read Lolita, Gatsby and tons of othe books <br /> <br />If you are like me, dont bother reading the book. Understand that there was an era in iran where people were oppressed a lot , there was lots of unneccessary executions, scarf became mandatory etc... Watch some senate hearings on CSPAN. I bet it is going to be more entertaining! <br />	2005-10-09

The public clamour for the return of this book has been quite exceptional and only serves to illustrate the power of word of mouth.  Books seldom continue to build an audience once they are out of print but this work has continued to attract attention, with people fiercely outbidding one another on ebay, stealing it from libraries and signing an internet petition demanding a reprint.  An exceptional response to a truely exceptional and award winning book.

I can't imagine reading this book in translation (but if English is not your first language, I'm sure the translations still stay true to form).

I'd agree, and add that it left me panting, excited to read Mr. Elbom's second book. This is a fun, accessible book for anyone who wants a glimpse into many minds crazier than their own.

The story line really appeals to children with a sense of humour (my five year old will love it!)  The theme of where's my Daddy is familiar to them from a few books so the alterations and the 'citifying' of it just makes it more fun than the bland versions they have had until now. <br />The illustrations are superb!  So what if the characters don't fit the mould you imagined them to be, does every film character look as you imagined from the book?

Ehrenreich's fellow job seekers are painted as bland walls who are desperate for a career. We know very little about how they get by, which makes this book difficult to identify with even for similarly unemployed white collar people. <br /> <br />The biggest problem with this book is that Ehrenreich set herself up to fail. Rare is the middle-age job seeker who is willing to work anywhere; even more rare is the employer who is willing to look all over the country for a worker when they can find one in their backyard. I don't necessarily think employers have a preference, but they certainly don't want to pay travel expenses if they don't have to. <br /> <br />Much of the book was a mystery to me; I had no idea that image consultants and religious job groups existed. For what she wrote, she wrote it well. I just can't believe she missed writing about the items above. Still, a good read for fans and the unemployed alike.	2005-10-09

Now that I've read \\"Dry\\" I think I know what it is.  A gift for storytelling. It's easy to miss that in a memoir.  Granted, Burroughs has had a fascinating (in a train-wreck sort of way)life to work with, but not everyone can repeat the fascinating and still make it entertaining.  He certainly can! And given his somewhat acerbic style, I never expected to actually cry during the telling of his friend Pighead's dying. And yet I did, and was deeply moved. Although I couldn't tell you exactly why, which may be the real genius of Burroughs'writing...it's indefinable.

Alicia Erian deftly explores the maturing of a young Lebanese-American girl.  Erian takes a no-holds-barred approach to telling Jasira's story, and for that her book has been dubbed 'controversial.'  Yet this book's explicitness was what made it ring so very true to this reader, a woman who was a young teen herself and who teaches them each day. This book was so honest and heartfelt and I read it in the course of one night.   <br /> <br />In addition to racism, this book explores the heartbreaking sensuality of a girls' first sexual explorations.  Maybe it's my heightened awareness to this topic due to some issues some of my students went through last year that have led me to seek out books on this issue, but I've read a lot of excellent books on this topic lately and Ms. Erian's book takes its proud place next to these others.Other books that might be good companions to this are Whores on the Hill, Prep, and Bitch Posse. <br /> <br />My only gripe with this book would be that it seems to ache for a sequel!  I hope Ms. Erian will write one sometime soon.  Brava, Ms. Erian!  More, please!	2005-10-09

As a Muslim and a woman I really related to the character Najwa. Her gradual tansformation from a spoiled, somewhat shallow teen, to a pensive, observant Muslim is a pleasure to observe. This story is fictional, but the message is definitely real and it's something that could affect anyone. Najwa loses everything and hits rock bottom, but through faith in God, she's able to gain  strength and not lose hope. This novel was wholly entertaining and superbly written. The characters were well developed, especially the despicable Anwar, one of Najwa's chief antagonists. I would recommend Minaret to anyone, especially Muslim women. I look forward to Aboulela's future novels.	2005-10-09

Crichton both criticizes our emotional nature and our attempts to hold it in check. While there are some parts of this book that seemed to make no sense, such as how people many feet below the ocean's surface survive the pressure of the water above without special gear, there are many delightful scientific explanations and natural laws carefully used as metaphor here. It's as if Thomas Pynchon decided to write a thriller with his knowledge of physics, and although the text is somewhat pulpy, it is rich and descriptive enough to both tantalize the senses and provoke the mind.	2005-10-09

RFID Sourcebook by Sandip Lahiri is a very well done title that you should investigate if you're starting to look into how RFID technology might be used in your organization...<br /><br />Contents:  Technology Overview; Advantages of the Technology; Limitations of the Technology; Application Areas; Privacy Concerns; RFID Versus Bar Code; The RFID Strategy; Creating Business Justification for RFID; Designing and Implementing an RFID Solution; Standards; Closing Thoughts; RFID Vendors, News Sources, and Conferences; Passive Tag Manufacturing Overview; Glossary; Index<br /><br />I found this book to be the type that you could legitimately use in order to plan your company's approach to RFID.  It's not a \\"rah rah\\" book that pretends that RFID is a panacea to all the manufacturing problems that exist.  It's an even-handed coverage of the subject, and he doesn't have any qualms about covering the pros and cons that you'll have to consider if you use RFID.  There's a degree of technical information in the book, but not so much that a higher-level decision maker would get bogged down in details.  I guess I'd consider it more of a strategic book to make good fundamental initial decisions, and to get your project moving in the right direction early.<br /><br />If RFID is something that your organization or industry is pursuing, grab this book to get grounded in the fundamentals.	2005-10-09

Where we may tend to regard the objective facts of a situation to be the truth of it, Ms. Slater takes a much more subjective view. She asserts her point, explicitly and in a masterful way woven seemlessly throughout the text, that there may be a more truthful way to relate a situation, a character, an anecdote, than to simply relate the facts. <br /> <br />So she leads us to wonder even about the most central elements of the story. Does she really have epilepsy? Has she ever really had a seizure? Does the doctor she cites throughout her story really exist, or is he a metaphor also? <br /> <br />While fascinating questions I found their deliberate effect a bit too successful: I couldn't trust the narrator. Unfortunately for me, that meant also that I was ultimately unable to feel close to the narrator and really understand her motivations -- perhaps, in my eyes at least, the most important role of a memoir. <br /> <br />It's a bit of a quandry that I'm left in. She's succeeded fully in doing what she set out to do. She's presented herself as something of a chronic lier; a trickster at the very least. But since I know this about her so soon, and I'm so frequently reminded, I have difficultly staving off the need to push her away. So as a memoir, instead of a piece of literary theory, I found Slater's book a bit distant.	2005-10-09

The more we listen to this cd we really love it! My daughter actually requests to hear certain songs, our favorite has sounds like running horses!    CD -   Great Wall of China - The Chinese Dragon  The book and music speaks of how on Chinese New Year there is a big dragon dance to celebrate the New Year. It talks about how Chinese drums & cymbals give you a feeling of happiness. \\" This Asian adaptation of music that is played during festive occasions\\".    Silk Road  It's music has foot bells and a tambourine in this original composition.

( It's doesn't look like a horse head at all. Imagine a square guitar with a long neck and curved handle like a cane).

Dances move deftly between bamboo poles accompanied by the rhythmic beats of copper and wooden drums\\".    Dongbei  The main instrucments in this track are Chinese drums, cymbols, erhu and banhu. This track is known as Yang Ge and is played in parades during festive celebrations where thousands of people line up to watch the parades.     Central Plains  The bamboo flute in this track imitates a singing bird and also includes an instrument called a Pipa. It is suppose to make you think a grandfather laying under a big shade tree playing his flute while his grandson chases a small bird around the tree.    Jiangnan  This track is a new version of a 200-year-old Jiangnan folk song called Jasmine Flower. The song uses the Erhu which is kinda like a violin and the Pipa. Jasmine flowers are small and white and have the sweetest scent. You are suppose to imagine sitting in a boat on the canal in Zhouzhuang.      The information in this book is unbelieveable and combined with the cd makes this set a must have for anyone who loves China! Defiantely worth adding to your home library!	2005-10-09

Considering the world's collective madness involving the threat of nuclear war and having children cower under desks in schools, madness abounded in those days.  Ken Steele's was sadly adolescent onset pychosis as opposed to the mass hysteria that was the order of the day.  He was first hospitalized following that episode.<br /><br />Steele's mental illness included paranoia; he feared going out in public and thought others were talking about him.  When Steele's brother Joe was born in 1964, he felt further alienated from his family.  On January 2, 1966 Steele left his home for good.  Sadly, he served time in and out of hospitals for the next 15 years.<br /><br />In 1974, one door opened.  Steele, calling home from an institution out of state received his first invitation home in nearly a decade.  Sadly, this visit did not pan out and he was back in the throes of mental forces he could not control.<br /><br />In 1991, Steele's luck changed for the better.  He was well matched with a Brooklyn therapist named Rita Seiden who responded to him with compassion.  I like the way she explained his mental illness to him and treated him with respect at all times.  He was referred to a Dr. Casimir in 1994 who prescribed Risperdal.  Steele began taking it in November of 1994 and on May 3, 1995, his voices stopped.  For the first time since 1962 he was free of auditory hallucinations.<br /><br />While working with Dr. Casimir, Steele took up the banner of securing the vote for mentally ill persons.  His contention that \\"mentally ill does not mean mentally incompetent\\" was on target.  In late 1994, he began working tirelessly to secure that right for people with mental illnesses.  In the late 1990s, Steele became a publisher of \\"New York City Voices: A Consumer Journal for Mental Health Advocacy\\" and an editor of a monthly newsletter of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and spoke on behalf of the National Mental Health Association's \\"Partners In Care.\\"  One thing that comes through quite plainly in this book is that Ken Steele was a truly good man.  A truly good man.  This book will touch many hearts.<br /><br />Sadly, Steele never met his brother's children.  His voice was stilled on October 7, 2000.  This book might make you cry, but Ken Steele will certainly inspire you.  His was a life etched in pain, emphasized by his compassion and his tireless quest to help others in his shoes.  Reading this book will leave an indelible impression on all readers.<br /><br />God bless Ken Steele.ehalf of the National Mental Health Association's \\"Partners In Care.\\"  One thing that comes through quite plainly in this book is that Ken Steele was a truly good man.

The deep substance in the imagery of these cards, the symbolism of Tolkien profoundly integrated with the use of the Qabalistic Tree of Life, evoke astral journeys to the very gates of heaven. If you own one of these decks, don't listen to the fuss about Crowley's Thoth deck: your LOTR tarot deck is extremely potent, and deserves a serious student's full consideration in the matters of psychic divination.<br /><br />Allow me to explain a reading: I array the cards in a \\"Tree of Life\\" pattern, starting with Kether, working down through the other nine sephiroth, finishing with Malkuth. At each card, I stop to contemplate the meaning of the card. Because the cards are so disturbingly beautiful, like a Nazareth song, I can contemplate the deeper meaning for long periods of time.<br /><br />Take this first card I drew, placing it over Kether, \\"the crown\\": \\"The Lovers - Aragorn is reunited with his love, Arwen.\\" How awesome! Aragorn is not only male, but an earthbound creature, a man (human). Arwen is Elven, she personifies the spirit world. Because Aragorn, the corporeal and earthly, has united sexually with his love, the spiritual realm, you can tell this makes a happy situation within the center of our intellectual existence. It is Tai Chi - the Great Ultimate. It symbolizes the very Gates of Heaven, which are indeed within us.<br /><br />In the position of Chockma - wisdom - I lay an Ace of Cups -- \\"Galadriel's mirror shows many things, but wisdom lies in understanding what is shown.\\" Chillingly personal. Sam kneels on a toadstool sprinkled lawn, while Frodo gazes into the mysterious vision well, under an erie and luminous moon. The Elven Queen spreads her arms over her dominion. The saying written on the card about wisdom, and this spot being the sephiroth of wisdom, is just amazing providence.<br /><br />To complete the trinity of the \\"head\\" cards, I drew the Queen of Swords for Binah, understanding. This is the Lady Eowyn, Theoden's warrior daughter. She has slain the chief of the Nazgul, and holds in her hand the severed dragon's head. The Queen of Swords in the position of the Tree of Life's sphere of \\"Spiritual Purpose\\" indicates to me a psyche whose thinking is quick, decisive, and without guile. Quick to judge, and quick to execute judgment, the female intellect is \\"hidden\\" knowledge, occult. How interesting that in the story, Lady Eowyn loves Aragorn, but Aragorn loves Arwen. Lady Eowyn takes the energy of that unrequited love, and channels it into \\"killing dragons\\". This is a metaphor for problem solving by using single minded attention, the transmutation of sexual energy into creation.<br /><br />My drawings of the remaining cards on the Tree of Life were equally impressive. I believe this reading has revealed to me strengths, and weaknesses. Take for instance, the \\"heart\\" sephiroth, the sephiroth of beauty, Tephiroth. Over it I drew the Five of Swords. The card shows \\"Pippin and Merry are captured by the Orcs, and are bound and carried away.\\" This is an amazing revelation, that the heart can be darkened by forces that occlude its brilliance within us. For myself, this is probably not such a good card to have placed over the heart/beauty sephiroth, and is therefore a good card for me to study what is wrong in myself. These forces can be actual devils, which act upon the heart the way storm clouds change the mood of an afternoon. The beauty of the innocence of Merry and Pippin is concealed in ugliness.<br /><br />The other seven cards were equally revealing and meaningful to me.<br /><br />I love the selections of scenes from the LOTR books, which predate the movie trilogy. They capture not just the essence of their ordinal card, but harmonize symbolically at successively deeper levels. One could really go to a deep level of psychic wizardry by studying these cards, I'm inclined to believe. With that, I'd finally like to say that my acquaintance with Lord of the Rings is strong and long, and the world of Middle Earth is a mythology which I take very seriously. Having read the books several times gives me some comfort with the cards, so that I don't have to struggle to understand who is whom, and I can view the story in its Gestalt, forming new and interesting relationships between cards fairly easily.<br /><br />If you are new to the world of Tolkien, the guide book by the great and famous Terry Donaldson is superb. One could read the book on its own, and gain understanding, even without the cards. The package itself is a magical combination, it is not kid stuff. Also, I tend to think the artwork slants on the shady side of the mountain, if you know what I mean. There are no sunny days with white, poofy clouds, as there are a-plenty in the Rider-Waite deck. Here, we have lots of overcast, pall, dusky twilight, and lunar mist. Also, almost all of the trees in any of the cards of this deck are without leaves. The whole deck looks like it was painted in the month of November, which, if you live in the northern region of North America, is rather bleak, and we tend to party more to compensate for the gloom. The 3 of Cups, 4 of Coins, 8 of Coins, and 6 of Swords appear to be the only cards where I can find foliage growing on trees in the art work. Even these cards show grey, pale, and misty backdrops.s strong and long, and the world of Middle Earth is a mythology which I take very seriously.

His concept is so simple, and yet so often overlooked. As I understand it, his basic point is that people often think of wars as being caused by factors such as religious differences, economics, etc. Stoessinger argues that these types of factors are necessary but not sufficient. You also need additional factors, particularly misperceptions. <br /> <br />I think that he makes a pretty decent case for this, his examples are appropriately chosen, and he makes some very interesting observations. I think many of his ideas have very great explaining power and should be a consideration in any discussion of war. <br /> <br />Definitly a recommended read, particularly if you're interested in history or political science.	2005-10-09

Much of this is accomplished in a kind of _House and Garden_ fashion.  We are shown a distinguished English country house on a hill above the Thames:<br /><br />\\"A long gabled front of red brick, with the complexion of which time and the weather had played all sorts of pictorial tricks, only, however, to improve and refine it, presented to the lawn its patches of ivy, its clustered chimneys, its windows smothered in creepers.  The house had a name and a history . . .\\"<br /><br /> . . . and so do its noble occupants, a wealthy American expatriate and his son.<br /><br />When their cousin Isabel arrives, she acquires merit in the reader's eyes by her appreciation of Gardencourt:<br /><br />\\"Her uncle's house seemed a picture made real; no refinement of the agreeable was lost upon Isabel; the rich perfection of Gardencourt at once revealed a world and gratified a need.  The large, low rooms, with brown ceilings and dusky corners, the deep embrasures and curious casements, the quiet light on dark, polished panels, the deep greenness outside, that seemed always peeping in, the sense of well-ordered privacy in the center of a `property' - a place where sounds were felicitously accidental, where the tread was muffled by the earth itself and in the thick mild air all friction dropped out of contact and all shrillness out of talk - these things were much to the taste of our young lady, whose taste played a considerable part in her emotions.\\"<br /><br />Later, Lord Warburton, a worthy English lord, acquires standing through Isabel's appreciation of his habitation, Lockleigh:<br /><br />\\". . . as they saw it from the gardens, a stout, grey pile, of the softest, deepest, most weather-fretted hue,rising from a broad, still moat, it affected the young visitor as a castle in a legend.\\"<br /><br />James advances his characterizations through dialogue as well, but not, at least in the first part of the book, through action.  His work in the first part of _The Portrait_ is like the work of Osmond, a character introduced later in the book, who executes a minute representation of an antique coin using watercolors: the representation is beautiful, it is \\"art,\\" but there is no sense of movement or striving.<br /><br />Isabel eventually inherits a fortune that makes her independent; she is courted by gallant gentlemen, and she encounters some less savory characters. This is a sad book: we don't want to see Isabel brought down to earth.  I must say I was dissatisfied with the abrupt ending of the book that fails to resolve Isabel's situation.  Even with this imperfection, this is a beautifully written novel.<br /><br />The Penguin Classics edition of _The Portrait_ is worth the price, with lovely cover art by John Singer Sargent.  It includes a useful introduction and plot summary by Geoffrey Moore (like almost all introductions to fiction, it is best appreciated after reading the book itself), a preface and notes by the author, endnotes, a chronology, and a bibliography.	2005-10-09

I tripped over its availability by accident and bought it in trust -- something I usually don't do.  And I'm delighted to say that it has been one of the best books I've read on writing in the past few years.  The chapters were short, something I had never seen in a book before.  Barbara, the author, said what she needed to say, short and crisp, she shut up and then allowed, and I use the word allow very carefully, me read the \\"set your timer\\" exercise at the end and spend my time writing.  Or I should say playing.  Playing with new ways to improve my own writing. <br /> <br />I must say since I am solely a nonfiction writer that some of the chapters that were devoted to fiction weren't of interest to me.  Then again, some of the fiction-focused ones were.  Some of them did help me improve me expand on my own style of nonfiction.  So much so that I rewrote nine articles I had previous submitted to magazines that were rejected.  As quickly as I was able to rewrite them and submit them I received acceptance notices from three.  The others are still in limbo.  Then again, its only been a few weeks.  It's nice to see that even though magazine publishers say that you will get a yes or no from them in 3 months that when you submit something that is really, really, really, good they will jump on it in days.  It made a new believer in me. <br /> <br />The bottom line...if you want to be inspired, open your mind, shift in your writing enough that will make you smile bigger, then this is the book you have got to read. <br /> <br />There are very few books I ever recommend but I do this one.  And as an avid reader on at least one book a month on writing techniques this one gets hit out of the ball park. <br /> <br />Catherine Franz	2005-10-09

Star Wars Dark Nest I: The Joiner King is the start of a new set of Star Wars novels. There is the Dark Nest Trilogy and then the nine part Legacy of The Force series. The Joiner King gives this new set of novels a very good start. The Jedi have now established themselves again and are a valuable force for good in the Post-NJO Galaxy, however there are many problems that they will have to deal with in the next series of books. Such as clearly defining their role with the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances and refining their expanded view of the force, combined with getting back to a mindset of peacekeeping after the Yuuzhan Vong war had made them a little too ruthless in their methods. This is all good as it shows that the books that follow are going to be plot rich and valuable to the Star Wars universe. Troy Denning has the classic characters down extremely well but with enough development to show that the Yuuzhan Vong War shown in the NJO 19 book series had effected them. This shows respect towards these well loved characters but indicating that Del Rey and Lucasfilm Licensing are trying to show that events in past books are not forgotten and the consequnces are shown in later books. <br /> <br /> The Joiner King has an exciting plot with potential for development over the next two books, where i expect a number of surprises will occur. Jedi Master Luke Skywalker has some good Lightsaber duels and him and leia get to learn more about their parents pasts. Really good Star Wars novel for people willing to accept that not everything is gooing to wrapped up at the end of this first book of a longer series. <br />	2005-10-09

I taught myself to knit with a DVD I bought (with the first pattern). I tend to jump into things quickly and learn the best I can as I go along, but unless you're a quick study, this should NOT be the first knitting book you pick up. There were so many wonderful patterns in it that I couldn't resist, but if this is the only knitting book you've ever read, you get the impression that all knitters have unlimited money to spend on their knitting (I calculated--knitting the cashmere sweater will run you about $600 at least), can knit at the speed of light, and are extensively knowledgeable about every yarn in the world.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the book did force me to grow into a pretty good knitter in an extremely short space of time. I also learned about the folly of substituting yarns without testing and careful reading. I have made several of the flower washcloths--they make simply wonderful gifts, no matter what age or gender you are--the berkshire sweater, which was sort of a disaster because I changed both needles and yarn and basically doubled the numbers in the pattern (it's wearable but sort of strange-looking), the pillow, with a cheap cotton instead of silk/cashmere (!) as suggested, the lap blanket, the mohair camisole, and a few pairs of the fingerless mitts.<br /><br />The book is good if, like I said, you have unlimited time and money to spend on knitting, or are a good substituter, and if you like the unique projects in the book. Some of the projects seem unnecessarily complicated (brioche in the round? for an ordinary hat?), and some are just silly (a hemp cardigan? for a baby?), but it has lovely pictures, and if you knit the projects correctly, they come out exactly as picture-perfect as the ones in the photos.<br /><br />-Six-month knitter	2005-10-09

From it's beginnings as more of a Japanese JJ style into the unique style known as Gracie JJ developed by Helio Gracie and brothers.  <br /> <br />The book contains 103 self-defense techniques that deal with common street attacks. Although most are very basic techniques, it's these techniques that work when it counts! I read lots of bad reviews on this book but personally I think those people were searching for fancy stuff or more sportive BJJ material, which this book is not. Street self defense should be basic and reliable not fancy!  <br /> <br />Other complaints I have heard about this book is that it is disorganized and that related techniques are spread throughout the book rather than lumped together. The reason being is that they are showing you the techniques as a lesson plan. You're not going to learn 5 different headlock escapes at once before moving to the next type of attack. What is done, is you are shown a \\"basic\\" series of self-defense techniques as your base to work from. Once you have learned those techniques you are then ready for the next level of the same techniques which include variations of them. This is how the book is laid out and makes good sense to me.  <br /> <br />Anyhow, I recommend this book not only for a look at Gracie JJ as it used to be but for the fact that lots of these techniques are reliable when it counts. <br />	2005-10-09

However, this worthy goal is marred by Harris' clumsy style and questionable accuaracy.    At its best, Harris' writing is unsteady and full of the false bravado of a never-before-published author. At its worst, it is simply juvenile, full of the 'nee-ner, nee-ner' spite of a small child tattling on an errant sibling. What Harris does not seem to realize is that the comedy of his subject's statements stands on its own. His attempts to punch-up the humor through his commentary often punches it out instead. Also, as a stylistic note, Harris would have been well served by having an editor explain to him that using single-sentence paragraphs to emphasize a point can be very effective.    When used in moderation.    The issue of Harris' inaccuracy is most likely a matter of overzealousness. While his quotes seem to be accurate, many are presented with no consideration for their context. Harris engages in the sort of selective hearing that has made Michael Moore such a well-respected political commentator.    Any potential buyer for this book should ask herself the following question: \\"Am I looking for thoughtful commentary, or snide dismissal?\\" If the answer is the latter, then she should by all means purchase The Sanctity of Marriage Handbook. Some of the hypocrisy highlighted is wickedly funny, despite the author's commentary. If, however, she is looking for the former, she would be better served by spending her money elsewhere.	2005-10-09

Jungle Lore has fascinating accounts of Corbett's experiences in the Jungles on the foothills of Himalayas in India.  <br /> <br />From his early childhood when he used to venture into the jungles armed with a catapult (from which he graduated to pellet-bow followed by a muzzle-loader and finally rifles),  Corbett absorbed as much as he could about the way of the jungle. He says that jungle lore is not a science that can be learnt in textbooks; it can only be absorbed, little at a time, for \\"the book of nature has no beginning, as it has no end.\\" Based only on his observations, Corbett describes a wide variety of birds, animals, and reptiles living in the jungles, and classifies them into different categories based on their behavior, eating habits, role in maintaining the balance of nature, etc.  <br /> <br />Though there are certain sections of the book that describe Corbett organizing \\"beats\\" for the aristocracy (British and Indian) to hunt down tigers for sport which appear a little out of character with Corbett's avowed respect for animals (there is even a section where Corbett decides to kill a big male leopard just because he was \\"worth shooting\\"), there is no doubt that Corbett, through his books, had done more towards raising awareness on the conservation of the wild life in the jungles of India than anyone else. It's a shame that most of the jungles described in Corbett's books are slowly becoming a thing of the past, and unless desperate measures are taken, rapid population growth and indiscriminate poaching will forever deprive India of the finest of her flora and fauna.	2005-10-09

I felt every bit of his trepidation, but had to laugh when I pictured his wide, fearful eyes on their way to the operating room. <br /> <br />I cried when he drew me into the deep respect for a mother who had always demonstrated the love and caring of the mothers of yesteryear. As we witnessed her family mourning her passing into the arms of God, I had to set the book down and weep. <br /> <br />For a feel-good read of a wholesome, stirring book, full of laughter and tears, I can think of no other I would recommend more highly than River of Memories: An Appalachian Boyhood. <br />	2005-10-09

Either Dr. Joyner believes his readership is so woefully ignorant as to require the same idea be restated several paragraphs in a row in order for them to achieve comprehension, or he was given bad editorial advice to do so.  Whatever the reason may be, much of the text is subjected to this treatment... paragraph after paragraph of circular discussion around an idea that could just have easily been stated clearly in a single, concise paragraph, if not sentence.  This makes the reading of his text laborious at best.  It also detracts from its primary purpose, the educating of students in the subject of International Law.  The treatment is such that one has to question whether the text could have been more concisely rendered as a pamphlet. <br />   <br />I do not say these things lightly, nor with malice towards Dr. Joyner.  I compared this text to a 1st Edition copy of Law Among Nations: An Introduction to Public International Law by Dr. Gerhard von Glahn (deceased), Professor Emeritus in Political Science, University of Minnesota-Duluth, Minnesota (now in its 7th edition; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0205189946/002-9957070-9244802?v=glance).  Dr. von Glahn's text, by contrast, was very concise and clear.   <br /> <br />Perhaps this edition of International Law in the 21st Century: Rules for Global Governance is just a dud; an early stage of a work in progress.  I cannot, however, find any redeeming quality about the book that would warrant recommendation of it beyond that is is a newer publication then most of its peer texts.  Unfortunately, its recent publication is not enough to overcome its obvious communications flaws.  Hopefully this will be remediated in future editions.	2005-10-09

It also has the subtlety of a soap opera, and it likes to beat us the readers over the head with victimhood, suffering, sadness and futility. Child writes exceptionally well in a simple, conversational style, but his book needs an edit and before he writes another, he should give these characters and situations more depth.

Our team strives to make them usable. I have always preferred to leave security to the security professional. Maybe that's not working.

User authentication and authorization complaints rank right at the top in most help staff logs. This book may provide some alternatives to passive acceptance of things as they are.<br /><br />It is hard to summarize a 750 page book with over 60 contributors. There is a lot here for a broad range of interests. Yes, some chapters have a load of mind-numbing jargon, but as a whole, this material is very approachable by the professions I mentioned above. Many of the contributors are from the ranks of the same professions. Stats are mixed with anecdotes in an interesting way.<br /><br />Bruce Tognazzini's \\"Design for Usability\\" was a personal favorite -- and so was the chapter on designing the interface to ZoneAlarm, a product familiar to most.<br /><br />If there is one theme that unites all the contributions, it is expressed in the title of Ch. 32: \\"Users Are Not the Enemy.\\" Amen to that.	2005-10-09

You know how you can usually pick up a book and you know, you just KNOW when you are going to have a new love in your life? Well, I found this year's love through an interesting and round about way. And I am so glad that I did. I bought the double set of \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" and \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\" from Amazon. It was my first purchase, and I am really glad I bought these, and had them shipped out all the way to Australia.  <br /> <br />I have been looking for the longest time for a great story to immerse myself into. I haven't experienced that since I first read W Somerset Maugham's short story collection. But his tales are set in a time where I find I have to make a conscious effort to understand the characters' circumstances, and that's really difficult being a child of the latter 20th century - I don't have a point of reference with Maugham. Jonathan Safran Foer is definately an accessible writer of my generation.  <br /> <br />Jonathon Safran Foer has a unique ability to allow you to fall in love with his characters, and to also let him take you into the story. I didn't find myself questioning his tale. A good story lets you flow along with it, and I was so happy to float with these characters for a while.  <br /> <br />I love the way that each and every one of the characters in this story obviously has a rich back story, and the novel could have easily focussed on any one of them. And the story definitely didn't take the easy way out. It just happened like real life does, and you couldn't ask for anything more than that, can you? I can't wait to read whatever this author comes out with next.

US	53050653	R15HNEC52SNCVJ	0465062814	185885058	Three Billion New Capitalists: The Great Shift of Wealth and Power to the East	Books	4	7	8	N	N	Prestowitz has done better work	Founder and currently President of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, D.C., during the Reagan Administration Clyde Prestowitz served as counselor to the Secretary of Commerce.  His earlier book, Trading Places, came out of his experience as a negotiator of trade agreements with Japan.  Along with his public policy experience, he has some background in economics and business (Scott Paper), but unlike most economists and businessmen he thinks the government can do a lot to enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. economy.<br /><br />The methods employed in the research for the book are similar to those used by Tom Friedman in The World is Flat - that is, non-random elite interviews and nonsystematic data collection.  Prestowitz's informants are different.  He prefers talking to engineers and factory managers around the world instead of the  business leaders and politicians favored by Friedman, but like Friedman he uses anecdotes about his own family members and friends and throws in a few references to the ideas of the economists and policy makers he agrees with.  He culls quantitative data from various sources to paint a gloomy picture of the future of the United States.  The policy recommendations that he provides, because they are unlikely to be implemented, do not provide much relief.  Friedman essentially says go with the flow, while Prestowitz rages against the storm.<br /><br />One of the reasons for Prestowitz's stance is that he believes in his heart of hearts that theories of comparative advantage (sometimes called free trade theories) do not describe the reality of the times and are not a good guide to action.  While admitting in Chapter 9, ominously entitled \\"The End of the Dollar,\\" that the \\"...theory of comparative advantage is mathematically unassailable and has been elaborated over the years to form the solid underpinning of international trade theory...\\", he argues that the \\"theory rests on certain conditions\\" (p. 180) - such as perfectly competitive markets, the absence of static and dynamic economies of scale, and the absence of monopoly rents derived from intellectual property - that are currently quite typical of advanced industrial economies.  He is referring here to a branch of neo-classical economics called strategic trade theory.  Although he correctly cites Paul Krugman as an innovator in this area, he neglects to tell the reader that Krugman and most other mainstream economists disowned strategic trade theory shortly after it was invented because of the arguments of other economists about the negative consequences of retaliation.<br /><br />Prestowitz abhors the fiction maintained by many U.S. policy makers that protectionist and industrial policies practiced by foreign governments hurt them more than us and so do not need to be confronted in any way:<br /><br />Why did they make a defense that rested on an unreal view of the world?  ...inertia, the strength of academic tradition, the old fear of protectionism, and the ingrained view that if the other guy subsidizes and protects, you are still better off with free trade. (p. 183)<br /><br />Despite his skepticism about the theory of comparative advantage, Prestowitz believes in one of its important corollaries: factor price equalization.  \\"...the addition of 3 billion new capitalists to the global labor pool almost overnight in the context of instant worldwide communications and networked production with express delivery is likely to have an equalizing effect on many wages.  There is no doubt that Asian wages will rise, but the interval could be long.\\" (p. 186)  Prestowitz parts company with both Friedman and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology on this question. The latter argue that the \\"only way to win is to do things no one else can do...\\" (p. 187) Prestowitz thinks bad times are ahead for the United States because many of those things increasingly can be done where labor costs are lower.<br /><br />In Chapter 10, \\"The Comfortable Road to Ruin,\\" Prestowitz focuses on the danger of depending on China to lend money to the U.S. Treasury to finance the U.S. balance of payments deficit.  Like many others, he thinks that in the long run \\"Americans will have to adjust to a falling dollar and pressure for less consumption and more saving.\\" (p. 189)  Of course, he is not alone in calling attention to this.  C. Fred Bergsten, George Soros, Robert Rubin, Bill Clinton, Paul Volcker, Nouriel Roubini, and a variety of other economists, business leaders, and policy makers have made the same argument. Thus, it is not particularly original.  The same can be said for Prestowitz's recommendations that social security should be saved by delaying retirement benefits, that income taxes should become consumption taxes, that the United States should become more energy independent, and that fuel efficiency standards should be extended to SUVs.  We have seen similar lists frequently in the last few decades.  It would be more helpful, in my view, if instead of such a list, we got an analysis of why such obvious remedies have not been adopted - who is for them and who against.  But that would be more like what a social scientist would do./>In Chapter 10, \\"The Comfortable Road to Ruin,\\" Prestowitz focuses on the danger of depending on China to lend money to the U.S. Treasury to finance the U.S. balance of payments deficit.

Walter Isaacson could not pick a more fascinating person to write about, nor more interesting events.  In his \\"pragmatic\\" approach to life, Benjamin Franklin became one of society's top diplomats, scientists, inventors, statesman, and journalists (I wouldn't really refer to him as a philosopher, as some do).  His plethora of pithy maxims and practical inventions are truly remarkable, all the more incredible given Franklin's Founding Father status.  As Isaacson points out, Franklin was the only person who signed the Declaration of Independence, Treaties with England and France to end the Revolutionary War, and U.S. Constitution.    Isaacson also aptly describes Franklin's imperfections.  He virtually abandoned his wife and children by spending a great deal of time in Europe, half of that time on rather frivolous pursuits.  He loved to flirt with women, often much younger than himself, in a fashion that would certainly be highly frowned upon today.  Additionally, Franklin was pro-England for longer than any of the other great men that founded our country, and later fell in love (almost embarassingly so) with France.    With warts and all though, Isaacson successfully demonstrates the influence of Franklin's views regarding the virtues of democracy in general, and the tradesmen middle class in particular.  Unlike the other Founding Fathers, he had an unadulterated faith in the common man, and a distrust of the elite, and also managed to invent the lightening rod and bifocals along the way.    One of my favorite parts of the book is the last chapter, where Isaacson describes the evolution of different attitudes towards Benjamin Franklin.  Basically, more pragmatic eras admire him, while more romantic eras don't.  I would think that it would be fair to say that, presently, Franklin has been elevatedto Demi-God Founding Father status, together with Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, and perhaps a few others.    I have the same quibbles as some of the other reviewers.  I believe the book is about 50 pages longer than it need be.  It's not necessary for the author to repeatedly tell us about Franklin's views on religious tolerance, for instance.  The multiple descriptions of his flirtatious affairs with some of the women in France seem endless at times.  Also, I believe Isaacson sometimes overstates Franklin's importance in forming the nation's governmental form, although his leadership in securing France's cooperation with the colonies during the Revolutionary War cannot be questioned.  I rather doubt that he was so important to the Constitutional Compromise, though he might have occasionally smoothed over rough waters (as he liked to do with a \\"magic\\" wand which would release oil to calm a choppy lake).    Still, \\"Benjamin Franklin - An American Life,\\" is well worth the read, and should be part of any decent library containing biographies of important Americans.  Also, check out the Amazon review by Newt Gingrich.  He's a good writer, and I sort of miss his presence in Congress, even though he's politically well to the right of me.	2005-10-09

Walter Mosley is one of the Great Contemporary American Writers, and he achieves this status from his reworking of a familiar genre - Raymond Chandler styled detective fiction - and giving it a fresh voice.<br /><br />Easy Rawlins has the hallmarks of a Sam Spade, if you like, but he's an unwilling detective, a black man who just wants to get ahead in the promising environment of post-war Los Angeles. But he's thrown into a mystery that takes us, page-turningly, through the various strata of LA society and leads us both to a statisfying yet violent resolution of the whodunnit, while also taking us to a place of deeper understanding.<br /><br />In fact Mosley's series of Easy Rawlins stories that follow this excellent novel maintain the high quality of suspense writing while tracing a credible, thoughtful post-war social history of modern USA, as seen through the astute and increasingly wary eyes of Rawlins. The series is great reading, and while Mosley uses the suspense genre to tell a deeper story he always writes with wry humour, deep passion, an eye for the ladies and a twitchy attitude to violence as part of life. His invention of Raymond \\"Mouse\\" as Rawlin's disturbingly trigger-happy friend from Texas keeps the plotting always one step from catastrophe.<br /><br />This is one novel, incidentally, where the film version is every bit as good. Denzel Washington captures Easy Rawlins just perfectly, and the film direction is quite superb.	2005-10-09

Sam Flood is an Australian mathematician who has decided to search out her roots, after discovering that her paternal grandmother came to Australia as a result of the now infamous relocation scheme for children from orphanages and those who had been abandoned by their parents. Sam locates a local woman who had been a fellow traveler on the ship and who tells a horrified Sam about the barbaric treatment given by church authorities and social service organisations, to those helpless children... a time of great shame in Australian history! Miguel Madero, known as Mig, is the son of a noble Spanish house and is recovering from a bad fall, taken when he was rock climbing, during a break from his studies at a seminary. Unsure whether or not to return to the seminary as he is reconsidering his vocation to the priesthood, Mig also travels to Illthwaite to do some research for his doctorate in the history of religious persecution in 16th century England, with particular interest in an ancestor with the same name. The locals close ranks when Sam and Mig, separately and together, question them about several deaths and a suicide which could affect their research, and Reginald Hill takes this opportunity to introduce lots of fascinating characters, all worthy of a place in an English murder/mystery novel. I found this to be a great read with overtones of murder,historical themes and complex characters crowding the pages, and just enough sex to keep it interesting.	2005-10-09

Read through this book and you'll realize he just doesn't have a single compelling argument.        A few years ago, I attended a debate featuring Mr. Craig at UCLA.  I had seen some transcripts of his earlier debates posted on his website at LeadershipU, so I printed out some copies and brought them along.      I was pleased, but not surprised, to discover that Mr. Craig's entire presentation was a memorized, word-for-word recital of the script he had used for these previous debates.  Obviously, if you're counting the number of arguments presented, Mr. Craig will win because he's reading from a prepared text and his opponent isn't.      For example, Mr. Craig quotes a set of improbably odds for certain prophecies being fulfilled.  To the annoyance of the people around me, I said out loud, \\"Mr. Craig, what do mathematicians say about the odds?\\"  And a moment later, behind the podium on stage, Mr. Craig recited the same line, \\"Well, if you listen to mathematicians, you might be interested to hear what they have to say.\\"       This book gives about half of his \\"standard\\" opening argument.  It allows you to study exactly which points he will raise at a debate, and therefore his opponents are becoming better prepared to refute them.       For example, science has discovered several methods to accurately date the \\"Big Bang.\\"  Once you get the picture clear in your mind, it's obvious that our universe began as an explosion, not an Act of Creation.  Add in the possibility of our universe being one of an infinite array of universes, and it seems likely that our \\"Big Bang\\" was nothing more than a leak from some previous universe.       Thus, Craig's entire rant about the First Cause argument is refuted.  Yes, our universe had a naturalistic cause, as did the one before it, as did the one before it, and there is never even the faintest suggestion of an Intelligent Designer in the evidence.    Let me show you Craig's approach (which rhymes with smoke and mirrors):    \\"Very simply, something cannot come out of absolutely nothing. A pure potentiality cannot actualize itself. In the case of the universe (including any boundary points), there was not anything physically prior to the initial singularity. On the atheistic hypothesis, there did not even exist the potentiality for the existence of the universe. But then it seems inconceivable that the universe should become actual if there did not exist any potentiality for its existence. It seems to me therefore that a little reflection leads us to the conclusion that the origin of the universe had a cause.  From the nature of the case involved, that cause must have transcended space and time (at least sans the universe) and therefore be uncaused, changeless, eternal, immaterial, and enormously powerful. Moreover, as I have argued elsewhere, the cause is most plausibly construed to be personal. For the only way in which a temporal effect could originate from an eternal, changeless cause would seem to be if the cause is a personal agent who eternally chooses to create an effect in time. A changeless, mechanically operating cause would produce either an immemorial effect or none at all. Therefore, the cause of the universe is plausibly regarded as personal...\\"          Mr. Craig doesn't understand the current theories about how the universe began, but he jumps over a couple of barrels (ie, what exactly is an immemorial effect?) and comes to the conclusion that \\"the cause of the universe is plausibly regarded as personal...\\"         How is it personal?         If a firecracker explodes, was it \\"caused by a personal Creator\\" because a human being hears it?         Mr. Craig starts from the unwarranted assumption \\"there was not anything physically prior to the initial singularity...\\"         Science has NEVER said that, even in the retro-1950's version of the Big Bang theory that Mr. Craig uses.         And this is his BEST argument for a Creator God.             The simple truth is, there is absolutely no evidence that a God exists.  And Mr. Craig can neither produce nor invent any.         Would a Creator God leave evidence?  No matter how you answer that question, the undeniable fact is there is NO evidence for a Creator God in the known universe.         So, I would have to say that no, Mr. William Lane Craig does not win these debates.  The Truth wins.	2005-10-09

This New York Times best selling novel is a beautifully written, coming of age story, set in rural South Carolina in 1964 against the back drop of the civil rights movement. It is the touching story of a young white girl, fourteen year old Lily Owens, whose mother died in a tragic accident when Lily was about four. Lily lives with her father, a harsh man with whom no love is lost, on a peach farm outside Sylvan, South Carolina. Her mother's death stands between them.<br /><br />Neglected by her father, Lily is brought up by Rosaleen, a big-hearted black woman, who loves Lily and whom Lily loves. Yet, hers is a lonely existence, compounded by her unquenched thirst for information about her mother, Deborah. All she has left of her mother are some cloudy memories and a box containing a few mementos, among them a picture of a Black Madonna, inscribed with the words, \\"Tiburon, S.C.\\"<br /><br />When Rosaleen goes into town to register to vote, she feels empowered by the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and has a run-in with the town's three biggest racists, resulting in Rosaleen being taken into custody. Lily arranges for her to break free. Together, they seek sanctuary in Tiburon, South Carolina, where Lily discovers the mystery of the Black Madonna.<br /><br />Taken in by a trio of middle-aged black women who are sisters, as well as beekeepers, Lily is introduced to the secret life of bees and begins to learn some important life lessons. She also learns something about her mother and finds love where she least expected.<br /><br />This is simply a beautifully realized novel, written in a true Southern voice by a wonderful writer with a story to tell. It is little wonder that this compelling book has received so many accolades. It is a stunning fiction debut by the author.	2005-10-09

THE LAYING ON OF HANDS by Brenda Rhodes Miller<br /><br />October 9, 2005<br /><br />Amazon rating 4 stars<br /><br />THE LAYING ON OF HANDS by Brenda Rhodes Miller takes place in the South where \\"Miss Muchie\\" is born and raised to be a healer. Her father and his mother are both healers, and when her grandmother Tyler Mama realizes Muchie has the gift, she begins training Muchie to follow in their footsteps.<br /><br />The novel's narration begins in the early 1900's in Buccatunna Mississippi. Miss Muchie works with her grandmother to learn how to use the herbs that add to their healing powers, and accompanies her grandmother when she delivers babies all over the county.  Her grandmother is a very highly respected woman in their community, known for her knowledge of herbs and medicine. It is Tyler Mama's wish for Muchie to take over after she passes on.<br /><br />As she grows older, Muchie finds she is able to heal others with her power, but what she also learns is that for some reason, she cannot help those closest to her.  She begins to doubt her faith, and wishes she did not have this gift of healing.<br /><br />While Muchie is still of school age, she falls in love with a man who arrives in town with a group of ministers who come to build a real school.  Muchie is much too young for Edward Preston or \\"Teddy\\" as his close friends call him, but eventually they find a way to be together and start their new life in Mobile, Alabama.  Their time together is a happy time, but when tragedy strikes, Muchie isn't sure she wants to go on with her life.<br /><br />THE LAYING ON OF HANDS is a story of faith and perseverance at the hands of tragedy, but it is also a look back in time.  The Civil War brought the freeing of the slaves, and Muchie's life mirrors the life of those who came after slavery, but before the time of the Civil Rights movement and the women's right to vote.  Muchie lived in a time where it was difficult to survive alone as a black woman, but with the help of loved ones and friends, she overcomes tragedies and makes a life for herself and her children.  I enjoyed this book and loved the character of Muchie.  I'm giving this book 4 stars.	2005-10-09

Jessica Hendra's book is a stunningly clear-eyed and calm description of a chaotic and even ghastly time - basically her first 30 years.  <br /> <br />Growing up is the stuff of great writing - and she has a lot to contribute to the canon. Her story is not just how incest crippled her, but what life was like in the 70's in New York City as a punk teenager and it's about becoming an actress, a wife and a mother. There is even what life's like in a London squat. It's a good, interesting read. On the other hand, it would be inappropriate to describe the incest, the battle almost to the death with anorexia, a life held hostage by a meglomaniac, that way, as \\"good\\".  Insightful, wisening, haunting seem more appropriate words. <br /> <br />Telling the truth is seldom appreciated, it is often attacked. Jessica Hendra is brave to tell this terrible, humilating, shameful truth. Her father's stunning hypocrisy of describing himself as a saved religious Catholic when he forgot to get forgiveness for the pretty major sin of incest would almost be funny if it wasn't so not funny. It is actually Jessica who is the good Catholic by not ignoring the sins of incest or hypocrisy. She had no choice but to set the record straight.  <br /> <br />What her father did to her has had one positive outcome: he made her a writer - he gave her a story and the occassion to tell it.	2005-10-09

The author of \\"Dreadnought\\" is Robert (not Richard) K. Massie.<br /><br />I was looking forward to reading Conroy's book. I bought it after reading Massie's book, about the British and German naval buildups leading to the First World War, and Hannah Pakula's, \\"An Uncommon Woman,\\" about Empress Vicky, the mother of Kaiser Wilhelm. Some years ago, I had read \\"The Kaiser and His Court,\\" a memoir by one of the Kaiser's admirals. Although the Victorian era is not my chief interest, I spent two years giving guided tours in a Victorian mansion and learned more about the customs of that day.<br /><br />Conroy has obviously read \\"Dreadnought\\" as well, and including Count von Holstein as a sinister presence was an interesting touch. I enjoyed the battle scenes, and it was an interesting reversal to have Halsey die in the book's Battle of the Atlantic.<br /><br />Having said all that, I had to struggle to finish the book because it was so irritating. Whatever Conroy has read about social customs and manners of that day, he has forgotten. This wouldn't matter so much if he stuck to writing about battles, but he insists on including a romance between an officer and an heiress. People like Conroy are a reason why snobs are snobs. The man is tone-deaf about the behavior of anyone who doesn't hang out at pool halls. If he wrote a story about the British Royal Family, he would have the Queen addressing her husband as \\"Phil.\\"<br /><br />Conroy's heiress receives a male caller unchaperoned and even lets him move in as a house guest. Her visitor, a college-educated man, is surprised to find that the Schuyler family is as prominent as it is and that it goes back so far in American history. He refers to her servants as \\"hired hands,\\" answers her in the negative at one point by saying \\"Naw,\\" and uses words like \\"lingo.\\" When they decide to get married, they have trouble locating a Protestant chaplain, so they use a Catholic priest, who willingly complies.<br /><br />In terms of how middle and upper class people actually behaved 100 years ago, this is ridiculous beyond belief. Conroy might as well write a novel in which Woodrow Wilson leaves the White House every Saturday night, goes to a jazz club in a poor part of Washington, and plays the piano with a group of black musicians. When his first wife dies, he marries a woman who is noted advocate of open marriage and, since his Presbyterian minister is ill, has the ceremony performed by a rabbi who happens to be a good friend.<br /><br />I know this is meant as a novel of military history, but it is Conroy himself who insists on including a romance, and he gets it wildly wrong. His notions of how the other half lives evidently come from \\"The Inquirer\\" or Jerry Springer. Find the battle sections of the book and skip the rest. And if you would really like to dig into that period, read \\"Dreadnought\\" (or \\"Juggernaut,\\" should Massie ever write a book by that title!) and \\"An Uncommon Woman.\\"arried, they have trouble locating a Protestant chaplain, so they use a Catholic priest, who willingly complies.

The vantage point enjoyed by the author certainly reflects in this \\"big picture\\" viewpoint of one of the better known company's growth. Of particular interest is the notion of innovation ( spelt with an \\"i\\") dealing with process improvements and Innovation (spelt with an \\"I\\") dealing with business model changes. The author provides an interesting discussion on what constitutes innovation and how FedEx defined (or didnt define) it. The rest of the book explains how a 5-dimensional employee base can be created. This discussion is certainly novel and adds some interesting perspective for anyone involved in managing people and/or processes.   <br /> <br />Though the book will certainly please any \\"managerial-type\\" reader, I was a bit disappointed to see that the author's vast engineering experience was essentially untapped in this book. There is no meaningful discussion on the operational side of \\"how \\" FedEx actually implemented innovation....In that sense, the title is a little misleading for an engineering-minded reader.  Regardless, this is an excellent read, provides a different perspective on how innovation should be seen, and a broad paradigm that enables developing an employee-base committed to and thriving on innovation.  A good read.  (It may be interesting to read this book along with the autobiography of Kinko's founder - \\"Copy This!\\".  FedEx's buying of Kinkos is discussed in this book and for even a casual observer the synergy between these two companies seems real.)	2005-10-09

A friend and I were out shopping a few weeks ago and we both picked up Bob Dylan's \\"No Direction Home: The Soundtrack\\" CD,  which is the 7th volume in Dylan's archival Bootleg Series, and also the soundtrack for Martin Scorsese's excellent PBS documentary of the same title. The album is outstanding and now that my shopping pal's birthday is coming up, Halloween actually, I decided that Dylan's \\"Lyrics, 1962-1985\\" would be a near perfect gift. She is a major Dylan fan, as am I, and we have been for almost forty years. Time flies!<br /><br />One of the deciding factors for making this purchase is that the hardcover volume edition makes an excellent, elegant presentation. The cover is laminated and each poem is printed singly on large, cream-stock pages with colored headers. Arranged by album, the book is a compilation of all of Dylan's writings and drawings, ('62 - '85), some wonderful pen sketches ranging in topic from roadside scenes to the romantic, plus 120 new compositions and an Index of song titles. \\"Lyrics, 1962-1985\\" is an extraordinary celebration of the artist's/composer's work.<br /><br /> \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" \\"Blonde on Blonde,\\" Tangled Up In Blue,\\" \\"Masters of War,\\" \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright,\\" \\"With God On Our Side,\\" \\"It Ain't Me Babe,\\" \\"My Back Pages,\\" \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" \\"Stuck Inside of Mobile With the Memphis Blues Again,\\" \\"You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go,\\" \\"Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You,\\" \\"This Wheel's On Fire,\\" \\"Shelter From The Storm,\\" etc., and hundreds of others - they're all here! Dylan's liner notes and stream-of-consciousness short prose pieces really enhance the text.<br /><br />Bob Dylan is a songwriter, musician and poet - an artistic genius and innovator whose tremendous body of work has had a major impact on over 40 years of American music, from the oldest anonymous folk ballads through blues and country into rock-and-roll. He expanded popular music by including politics, social commentary and philosophy into its vocabulary. He told more folks what was happening than the politicians and news reporters combined...and the counterculture loved him! We still do! While exploring and creating musical styles, Dylan did remain true to his roots in traditional American song.<br /><br />I am so sorry that the book is out of print.

Our hero, Alexander Short, reminds me of Indiana Jones if he was the kind of guy who hunted for relics by using library slips and zip tubes (these tubes move books from the library stacks to the front desk).  He is lured into a search for The Grand Complication-by a roguishly eccentric collector, Henry James Jesson III.<br /><br />Short, being a reference librarian with a compulsive disorder to make lists of everything in a journal knotted to his clothes, is the perfect pawn to Jesson's puppetmaster. He resolutely pursues the Grand Complication, from its disappearance in a cabinet of curiosities to a theft in Jerusalem . . . jeopardizing his job and his marriage.<br /><br />The third note-worthy protagonist in this book is the library itself and its bizarre characters and routines: George Speaight, the Librarian of Sexual Congress (actually the curator of a collection initially funded by a pornographer), Emil Dinthofer who keeps threatening to send Short to a bookmobile in Amish country; Finster Dapples, the Genealogy specialist who teaches us a lot about how to create a coat of arms, Irving Grote, the head of Conservation who goes head-to-head against Mr. Paradis, the autodidactic janitor in a library competition that tests their knowledge of the Dewey Decimal system . . .  and there's even the Sabretooths, a football team who become the recipients of a most unusual book tour.<br /><br />There's an enthralling energy to this novel that you don't expect when you consider that most of the action happens among books and paper products. Kurzweil also has a magical grasp of the macguffin and he neatly pulls off the difficult trick of entertaining as he educates us in the intricacies of full body tattoos, timepieces, heraldic self-invention, and the use of a ham sandwich as a criminal diversion.on.	2005-10-09

What happened at the San Francisco Zen Center is a riveting tale: sex, corruption, and spiritual enlightenment. I imagine the actual truth of what went on will never be known as each person involved tries to cope with their past.  So I suppose Downing had an impossible task in uncovering what really happened and that's my guess as to why he told this scandal in such a haphazard way.  Trying to follow the various personages as well as when events occurred is very difficult; Downing's chapters are just snapshots of events.  It's a shame because underneath the book, I can see glimpses of some fascinating people living in a unique time.<br /><br />Overall, the book was disappointing because there is so much potential to tell a great story.  You can see it in Chadwick's Crooked Cucumber and I think reading that book first will help a reader understand the San Francisco Zen Center and the remarkable people much better. Then come back to Shoes.  Another recommendation if you're interested in Buddhist scandal (Tibetan style) is Sherrill's The Buddha from Brooklyn.	2005-10-09

Rick Kupchella, author of Tell Me What We Did Today, is a TV news anchor and reporter in the Twin Cities. He's also a dad who wrote an important story to share with children about the everyday life of children. Warren Hanson is the illustrator of this book and of the classic, A Cup of Christmas Tea and the PEEF books. When these two men got together to create a storybook, it was a success. And it will delight children of all ages. <br /> <br />Life is made up of simple, everyday experiences. And sharing those experiences, real or made up, is a wonderful way for parents or grandparents to connect with their children or grandchildren. And that is what Kupchella's book accomplishes. It's a zany, rollicking, wild and fun ride into the real, the made up, and the big things and little things of life.  <br /> <br />I always enjoy rhyming children's books and those that allow children to interact. Kupchella's book does both. His prose is in rhyme and he asks silly questions that elicit responses, usually a Noooooooo, from the children. And Hanson's bright, big and bold illustrations are oh, so inviting. <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: Kupchella believes there is nothing better than sitting down at the day's end with your children and laughing with them.

I bought this book, thinking that it would offer some insight into Amazon.com in terms of what it was like to work there during its halcyon days.  Touted as a funny memoir, among other things, I was to discover that it was none of what was promised. In fact, the book was painfully difficult to read, as it was very poorly written, decidedly not funny, and offered little insight into what it really was like to work at Amazon. It was totally sophomoric in terms of what it did say.<br /><br />The author should be thankful that he was not fired by Amazon, as that is what he richly deserved to have happen based upon his own account of what he was like as an employee. He was a total  slacker who treated customers with the contempt that he felt that they deserved. He was totally wasteful of the company's resources. He proudly stole supplies in bulk from the company. When toys were given to him for review purposes, he not only did not bother to review them, he then refused to return the toys to Amazon. He may think that all this is hilarious. Unfortunately, I do not. Reading this drivel felt like it took twenty-one dog years.<br /><br />Moreover, this book was so poorly written, I am surprised that a reputable publisher went ahead with the expense of actually publishing it. Don't waste your time with this drivel. If you want to read a well-written, interesting book about working at Amazon, read \\"Amazonia: Five Years at the Epicenter of the Dot.

An endless stream of articles, books and conferences have remarked on the appearance, in many notable lives, of the supposed fraternal twins of madness and creativity. <br /> <br />However, most severe mental illnesses are now known to be plain old physical illnesses in line with Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and epilepsy: brain diseases, period. And the acutely psychotic, like most other profoundly ill people, are in an agony that fills their every pore and leaves no room for what art snobs, social historians and psycho-dabblers call \\"creativity.\\" That's not to say that disease and infirmity can't have an effect on the creative impulse. But it's more likely that most art and achievement of \\"genius\\" related to illness is made during periods of remission and convalescence--or, for the fortunate, after the illness has passed--than it is during illness's full flower. Anyone who has faced the devastation of cancer and its treatment, of a grinding depression, or of a bone pain that no drug can allay--will tell you that when such an illness has its claws in deep, it's impossible to even think about lifting a hand to write the book, compose the symphony or paint the masterpiece. Only during an ebb, however brief, is there hope enough to plant a bulb in the earth, make love or write a story idea on the back of an envelope. <br /> <br />It's time to stop glamorizing the manifestation of \\"madness\\" as a conduit to creativity, and take a hard look at what the lives of the mentally ill are really like. If you really want the insider's view on severe mental illness, toss aside your copy of Girl, Interrupted or The Bell Jar and read Ken Steele's remarkable book detailing his bout with schizophrenia, The Day the Voices Stopped. <br /> <br />Oftentimes, it takes someone who has been to the other side and back to truly communicate how horrid severe mental illness is. It's even more remarkable when this person can reach out to other people and effect social change. In this singular memoir, Steele documents his 32 years dealing with his schizophrenia. From age 14 he was plagued by voices urging him to kill himself, to burn himself alive--not thoughts, actually, but voices, like a radio station that can't be turned off, voices that override and jumble together with the sounds of the real world. Steele's book describes a life in and out of mental institutions, the abuse he suffered in substandard facilities, his loss of family and identity, and the fateful day that he entered a treatment program and was offered Risperdal, a new antipsychotic medication. Remarkably, several months later, his hallucinations stopped altogether. <br /> <br />It's a riveting story, and Steele's description of the day the voices stopped allows someone who has never experienced auditory hallucinations to appreciate the relief and fear that comes in such a moment: <br /> <br />One minute the voices were babbling away; the next they were gone--replaced by a persistent, mantra-like om from the living room air conditioner. Something must be wrong with it, I thought. ... I turned the air-conditioner off ... only to be accosted by a loud whir from the electric motor connected to my newly installed tropical fish aquarium and the drip-drip-drip of water, like the steady beat of a drum, trickling from the filter into the tank. ... I was being bombarded by the everyday noises. ... I turned on the television and the radio, switching from channel to channel and station to station in a frantic attempt to tune my voices back in. I wanted them to return! Even when I was homeless they lived with me. ... Without them, I felt very much alone. ... What lay before me? How would I deal with it? Whatif they were truly gone and, with them, the world as I'd known it for more than thirty years? What would I do? How would I function? <br /> <br />There is a moment in the film Awakenings when Robert De Niro is briefly released from his catatonia by an experimental drug. Imagine that this sort of awakening will soon happen to many schizophrenics like Steele: People who have spent their lives in institutions or on the street will suddenly be effectively treated after years of illness. It's a miracle that can quite quickly turn into another type of hell, because it's also something we're not ready for. Where will these people go? Who will help them find places to live when their disability benefits disappear because they are no longer classified as ill and have to get a job? And how will they apply for a job and explain 5-, 10-, 20-year lapses on their resume? <br /> <br />From his remarkable experience and effective treatment, Steele saw that this future was coming, and he made it his priority to become one of our country's most outspoken advocates for the treatment of the mentally ill. He founded a mental health advocacy newsletter, New York City Voices, and started the Voter Empowerment Project, which registered over 28,000 disenfranchised mentally ill voters in New York so that they could vote on policies that would directly effect their lives. He spoke publicly about his experiences to the mentally ill, their family members and to professionals. He started a support group called, appropriately, Awakenings. This peer-run support group helped those with schizophrenia and other psychotic mental illnesses live functional lives; deal with feeling abandoned by siblings, children and parents; and deal with explaining their medical history to their employers. <br /> <br />Ken Steele died suddenly of heart failure last October. In his book he wrote that he hoped to see his miracle become ordinary, and to see the suffering endured by the severely mentally ill and their families someday subside. Steele's life, ravaged and nearly destroyed by schizophrenia, but given back to him by medication and his own grit, shows the most beautiful creation that can come from illness: the art of human compassion. Steele demonstrated that each life, no matter how wretched or hopeless it may appear at times, always contains this possibility.	2005-10-09

What a doggie	I had to pile high a whole bunch of mob books for a project, and this one was at the very top. Now it is at the bottom and is going back tomorrow. Total \\"dreck.\\" <br /> <br />When you compare this with all the classic mob books out there, from Wise Guys to the Valachi Papers to, more recently, Born to Steal, this one just doesn't come within a mile. It is nothing more than a padded compendium of second-hand mob lore. <br /> <br />What really struck me was that the author of this book was a reporter who covered the mob for many years. That being the case, where's the beef? The \\"automatic revolver\\" goof is just one aspect of a man who seems to have only limited information on what he is writing about. <br /> <br />He promises, assuming he meant the title seriously, to tell us about the mob rising again. But he doesn't actually write about that. As a matter of fact, if he had done his job and told the story of the rising ethnic crime groups, ranging from the Russians to Vietnamese, he would have given this book another title. The phony title is an example of the sloppiness of this book.  <br /> <br />I'd suggest to people interested in the mob that they stick to the best books out there on the subject: Wise Guys by Nick Pileggi, as I said before, the best on mob lifestyle and an inside view of \\"blue collar\\" mob schemes. Born to Steal on securities fraud. Valachi Papers on the origins of the mob in the thirties. Little Man by Robert Lacey, on Meyer Lansky, is a good companion piece. <br /> <br />All the books I have cited have original research, which differentiate them from the clip job Raab has produced.	2005-10-09

In The Pull of the Moon, she has written of Nan, a woman of 50 who is having a mid-life crisis. Her body is changing in the way that makes all women realize that they are no longer young and many choices are behind them. It is a time when regrets and realizations take over. Nan, with no one to talk to, takes to the road. She encounters many people she would never have encountered at home. There is the waiter who collects angels, the young housewife being abused by her husband, and the woman in her 80's who knows exactly what Nan is going through and impresses upon Nan that all women are different and face it differently. It is this compassion for other people that makes The Pull of the Moon worthy of being read. <br /> <br />Fans of Berg's will delight in the appearance of Ethan from Until the Real Thing Comes Along. Nan is observant and kind enough to understand his dilemma. <br /> <br />While some may consider Nan's passage as selfish, I think the book proves that it is the opposite. Only when a person comes to terms with herself can she be the spouse, the mother, or friend to others.	2005-10-09

We all have inborn traits that either help us succeed or make us our own worst enemy. This book is great because it points out that the real secret is knowing what those traits are for yourself. And it shows how to develop and use them to find the right fit for you. <br /> <br />The entrepreneurial stories are fascinating, but I also found it interesting as a parent. If you recognize a child's inborn tendencies early, you can help create the evironments and conditions that make the most of what they're naturally good at. That gives them an early experience of success, which the book says is important. <br /> <br />This is not just another useless business book.	2005-10-09

I also suspect that he genuinely likes being a Catholic - and that comes through in his writing. I have owned the book for a number of years and have read it almost ragged.I now give it as gifts to Catholic friends of a certain age who start to say, \\"Wait. What is this all about, anyway?\\"  <br />In particular, I applaud the chapter on tradition (customs) versus Tradition (non-scriptural sources of doctrine, such as the writings of St. Augustine and the other Church Fathers.)This area is a source of confusion and contention to many, and I think Johnson's explanation is excellent. <br />I would recommend this book to anyone, high school age and up, of any faith.	2005-10-08

The result is It's Hard To Believe With No Salt, No Sugar, a culinary compendium of \\"kitchen cook friendly\\" dishes that range from Strawberries & Cream; to Shrimp & Pasta; to Orka & Tomatoes; to Stuffed Turkey Burgers; to Banana Pudding. The recipes are laid out plain and simple for even the most novice kitchen chef to follow accurately and successfully.

I have taught Eng. classes for years with many of his books and consider him the modern Dickens, and have no doubt history will agree in some far-flung future.  <br />   Sadly, over the past few years, a King story is a waste of money if not an out-and-out rip-off, complete with a whining self-serving explanation of an afterward that claims that this is just the way the story HAD to be.  <br />   Save it for the rubes, pal.

A one year conscript army and a totally untrained reserve would have made any doctrine unusable and thus made defeat likely. With an army such as that prepared by France in 1940 it is unlikely they could have made even their own version of mechanized warfare effective. This book will put paid to the arguments that the French officers paid little or no attention to mechanization, modern doctrine or were simply negligent.	2005-10-08

This sort of set-up often comes across as a bit forced or clumsy, and it does here as well at various points. The start for one, but one's resignations about the form are quickly set aside once the narrator, Petal, starts to recount the day of the actual attack--how she learned of it while having sex with neighbor, her attempts to get to the site, the physical and emotional aftermath once she arrives.  This and what comes right afterward holds the attention for a while, but as the book goes on, the clumsiness of the premise begins to feel more and more noticeable. <br />  Other problems start to arise as well.  For one, Petal's voice struck me as wildly inconsistent.  A lower-middle class women, at times she speaks in wonderfully true to life mode, capturing the bemusement, anger, sarcasm, self-doubt in just the right language and her sharp moments of grief pepper the book with brilliantly captured pain, but at other times the language comes across as more artificial, overly poetic, too ironically self-aware.  And, painfully, too didactic at times. <br />   The side-plots involving romance, class consciousness (too broadly done), and then her work with the police and what she finds out  there (too implausible) weaken the book, untethering it from the strongest points--a mother's grief and a city's response. <br />   The characters veer too often toward caricature, especially the upper class ones, or flatness, to overcome problems of plot and while Petal's grieving voice reminds us periodically of the book's potential, in the end it has traveled too far from its core strength.  Not a bad book, but a disappointing one.	2005-10-08

I never really got one hundred percent into it. I would find myself thinking about alot of other things while I was reading. Once I even had to backtrack almost fifty pages because I couldn't remember a single thing that I had read in the past two or three hours. I had to really focus to be able to comprehend and remember what it was that I was actually reading.<br /><br /> But anyway, enough about that and more about what the book was really about.The story is based in England, somewhere not to far away from London. These sort of capsule type of things come down and create big pits. They are supposed to have come from Mars. Since the gravity on Earth is almost three times what it is on Mars, it takes the martians quite a while to figure out how to get out of these pits. At first they seem very sluggish and weighed down.<br /><br />  At some point in the story, the death machines come and destroy alot of things. They look like tripods. They are made of metal and can shoot a heatray that destroys anything that is in it's path, including humans.<br /><br />  Of course, like all stories, this one has a happy ending. All of the Martians die because they are not immune to the bacteria and disease that inhabits our Earth and everyone is safe.	2005-10-08

How do I describe this book without giving it away? Let me try: A simple man, a commoner, a hard worker doesn't have much in life, nor does he ask much from life. His days are always the same, working at the amusement park, fixing rides and sharing a brief conversation with a child here and a child there. He is not your typical cute old man sitting on a park bench, but instead one who is covered in grease and intent on fixing any problem as soon as it arises, nothing is more important. Then he dies. He dies trying to save a girl caught under a broken roller coaster. Did he save her before he died? We don't know and neither does he as he walks along the path of his afterlife trying to find out what happened. He encounters many people in his afterlife. People he doesn't know or people he never expected to see again. He doesn't understand why they would be in heaven, what significance they play in his life and death. He learns, though. He learns about his mistakes, he learns about mistakes others made with him. \\"Mistakes\\" he always thought were on purpose. He learns about consequences and patterns, the reaction of an action, so to speak.  <br /> <br />Will he see his beloved wife ever again? Will she be the same? Will she want to be in his heaven? Did he save the girl under the roller coaster? Eddie harbors guilt, and he will not be able to leave peacefully until he finds out what it is, where it came from, and how he can let it go. The answers are in the book and they are insightful and beautiful.  <br /> <br />This book shows a different \\"take\\" on heaven. It is not a particularly religious or spiritual book. It is about emotions that are carried with you forever, even into the afterlife. Emotions seized and emotions that must be overcome in order to find peace and \\"live\\" forever. I love this book. None of the five people that Eddie met were people I thought he would meet. The \\"heaven\\" in this book is just like what I have imagined heaven to be like, different for every individual, a compelation of everything beautiful and comfortable that happened in his/or her life. The heaven reminded me a little of the heaven in What Dreams May Come by Richard Matteson. The devotion, dedication, and the simplicities of the character reminded me a lot of the characters in Michele Geraldi's book Calling in the Night. I hope people will read The Five People You Meet in Heaven because it is a touching story in itself and then it also makes you think and wonder and dream...about heaven. And what could be more worthy of a dream than that?	2005-10-08

Fortunately, she has one possibility already lined up.  The city of Clovis wants to increase their tourism revenue and is looking for a PR consultant to help them do that.  As an added bonus, she'll get to spend time with one of her best friends, Mae King, a local dairy farmer.<br /><br />Mae is acting weird, however.  When Sasha finally gets Mae to open up, Mae reveals two secrets.  First, aliens have regularly kidnapped her.  Second, there's a dead body on her land, and she doesn't really want to call the police for fear they'll arrest her.<br /><br />Sasha isn't keen on the idea of keeping the secret and calls the police the first chance she gets.  After she does, she realizes Mae's fears were justified as she seems to be the only suspect the police want to talk about.  Mae's daughter isn't helping matters any by sticking her nose into the two's friendship.<br /><br />Meanwhile, at her interview with the Chamber of Commerce, Sasha learns they want her to come up with a PR plan to put them on the map and greatly increase their tourism revenue.  And they hint that the aliens in the area really just might be the way to go.  She's got just one week to come up with a plan to present to find out if she'll get the job.<br /><br />The book starts out all over the place, with talk of Sasha's hallucinations and a visit with her mom.  I was beginning to wonder if the praise I'd heard for the book was well founded or not, but then Sasha arrived in Clovis.  It's really not too far in, but from that point on, the plot picks up and the book becomes quite interesting.  There are several red herrings that distract for a while, but the solution is a little obvious before the end.  Even so, the author does a good job of keeping the reader entertained with quirky and sinister characters.  The writing style is quite fun as well.  There are long passages of dialog at times, and every so often, the author uses a cleaver turn of phrase that makes you stop and reread the passage to fully enjoy it.<br /><br />The couple of flaws are worth mentioning, but hardly detract from the overall enjoyment.  It's a quirky cozy that will leave the reader ready for Sasha's next case.at times, and every so often, the author uses a cleaver turn of phrase that makes you stop and reread the passage to fully enjoy it. <br /> <br />The couple of flaws are worth mentioning, but hardly detract from the overall enjoyment.

The Merchant of Death is the 1st book in the epic series of the adventures of Bobby Pendragon. Bobby is a normal, fourteen year-old kid, who was taken against his will by his uncle to become a *Traveler*. Now, this book starts off when Bobby is caught by his uncle kissing his girlfriend and they go off to a subway station in the Bronx, where they flume to Denduron. This is the beginning of a great adventure with Bobby, his Uncle Press, and much more. <br /> <br />Bobby is a brave kid, especially since he is taken away from his family for many months, even a year. Any kid would have been scared to tears if this had happened. Not Bobby. He stays brave and is caught in the eye of death many times throughout the course of the book. Bobby is also amazing because in nearly every page of the book, he seems to make a joke. D.J Machale takes you through man-eating quigs, deadly knights, and furious miners. <br /> <br />This book is not all just adventure. In fact, half the book is Bobby's adventures, and the other half is describing how his friends cope (while reading his stories) on his home planet.

I was able to make a personal connection to the text because I too was a young girl who was impoverished at the time. I knew what it felt like to be cold and hungry and I related immediately to the main character.     I came away from reading this book with empathy, sympathy, and knowing the truth: Not everyone has been blessed with having their basic needs met. In addition, I experienced a great joy when her grandmother takes her up to heaven to a better comforting place.    I came away with the concept that death was not something to be feared or a bad thing, but something that might be comforting and  positive. I have always loved this book. Because even as a child who was struggling I too had many things to be thankful for in comparison to what the little match girl had. The underlying message is powerful and real.	2005-10-08

I can't really think of anything I didn't like about the book, I just wish there was more.  I will definitely read Aaron's next book.  IF you haven't read Half Life you most definitely should.

Unlike Herbert/Anderson's previous \\"Dune\\" trilogy, this time around the second book is not only as good as the first, it's quite a bit better.  Sadly, the main problem from \\"the Butlerian Jihad\\" is held over: Herbert/Anderson BADLY need a competent editor.  There are so many badly written sentences (and a few out-and-out grammatical errors) that it became distracting. <br /> <br />Luckily, the plot is sufficiently good to keep me from being distracted for long.  Once again, I can't honestly say that it meshes up perfectly with Frank Herbert's work, but on its own, this is a pretty gripping sci-fi epic, with memorable characters (I'm particularly fond of Erasmus, one of the better villains I've read in a while) and a satisfying ambition. <br /> <br />Maybe future editions can clean up some of the sloppy prose and correct some of the errors.  It's a shame for a fundamentally good work to be marred by material that is entirely fixable.	2005-10-08

That's about the only new twist here and that's where the hi-jinx begin. As in other Barrington books there is the usual label-dropping of fine wines and clothing and meals in only the finest restaurants. There are the obligatory brief but spicy bedroom scenes. Dino, Stone's NYPD buddy, makes the trans-Atlantic trip to help straighten things out. And of course, the on-going soap opera involving Stone's ex-girlfriends continues with the British ex taking center stage. (Stone's NYC/LA ex makes a brief appearance and then leaves in a huff.) The mystery, although no brain teaser, is enough to keep the reader entertained. If this sounds like a negative review it's not - Stone Barrington books deliver as promised. No heavy lifting here. No philosophical endeavors into the human condition. No solving of world problems. They are simply mildly entertaining quick reads and are perfect for reading in crowded loud airports, beside the pool or during rain delays at baseball games.	2005-10-08

Of course, the reality was that those highly government-steered economies faced 10 years of downturn and recession from 1992, while the U.S. boomed. Now we have this new book which states basically the same thing, even though if you look at the list of the most competitive countries, you see the ones without a strong industrial policy at the top (Finland, USA, Holland, Switzerland, New Zealand, Britain, etc.). Japan, far from being a booming economy, has been stuck in stagnation for over 10 years. Germany has become more efficient in spite of, not because of its government. Does the author really believe that the German state makes the German economy more competitive ?? One key point in this book is the idea that state-steered Airbus is beating Boeing, because it has more orders (the book as written in January, 2005). Yet, I was just in Germany this past week (October 2005), and read an article in the German press on how Boeing has more orders, and is overtaking Airbus. So does this now make the author's claims that the Europeans are beating the U.S. in this \\"key industry\\" meaningless ? I would suggest, it does. In addition, that same article discussed the cultural conflicts at Airbus (French vs. German managers, etc.). That seems hardly an competitive advantage vis-a-vis Boeing. The truth is that the U.S. got competitive in the 1990s because: a. Wallmart spurred massive savings by its innovations and cost-cutting, which spread throughout the U.S. economy, b. dot.coms located around the private university Stanford thrived, c. the Reagan Revolution had cut government involvement in industry, and freed up the economy. In contrast, Europe has been held down by the German and French interventionist states (the truth is, Europe IS strong, as this book suggests, but it would be much more successful if the state cut costs, taxes, and bureaucracy). The same is true of Japan and China. Mao and the communists prevented the \\"Chinese boom\\" in the period 1945-1980. It has only been deregulation and allowing capitalism in that has freed up the Chinese economy. It was not \\"state planning\\". This book is basically a rehash of books like Robert Reich's \\"The Work of Nations\\" from the early 1990s, which argued that nations compete against each other. Reich's book was largely refuted, and I think this book can be too. The truth is, Germany is not competing with the U.S. and Japan. We have individual companies, funded by international shareholders and funds, operating across the world. The idea of \\"national industries\\" is just a dead idea. In science, the U.S. continues to lead the world. I live in Dallas, Texas, and many of the top German and French researchers live in this highly unregulated Texas, even though they could be living and working in the \\"state-steered\\" scientific environments of Paris and Munich. There is a reason for that. Indeed the author of this book mentions the 400,000 European technology workers and scientists working in the U.S. My question is, if the \\"environment\\" in Europe is so great, why are they here ? Nobel prizes were awarded last week, and there was a two to one ratio of Americans to Europeans. Thus, our \\"scientific environment\\" is not so bad in the U.S. I found this book interesting as a thought-provoker, but in reality, I think that most of the theses in the book have been refuted (the exception would be the U.S. dollar, which will fall, as the author states, and the fact that yes, the current U.S. boom is largely funded by individual U.S. consumers going into debt, so it is \\"debt-funded growth\\"). But I still think that when we here buy a Lexus, and send dollars to Japan, we get the better deal, because it adds more to my life to drive a nice Lexus around, than it adds to the Japanese lifestyle, to have T-notes in a bank vault in Tokyo. The idea that only exports count, not imports, is a neo-mercantilist idea. If exports over imports equal wealth, why aren't the mineral-exporting African countries rich ? Why are countries like Singapore and Switzerland, which do banking and services, rich ? The author also seems to think that only manufacturing counts, not services. The \\"Economist\\" magazine criticized that idea, saying, just because you can \\"drop the product on your foot\\" doesn't mean it is a good product. The truth is, manufacturing is not important for a country, and \\"key industries\\" also aren't. What counts is productivity. If you have productivity and can sell something that someone will pay for, you can be wealthy. Also, the author doesn't mention that the U.S. economy is 80 % internal. It is an \\"inner market\\", so only 20 % of our economy is subject to export-import. Of course, for countries like Japan and Germany, exporting is critical to survival. For the U.S., much less so. That is one reason Americans don't care that much if the dollar falls, whereas the Germans treat the rise and fall of the euro as absolutely life-threatening.	2005-10-08

Why no one ever goes to a philosopher for advice? <br />2.  Why one mother had this to say about her son the philosopher: \\"He's the kind of doctor who can't help anyone.\\"? <br /> <br />If you're curious about it, simply read the first chapter of this book.  Once you have discovered.what we have lost, you will be encouraged to read the rest of the book. <br /> <br />\\"In the beginning Reality was at once being, knowledge and bliss ...\\" began the the first sentence of the book.  For the purposes of this exceedingly short review, that phrase will be truncated to: \\"being and knowledge were one\\", on the theory that once you have those two the third will follow.  The important part about all three qualities is that they constituted the sacred.  But that was a long time ago in the era of the \\"primordial religion\\", long before even the first ancient texts of the Vedic scriptures were written.  The wisdom of that religion however persisted in the lineage of Pythagoras -- Socrates -- Plato -- Plotinus, and even survived intact for the few centuries after them. <br /> <br />The author details how Western Civilization gradually lost touch with the wisdom of the ages.  In the beginning, all knowledge was sacred, as well as art, music, dancing, and the crafts.  The beginning of the decline of philosophy from its pristine wisdom to pure rationalism started with the famous -- or infamous -- enunciation : <br /> <br />\\"Cogito ergo sum,\\" of Descartes, \\"I think, therefore I am.\\", entirely ignoring being.  Anyway, modern philosophy was born.  After that, we were treated to many \\"-isms\\", from nominalism to existentialism.  And, of course, Sartre and his book: \\"Being and Nothingness\\".  That was the final decree.  Being and knowledge were officially divorced. <br /> <br />Fortunately however, there has been a rediscovery of the traditional wisdom, the two most notable names in this rediscovery being Guenon and Schuon.  This book details that rediscovery and shows how not only is all knowledge sacred but how the arts and sciences are fountains of Grace.   <br /> <br />This is not easy reading.  However, it will interest and repay the reader with an interest in tradition as defined by Schuon.  All of the ills of the modern world, global warming, overpopulation of the globe, nuclear weapons, etc., etc., etc. can be traced to the decline of traditional wisdom.	2005-10-08

It discusses the many kinds of etching, including lift and aquatint processes, up to relief etching. Soft ground gets more attention here than most authors give it, including various aspects of using paper as a tool to transfer or create an image. Chamberlain also covers the techniques where the toolmarks create the image directly: engraving, drypoint, crivee, and collage-like \\"metal graphic.\\" Mezzotint, so unlike the other processes, gets separate discussion of its own. Chamberlain is especially helpful in offering alternatives to the laborious rocker ground, including aquatint and abrasive techniques.<br /><br />Later chapters address the basics of paper, ink, and press. Of course, there's that moment when all the pieces come together and print is pulled. Then, discuss covers some of the techniques and problems of drying the finished print - preserving the embossing that comes from intaglio process, while avoiding the cockling that carelessly dried paper is subject to.<br /><br />This won't stand by itself as a how-to guide for a beginning engraver or etcher. It is helpful, though, in summarizing the many ways to make marks on the plate, including some unusual transfer techniques. This helps the print-lover as well. I find myself intriuged by the marks in an image as much as by the image itself. Knowing the means used to convert the artist's imagination into reality only heightens my enjoyment. No book on intaglio process covers everything, but this book certainly carries its weight in describing both common and unusual techniques. I recommend it highly.<br /><br />//wiredweird	2005-10-08

It takes place in the fascinating world of Neopolis, a city populated entirely by people with extraordinary superpowers.  The characters are the police force that keeps the whole city from spinning out of control, and Top Ten is the story of how they convict the guilty, protect the innocent (or the mostly innocent anyway), and expose corruption up to the highest level.  It's a great story.  Alan Moore cleverly and insightfully portrays the city's social issues, such as an unfair prejudice against robots, and problems of disease and prostitution.  He uses the medium of the graphic novel to its fullest extent in order to get his points across.  The art perfectly complements the story.  <br />He also creates a great deal of sympathy for his characters.  Every character, no matter how briefly they appear, has a personality, makes choices, and experiences the repurcussions of his or her actions.   <br />Also, the women in Top Ten are actually interesting and thoughtful characters, in contast to the plethoras of scantily-clad, one-dimensional, comic book superheroines in other comics.  Characters like Toy Box, Girl 1, and Irma Geddon are complex, and they contribute to the story not just by being part of the plot, but also by simply having interesting personalities. <br />Alan Moore's superpower is obviously to write amazing comic books.  Top Ten is something any reader can enjoy, not just hard core comic fans.	2005-10-08

Her writing brims with an excess of pathos, as if she suffered greatly- and in fact, she was a privileged member of the society she writes about and did not suffer at all- unless you believe that her university's refusal to accept her resignation, rendered in protest, is suffering- she was not forced to work, they simply did not accept her letter of resignation as final. Poor thing. Her writing style is so over the top that I could not bear to finish this book and while I have a great empathy, compassion, and interest in this region and the plight of women in particular, this book does these a disservice. Try \\"The Bookseller of Kabul\\" for a well written and topical read. But spare yourself from the hubris and pompous writings of this english professor. She likes and admires herself so much that you do not need to like her as well. As a side note, it is difficult at best to imagine how reading Lolita could possibly strengthen these women, with the exception that it was a banned book and thus they were thumbing their noses at the laws of the land. The association between Lolita the character and the women reading the book made by the author is ludicrous.	2005-10-08

From the first page, Kinsella's narration will send you in spirals of laughter, (so maybe not best read on the tram!!) moving fluidly from her shopaholic series Kinsella takes on Emma's british, Bridget Jones-esque character to perfection.<br /><br />It starts off on a plane and during some turbulence she finds herself confiding her life secrets from clothing size (she really thought she was going to die to have to part with that!) to problems with her boyfriend and losing her virginity.<br /><br />The next day, striding into work (worst possible nightmare ever) the CEO of her company turns out to be Jack Harper, the very man she had clung to on the plane ride and confided her deepest darkest secrets to...including how she wags work to get a longer lunch hour and what she really thinks of her co-workers and the office's coffee machine!!<br /><br />There are never any dull moments in this fast packed and endearing novel, which although a bit unrealistic, we can, at times empathasize with our (size 8 I swear!!) heroine as we realize that she is but a complex charade of stereotypes.<br /><br />Now the question is: Can HE keep a secret?	2005-10-08

Abraham Lincoln is revered by lawyers everywhere for his courtroom skills and practical wisdom. The Lincoln Michael Connelly refers is not Abraham, but rather the automobile.<br /><br />Mickey Haller, son of an original Los Angeles superstar lawyer, owns several. At times the limousine business seems preferable to his own. But finally he gets, to his eternal regret the \\"franchise case\\", the kind of case that not only pays the bills but causes other clients to want his services.<br /><br />A young rich real estate broker is charged in the attempted murder of a hooker. His insistence in his innocence causes Haller to realize he may have what he has always dreaded, the actually innocent client. But he finds his defense efforts in disarray as the case sours, and he himself becomes a murder suspect.<br /><br />Non-lawyers usually do not write good legal thrillers. Michael Connelly, a former reporter and America's best mystery writer, is the exception that proves the rule. He has a great ear for the courtroom and a sense of the professional and economic dilemmas trial lawyers face.<br /><br />I will say this, however, in real life no matter how secret the client confidence, lawyers are ethically able to access the expertise necessary to know how to respond to any dilemma in an ethically sound way. The real Mickey Haller would have picked up the phone to the Bar's hotline for an ethics opinion. That simple act would have destroyed a helluva tale.<br /><br />I hope we will see more of Haller. He has his demons but he is not as dark a protagonist as Harry Bosch. The reality is, in his first legal thriller, Connelly has produced a book every bit as good as John Grisham's A Time To Kill. That is saying a lot.	2005-10-08

Well, perhaps any type of successful regulation.  Books on regulatory failure are much easier to come by.   And this book had such a promising setting.  The claim: A single catastrophic accident at any one US nuclear plant would have ruinous consequences for the entire industry.  Each licencee is a hostage of every other licencee.  Safety pays!  Result: the nuclear industry has founded the INPO organization, to police uniform high safety standards, simply to protect industry's huge investment in nuclear power.   <br /> <br />Rees' basic hypothesis is that nuclear power plants operate on some sort of Enlightened Self Interest (ESI).  This assumption on rationality is never explicitly stated however, nor is it examined critically.  But Rees argues from industry sources that  nuclear plants strive to be safe, they compete with each other to be the safest, and that the nuclear industry provide INPO with muscle to make life difficult for those who either cannot or will not do so. <br /> <br />Surprisingly, many of Rees' examples have kind of a dualism.  On the one hand, Rees' examples tell a story on how the Three Mile Island accident resulted in soul searching and catharsis, how the transformaton has resulted in increased industry responsibility, how new controls have been set up, and how INPO succesfully fulfills its policing role.  But many of the examples could equally well be interpreted the other way around:   <br />- that INPO has been given only weak powers - the so-called Management by Embarassment in closed industry fora. Not stong ones; because linking INPO evaluations and insurance cost, for instance, can affect stock price enormously (p94) <br />- that INPO is extremely cautious not to alienate its sponsor base (p145) <br />- that the \\"safety pays\\" notion is not widely shared across industry, to say the least, and that cost-cutting on safetyis widespread  <br />- that the wake-up call from Three-Mile Island is not received by all actors <br /> <br />For instance, take the example of the INPO crack-down in 1987 - eight years after TMI (!) - on a plant where all operators had fallen asleep on several occasions, leaving operating reactors unattended.  Is this an example of a more fundamental free-rider problem in the industry and an opportunity to re-examine the rational ESI assumption ?- or is it an example of succesful INPO peer-pressure intervention?  Rees only considers the latter. <br /> <br />It is a mystery to me why Rees has not exploited this alternative line of interpretation and the reason why I find the analysis disappointing.   <br />Rees demonstrates that self-regulation can improve the safety of some plants, likely in ways that public regulation cannot achieve and possibly in a more efficient manner.  But the analysis fails to demonstrate that self-regulation can replace public regulation, which is surprising, bearing in mind the \\"hostages of each other\\" setting of the analysis. <br />	2005-10-08

The easy flow of Abby's sunny sarcasm, her smoothing of the satiric-edge trademark of Magdelana Yoder gave me a cozier live in, in Tamar Meyers's DEN OF ANTIQUITY series than I experienced in the Pen Dutch literary gourmet style, though both series are awesome in their humorous capture of human foibles at their least and most sublime.  What a writer!<br /><br />The mansions, restaurants, coffee or tea breaks, and munching while clueing all served to keep me reading onward, happy as a clam.  I quickly and contentedly sliped into reading along with a relaxed writer/artist who obviously has fun with her craft as she's creating.<br /><br />Considering the flow of this novel in retrospect, I'm intrigued that I recall no feeling of author angst or effort underlying the movement of plot, fleshing of characters, click of dialogue, or lay out of descriptions.  Maybe Tamar's unusual background could expalin her obvious confidence in her work and its process:<br /><br />She grew up in the Belgian Congo as a member of a missionary family, passed a childhood in that conflict-rich environment with religious upbringing, returned as a teen to the USA by force of cultural growing pains in the Congo, met her husband-to-be the first day at a US school, accomplished a MA in English, then worked 23 years to launch her two currently successful series.  What a perfect background for evolving into a literary pundit.<br /><br />I believe what I enjoy most about this series is the various routinely-natural and effortlessly-entertaining ways Abby worries out her mystery and interviews suspects, often over a meal in a luxury setting or at least one with rich aromatic ambiance of one intensity or another.  Hey.  I'm a culinary cozy addict.  I couldn't ask for more.<br /><br />Here are a couple of my favorite Abby clue-strewing scenes:<br /><br />Bubble bath contemplations with her cat batting bubbles ...<br /><br />Ex husbands' current wife gives Abby a makeover as the current \\"homemaker\\" moans over now being the other woman, while Abby soothes the angst of her exhusband's wife with whom he cheated on Abby ...  Yeah.  And the scene works with both irony and warmth!<br /><br />That's all great setting and satire, but this might take the cake:<br /><br />>> \\"I really need to smoke while I eat,\\" she (woman Abby was \\"grilling\\") said.  To be truthful, she didn't sound nasty about it at all.  Merely desperate.<br /><br />>> \\"I'm sure you'll find enough second-hand smoke to fill your dietary needs,\\" I (Abby) said kindly.<br /><br />>> She looked genuinely torn between lunch with me and a solitary pack of coffin nails.<br /><br />>> \\"Okay, you can smoke, but blow that nasty stuff away from my plate.  I mean, you wouldn't like it if I farted on your food, would you?\\" &lt;&lt;<br /><br />This was quite descriptively good as well:<br /><br />>>I exhaled loudly, for all the world sounding like a punctured tire.&lt;&lt;<br /><br />The humor in this author effervesces so easily there's probably quite a bit of it which slides right by, making second and third reading a rewarding venture.  Whatever Myers offers you can bet on its being uniquely complex, edgy and hilarious, intriguing and natural in a funny, off-beat way.<br /><br />Of course Abby's excursions & exchanges with the gay Rob & Bob are delightfully warm & funny, and the gutsy gourmet meals Bob concocts which Rob & Abby beg to avoid are interestingly mouth watering ... from a distance.<br /><br />Really enjoyed the way Abby dealt with her approach/avoidance conflict (romancing ever-after Vs dragging feet) as her relationship with trained police investigator Greg Washburn grows more intimate and skidds toward commitment.<br /><br />This is a work of sheer and simple entertainment with a backwash of stereotypes squashed and genuine relating relished.  Lots of hilarious mix & mismatch is stirred effervescently into the kettles of cuisine, means of marriage, ways of mystery, and action-packed menageries.<br /><br/>Take it.  You won't leave it for long.<br /><br />Excellent storytelling and wordsmithing, Tamar!  You prove the blessing and richness of your talent with every breath and every keystroke.

The painting's focal point is not Christ, but the devil.  The devil wears no horns nor sports a pointed tail; he is attractive and extremely alluring.  This seemingly benign appeal, Daniel discovers augurs the spell the city has yet to cast upon him,  adequately mirrors the human avarice of all the novel's players and offers a bit of a biblical metaphor for the events of this partial police procedural/battle between good and evil.<br /><br />From the moment he arrives to catalogue the library of the ancient Scacchi family he is surrounded by its eclectic members entrenched in their own whacky sophistication-a sophistication  that camouflages needs and desires that are as corrupt and beautiful as any old palazzo crumbling into the Grand canal, When he finds the manuscript of a brilliant violin concerto written during the time of the maestro Vivaldi, he suddenly knows what it is like to be Tintoretto's Christ and to mistakenly turn the devil's stones into bread.. When his employer asks him to buy a priceless black market violin, and pretend that he is the author of the found manuscript, Daniel feels he is about to fling himself off that temple wall and prays that the foretold angels will  break his fall.  Ultimately, Daniel sees the devil for what he is, and instead of accepting the wealth of all the kingdoms of the world, he saves his own soul and the souls of a two beautiful women seduced by the magic of the violin concerto and the world of power and music that brings such beauty to the life in an otherwise corrupt world..<br /><br />Juxtaposed with Daniel's story are the letters of 19th century Lorenzo Scacchi, another tempted Christ  who knows first-hand the secret of the violin concerto, the mysterious violin and the lovely Jewess caught in a web of intolerance where her genius must go unrecognized and her spirit remain trapped forever in both a real and metaphysical ghetto.<br /><br />As Daniel becomes more aware of his role in this ancient drama and emerges triumphant to conquer his devil, Lorenzo reveals his own very human desires, and succumbs to that which he fears the most.<br /><br />Hewson does a wonderful job of recreating that mystery of corrupt sophistication that so intrigue all visitors to La Serenissima.  His descriptions of the Jewish ghetto and the worldy resignation of its inhabitants horrify almost as much as his denouement of both characters and the woman in their lives thrills.unrecognized and her spirit remain trapped forever in both a real and metaphysical ghetto.   <br /> <br />As Daniel becomes more aware of his role in this ancient drama and emerges triumphant to conquer his devil, Lorenzo reveals his own very human desires, and succumbs to that which he fears the most. <br /> <br />Hewson does a wonderful job of recreating that mystery of corrupt sophistication that so intrigue all visitors to La Serenissima.

For it will come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth. Be always on the watch, and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen, and that you may be able to stand before the Son of Man.<br /><br />Accusing someone is a serious thing to do, not to be handled lightly, not for the immature, and not to be done without the prompting of the Holy Spirit. In scripture it was handled by the Apostles, by seasoned men and women of God. But even the disciples, as show in the Gospels, misjudged people (Mark 9:38). When you accuse another person without the prompting of the Holy Spirit, you'll be in danger of the trap of the enemy, who greatest weapon is using Christian to accuse other Christians, and cause division. Many times, in the name of \\"defending the truth\\", we are often serving the devil.<br />Take a strong warning from Philip Elston, who had a vision several years ago in which he saw the Lord standing with His arms outstretched.

I found this story line to be interesting - a woman starting over after the death of her beloved husband.  While there are some great analogies in the book, overall it is a huge disappointment!   It is hard to believe that relationships from college are just picked up where they left off while all her friends admit that she just exited their lives years ago!  It would have been more realistic if time was taken to renew the relationships. Plus, the other characters in the book seemed a bit unreal as well.  If only life was that sugary... <br />I am an optimistic person, but this story just seemed to good to be true.  It is a shame because I usually love this author's work.  It does not portray the real feelings felt by a widow.  I have a friend who felt very alone after her husband died.

In 1951,Senator Joseph R. McCarthy made a lengthy speech(constantly interrupted)in the Senate,highly critical of the military and diplomatic career of General George C. Marshall(and other \\"public servants\\")during the Roosevelt and Truman administrations.The reaction from many quarters to this speech was one of indignant outrage.<br /><br />In questioning the wisdom-indeed the very loyalty to the US-of Marshall,revered and  sanctified as the \\"Organizer of victory\\" during World War 2,even Senator McCarthy's allies(such as Republican party chief Robert Taft),felt Joe may have gone too far.<br /><br />To this day,it is McCarthy's \\"attack\\" on Marshall-Army chief,roving diplomat for Truman,Secretary of State and Defence Secretary-which is pointed to as being the \\"red-hunting\\" Senator's greatest political crime.This book,published in 1951,is basically a condensed version of McCarthy's speech,with some additional material.<br /><br />Whether McCarthy was wholly responsible for writing the speech/book-or if,as some believe,it is largely the work of one of his more academic assistants,such as J.B. Matthews,is debatable.<br /><br />Be that as it may,whoever has(like me)been informed by our \\"media\\" for decades that McCarthy's public attack on Marshall was a prime example of Joe's unholy wickedness,may have to revise their opinion after reading this book.The case made against Marshall,his proteges and advisors,is carefully argued,well supported by evidence-and devastating!Drawing on published memoirs by the politicians,military figures and such who were involved in the momentous events in which Marshall played a leading part,one is staggered by the scope of the indictment against him,and sobered by the thought of the other horrors which would have occured if Marshall(and others discussed here)had managed to get their way all the time(instead of just a lot of the time!).<br /><br />Here we see Marshall's murky role in the Japan/Pearl harbour debacle,his monomania about opening a \\"Second front\\"-at a time when neither the US or the Britain could have mounted an assault on Nazi held Western Europe without colossal casualties and inevitable failure,solely to take the pressure off Stalin's forces in Russia(Stalin having been until very recently Hitler's ally and fellow plunderer of Europe);his sabotaging of the efforts of Churchill and others who were trying to prevent Russia occupying swathes of eastern europe and taking Berlin;his moves to see that Russia was brought into the war in the east(a strengthening of Stalin's hand quite unnecessary to the Allied war on Japan);his insistence on there being a land invasion of Japan(then defeated militarily,without supplies-as its Navy had gone-and suing for peace with the Allies)which would have seen massive needless loss of life among Allied servicemen;his role in ensuring Stalin got the territory he craved during behind the scenes manoevering at the big conferences like Tehran and Yalta;his willingness to forward the cause of Mao and his communist rebels at the expense of the Nationalist regime which led to decades of the Chairman's gory incompetent rule over China(turning it into an impoverished charnel house).<br /><br />  Anyone reading the indictment here will probably begin to wonder how on earth Marshall gained such a reputation as a sagacious guardian of the US and the free world's interests,and why he was thought of so highly by clever political operators like FDR,Truman and Eisenhower.Is this the story of a naive serial blunderer,whose errors were somehow turned into epics of reasoned statesmanship by a fawning gullible left/liberal media and political establishment-or were all these activities(which promoted the aims and ends of Stalin)coldly calculated and deliberate.We have the evidence from the previously secret US and Soviet intelligence archives that the infiltration into the power structure of the US by Soviet agents and fellow travelling allies was on a quite breathtaking scale in the 30's and 40's.Much more still remains locked in the archives of the Soviet intelligence services.There is uncontrovertable evidence that many of those previously declared by the \\"liberal consensus\\" to have been innocent victims of unscrupulous political witch hunters like McCarthy and the Un-American Activities Committee-from Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White to the Rosenbergs-were in fact guilty as charged all along.Joe McCarthy came close to calling Marshall a traitor.Dwight Eisenhower,who coasted to prominence on Marshall's coat-tails,never forgave McCarthy for attacking his old mentor-it was one of the reasons why,as President,Ike finally joined the pack who were out to get the Junior Senator from Wisconsin,and helped destroy him politically during the 1954 Army Hearings and their aftermath.<br /><br />Reading this book will help any impartial reader decide who was right about George Catlett Marshall.l remains locked in the archives of the Soviet intelligence services.There is uncontrovertable evidence that many of those previously declared by the \\"liberal consensus\\" to have been innocent victims of unscrupulous political witch hunters like McCarthy and the Un-American Activities Committee-from Alger Hiss and Harry Dexter White to the Rosenbergs-were in fact guilty as charged all along.Joe McCarthy came close to calling Marshall a traitor.Dwight Eisenhower,who coasted to prominence on Marshall's coat-tails,never forgave McCarthy for attacking his old mentor-it was one of the reasons why,as President,Ike finally joined the pack who were out to get the Junior Senator from Wisconsin,and helped destroy him politically during the 1954 Army Hearings and their aftermath. <br />Reading this book will help any impartial reader decide who was right about George Catlett Marshall.	2005-10-08

The triple alliance was formed by Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy aided by the sick man of Europe, the Ottoman empire. The Allies was formed of the French British and Russians. <br /> <br />The German desire for dominance with Austria's vacillation exacerbated by a lack of diplomatic infrastructure led to mobilization. <br /> <br />The exuberance of patriotism was soon to be replaced by the doleful laments of despair and the checked hopes of a decisive victory. <br /> <br />Within one year the Western front was scarred by a network of trenches pervaded only by the interminable ennui of trench warfare. <br /> <br />That year saw the collapse of the Austrians on the Eastern Front balanced by the victory of the Germans at Gorlice-Tarnow against the Tsar's armies. The Austrians were eventually buttressed by the Germans averting a Russian invasion. <br /> <br />Smaller fronts presented themselves in the German colonies in Africa and the middle east governed by the Ottoman Caliphate. The former were occupied to no great effect and the latter repelled an invasion which did little to deter another. <br /> <br />1916 saw the Jutland and the Somme which the author brings to life with photo and words alike. <br /> <br />By 1917 both France and Russia were experiencing inflation, food shortages and insurrection. The french patriotism waned clenching desperately to an empheral sense of the homeland thus refusing to attack but agreeing to defend. The Russian situation was ripe for the Bolshevik revolution whichamputated a dying limb of the Allied force later replaced by the arms of America. <br /> <br />The Americans entered the war spurred by the German U boat campaign and interference with Mexican American affairs. <br /> <br />1918 saw the collapse of the house of Hollenzorn, Hapsburgs and Ottomans. <br /> <br />The author's penchant for description is delightfully balanced by his analytical prowess giving the reader an incomparable understanding of this apocalyptic event. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-08

The thought that a point of \\"arrival\\" is achieved is a myth.  The inner and outer conflict of the human journey doesn't work together to create evolutionary leaps, but a seeming digression, a loss of our humanity, a lessening of our humanity.  \\"The outer man perishes\\" is the way St. Paul put it.  Life isn't a process made to perfect, but to humble.<br /><br />During the confirmation process of Chief Justice John Roberts one of the arguments I read made against his confirmation wasn't the fact that he had made egregious blunders that would work against him, but, rather he hadn't made any mistakes.  He wasn't marred enough.  He was too perfect.  That is an impossibility.<br /><br />Byzantium is an historical novel about the journeys of an Irish monk from the 9th century named Aidan.  Not based on the actual life of one person, it's an amalgamation of the type of adventures pilgrims would endure around this time.<br /><br />The story begins when he is chosen, along with two others from their monastery, to deliver a hand written book to the emperor, Basil I, of the Holy Roman Empire.<br /><br />Before the pilgrim party leaves Aidan has a dream which he interprets to be a vision of his impending death upon reaching Byzantium.  This vision drives Aidan's interpretation of events and relationship with God.<br /><br />When Aidan reaches Byzantium (apart from his fellow monks) and leaves Byzantium with his life intact, he assumes God has abandoned him.  Through the bulk of the book a slow erosion of Aidan's faith is seen.  It's probably the erosion that happens in the lives of many who start out in steps of faith and end up way off course.  It's the daily veering (just a degree) imperceptible to the eye, though noticeable in the heart.<br /><br />A sub-story is between Aidan and a Viking raider named Gunnar.  The ironic interplay is how similar events have opposite effect upon the two.  In God's upside-down kingdom, a pillaging pagan provides Christ's example to the monastic-made man.<br /><br />IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THIS BOOK AND EVER WANT TO READ THIS BOOK SKIP DOWN TO THE LAST PARAGRAPH SO I DON'T RUIN THE STORY.<br /><br />There were so many layers of this story which I enjoyed.  The balance between Aidan's own choices and divine intervention.  Aidan's and his companion's suffering moved me and put into perspective my troubles.  The insight into other people.  Personalities from many nationalities are developed: Celtic, Dane, Byzantine, Arab.  The common humanity we all share surfaces, though, despite cultural idiosyncrasies.<br /><br />The moral of the story, so to speak, is the redemption God works for the pillaging Vikings and the rededication that takes place in Aidan's life.  This comes to a head after Aidan has returned from the pilgrimage and been back at the monastery for a short time and has decided to leave the priesthood.  It's at this point that the Vikings return to entreat Aidan to return to their land and teach them of the \\"hanging god,\\" Jesu.  This sparks another vision parallel to his first vision of death in Byzantium.  As Aidan comes out of his vision-trance, and in Job 38 fashion, he enters into this soliloquy:<br /><br />  \\"Everyone dies, Gunnar had said.  All flesh is grass, said Cadoc.  What did  you expect, Aidan?<br /><br />  \\"Did you really think that Christ would blunt the spear points, deflect the  lash, cause the chains to melt away when they touched your skin?  Did you ex- pect to walk in sunlight and not feel the heat, or to go without water and not<br />  grow thirsty?  Did you think that all the hatred would turn to brotherly love the<br />  moment you strode into view?  Did you think both storms and tempers would<br />  calm because of the tonsure on your head?<br /><br />  \\"Did you believe God would shield you forever from the hurt and pain of  this sin-riven world?  That you would be spared the injustice and strife others  were forced to endure?That disease would no longer afflict you, that you<br />  would live forever untouched by the tribulations of common humanity?\\"<br /><br />I think this way at times.  I'm shocked by trouble.  I sink into a downward spiral when my feelings don't match my sunshine outlook.  How vain, how foolish.<br /><br />Now, the questions end and the admonition begins:<br /><br /> \\"Fool!  All these things Christ suffered, and more.  Aidan, you have been blind.  You have beheld the truth, stared long upon it, yet failed to perceive so much<br />  as the smallest glimpse of all that was shown you.  Sure, this is the heart of the<br />  great mystery: that God became man, shouldering the weight of suffering so<br />  that on the final day none could say, `Who are you to judge the world?  What do<br />  you know of injustice?  What do you know of torture, sickness, poverty?  How<br />  dare  you call yourself a righteous God!  What do you know of death?'<br /><br />  \\"He knows, Aidan, he knows!<br /><br />  \\"Gunnar, untutored barbarian that he was, had discerned this central truth,<br />  while I, for all my monkish learning, had forever failed to grasp it.  In Gunnar,<br />  this understanding had kindled hope and faith, even as my lack of<br />  understanding had brought me to hopelessness.\\"<br /><br />At this point Aidan renews his priestly vows and in the epilogue we're told in condensed form the ministry of Aidan's later life.<br /><br />This is a wonderful (literally wonder-full) journey of a person who loses them-self, but becomes in the process someone greater for good and for God.  It's about destiny, goodness, suffering, and redemption.

First of all it is not that long of a book.  But it takes a long time to read because you cannot breeze through it.  Written by a South African pastor in the 1800's, this book has a woodenness to the english that slows you down.  This is good because the topic is so deep that you want to stop and pray every page or two.<br /><br />It leveled me to the ground about 12 years ago.  It is still at the top of my list.<br /><br />As a pastor, I have recommended this book to many, many people.  It usually changes their lives.  The fruit tends to be enduring and deep.<br /><br />I first encountered it when I was a YWAM student.  It was required reading in our discipleship school.  I think this book should be read by every Christian.  If you don't have a copy, buy an extra one so that you can have a loaner.	2005-10-08

Complex emotions, strong secondary characters that further the plot, a well developed storyline, and outstanding dialogue, which added another level to the sexual tension in this book. There are so many wonderful layers. Moments that had me laughing out loud, tearing up and sighing. As for the heat between our hero and heroine... well, let's just say that you could use some ice cubes. The scenes are hot, creative and intense. Warning: There is a scene with a sex toy and some light bondage-more like a game between the couple than a lifestyle-so if you don't like some fantasy exploration with your sex, don't read this book. <br /> <br />Anyway Joanna's smart, funny and most importantly not afraid to stay one step ahead of her estranged husband and put him through his paces. While Lucas is an alpha hero who just tries to keep up and does so wonderfully, even managing to surprise Joanna every once in a while and to laugh at himself. I know I certainly wouldn't kick Lucas out of my bed, but it's his cousin Rigo that I'd love to have. (Ms. Fredrichs, please write Rigo's story!) <br /> <br />I did have the slight eyeroll at the big misunderstanding but I was surprised by how the final confrontation came together and I was cheering for Joanna as she kicked her adversary's butt (verbally). There is a high concentration on sex in this story-it's an Ellora's Cave book after all- but I enjoyed it! The story is about much more than just sex. It's about love, trust, miscommunication and the demons of doubt inside of us. Some of the issues presented had threads of real life issues, although the villain was still a little over the top. It was fun! <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed myself. This is the author's first novel and I'm hoping it won't be her last because I'm dying to know who she comes up with for Rigo. Please, please let Rigo's story be next. Oh, wait I said that already.	2005-10-08

His descriptions of the Afgan countryside are heartbreaking, but the converstions with those in the business of dyeing, weaving, and selling rugs are as affecting as they are informative. An old Turkmen saying conveys the essence of their rug tradition: \\"Carpets are our soul.\\" Or, as a young woman says as she completes knotting a section of the rug she is working on, \\"It is like a small world all alone and separate: perfect and peaceful.\\" Murphy explores the debates on authenticity: spontaneous folk art versus commercial product; synthetic dyes versus the natural dyes of the book's title. He does not shrink from showing us the enormous contrasts between the harsh life of the area and the poetic beauty of their rugs. In the end it is clear that he is an unabashed lover of Oriental rugs....and that's not a bad thing.  Highly recommended.	2005-10-08

Although his English is stiff, and perhaps colloquial to the locale where his style of English English was spoken (where he was raised or lived) and the 19th and 20th century periods in which he lived, it is still readable and understandable.<br />I found his tightly dissected views of how the (young person's) mind starts to perceive objects and to draw them, and how early artists approached drawing to be very helpful.<br />  It contains clear explanations that methodically lay out the appoaches by which artists apply their talents.  In doing so, he helps us to become more analytical and more understanding of art and the world around us.  This work by Harold Speed helps us become better observers. It is the most penetrating book on drawing techniques I have found.  This book is an excellent investment at about $10.00 on Amazon.con.	2005-10-08

Wilken shows how the early church interacted with early Hellenized thought.     These early theologians created a new world of thought that they used to seek the face of God. The author compared and contrasted early theologians masterfully. He not only gave the reader a glimpse into the church fathers' theological arguments, but their spiritual lives as well. Some of the topics the book covered are the trinity, all three members of the trinity, scripture, faith and reason, happiness, virtues, and love.     I can not think of a better introduction to pre-medieval theology and the book challenges me spiritually as well. It made me yearn more to seek the face of God.	2005-10-08

Consumed with the self-discipline and propriety dictated by the national character and emulation of the upper classes, Lucy Honeychurch finds herself between her stodgy cousin's checks and George Emerson's unconventional, bold, and straightforward sincerity. In the backdrop, just as in Howard's End, is the burgeoning realization of female identity and the possibility of greater freedoms.<br /><br />Forster creates rather familiar characters in the oppressed but promising Lucy, stuffy and financially dependent Charlotte, and traditional, sarcastic snob Cecil, whom Lucy opts to marry after several rejections, in order to avoid confusion about her own future and the doubts the Emersons have introduced. George Emerson, of course, is the modern knight--uncouth and unsmooth--but dangerous and attractive on a visceral level.<br /><br />What makes Room with a View special is not the content--covered territory, or the dialogue--witticisms and comedy of manners, but Forster's special insight into the characters that lets us know eveything they are and everything they can be, without deeply probing the people. It is a respect and dignity he grants his creations that makes them real.	2005-10-08

Finally, a Kennedy memoir I can sink my teeth into.  What I enjoyed most about this book is its human aspects and its honesty.  Mr. Lawford does not write from the viewpoint of victim.  He takes responsibility for his life and how he has lived it, and, as fate would have it, he has emerged triumphant and is proving to be a vital tool in the fight against addiction.  He is careful to point out that addiction knows no economic status.  It does not care if you are rich or poor, famous or anonymous.  He acknowledges that which most privileged adults of stature would conveniently leave out.  He never feels sorry for himself, not once.  Everything he covers in these pages is parallel to what was going on in his life at the time, and the \\"snapshots\\" inserted in each chapter are cleverly placed so they mirror what he is writing about in the particular time frame.  This book does not seek to be political nor does it seek to be another \\"oh woe is the Kennedy Clan.\\"  It's a story of conviction, addiction and redemption and I heartily recommend it.  There are many interesting photos included in the book as well.  Many not seen before now.  I wanted to stand up and cheer when I was finished with Lawford's tale.  Don't miss this one.

I have a lot of problems around the pelvic/hip/lumbar region and these exercises are a treasure to me. I feel I have only started taping into the benefits they can bring if done correctly. I keep coming back to the book and the exercises again and again. Totally recommended!	2005-10-08

One is that it throws readers directly into conversation and overwhelms them.  I used the book to pick up a few cultural niceties, but my Chinese friends laughed at my failure to use the correct tones.  The other problem is that it is shoehorned into the Dummies framework of organizing books rather than trying to absolute novices the basics first.  This book has good appendixes and other reference material.  It would be a great second book after you have mastered another approach of learning basic Chinese.  I quickly ditched this approach, and bought the Pimsleur series.	2005-10-08

Soehnlein begins this his second novel with the narrator Jamie Garner returning from San Francisco to his boyhood home of Greenlawn, New Jersey for the funeral of his father with whom he has not spoken nor visited for the past few years. It all had to do with his father's never having accepted his being gay. While on that visit Jamie, as he is going through the attic, discovers some old letters and photos that belonged to his father before he married Jamie's mother years ago. The rest of this hefty novel of over 400 pages is mostly about the narrator's quest to find out what happened in his father's life so long ago in California and to make some sort of sense of it all--as well as his sorting out his relationship with his lover Woody.<br /><br />There are many things to admire about YOU CAN SAY YOU KNEW ME WHEN. Mr. Soehnlein has written a most ambitious and dense novel with serious themes: the search for one's father, the importance of friendships, the difficulty of getting a relationship right. He writes with tremendous perception and at times turns phrases beautifully, getting the period and locales just right. In the 50's and 60's women had their hair done in \\"beauty parlors.\\" Now people broadcast their \\"personal life for all to hear\\" on cell phones in public places. The death of one family member-- or the death of anyone we care about for that matter-- brings back the remembrance of the death of someone else all over again. When Teddy meets for the first time Ray Gladwell, an artist with whom his father had had a brief affair with in 1960, she looks to see if he resembles his late father, a beautiful human touch by Soehnlein. When Jamie is attracted to a FedEx employee, he describes what could quickly take place between the two of them as happening in a \\"flirt-friendly environment.\\" Additionally the minor characters are fleshed out and for the most part endearing: Jamie's cousin Tommy and Anton, his marijuana supplier, just to name two. Mr. Soehnlein obviously loves San Francisco and it shows. He could convince anyone who hasn't been there to visit. The first section of the book entitled \\"The Son\\" is so well-written that it could stand alone as a short story. The family dynamics are just perfect.<br /><br />The novel, however, is about 50 pages too long. After my delight in reading the first 45 or so pages, I got bogged down and found the last half of the book heavy sledding-- to mix my metaphors. The problem: Jamie is totally believable but not very likeable. He is self-centered with a large streak of self-pity and not big of self-awareness. One friend after another points out to him that he is essentially like his father.<br /><br />Mr. Soehnlein is still a very fine writer and a cut above most of the current authors of gay novels. I would probably like this novel much better if I had not read and liked tremendously his first one, THE WORLD OF NORMAL BOYS.bviously loves San Francisco and it shows.

Books	2	9	23	N	N	Poor pigeon - we didn't enjoy his sad story	I've only read good reviews of this book, and was excited to buy it. Once we received it, I knew my 4 year old boy (who is admittedly a \\"sensitive soul\\") wouldn't like it. Throughout the book, he just felt sad for the bird who desparately wanted to drive this bus and who was repeatedly turned down, for no stated reason. I even switched the ending to indicate that the pigeon gets to drive the truck at the end so that my son wouldn't feel badly for him. Mostly, through story-reading time, my son would say \\"Don't worry, pigeon, we'll let you drive Mommy's car\\" etc.<br /><br />For an adult, the pigeon's comments were very funny as he tries to convince the people to let him drive, but I wouldn't recommend it for a preschooler.	2005-10-08

The swamps of the Carboniferous seem so dark and mysterious; the verdant forests at the opening of the Cenezoic Era are infused with the essence of life born anew.

Here is a timeless tale of love and transformation that first appeared 64 years ago, instantly became a best-seller, went through God only knows how many reprintings before sliding slowly into near-obscurity, along with its author, Olive Higgins Prouty, today all but forgotten.  Neither the author nor her book deserved this sorry end, and  The Feminist Press is to be congratulated for re-publishing \\"Now, Voyager.\\"  The publisher pigeonholes this novel as \\"pulp\\" writing, a sometimes derogatory term implying fiction that is popular but not very well written, and certainly not enduring literature.  This novel is  in fact anything but \\"pulp\\" fiction: \\"Now, Voyager\\" is a story brilliantly conceived, and the reader who takes a chance on this novel will be repaid with sheer exhilaration as the text soars on every page with rare lyricism and hauntingly beautiful passages.     Here's a typical sampler of Prouty's art:    \\"The pointed pinnacles of the cathedral loomed up above the heterogeneous mass of buildings surrounding it like the pointed tops of spruce above deciduous trees of various varieties.  The buildings crowded down to a string of small boats at the water's edge.  The blue bay was full of rippling reflections-sails, roofs, pinnacles, and mountain-tops.  The air was full of sunshine, breezes, gulls and gulls' calls.  The tenders were already plying between the liner and the shore.  Other little boats were chugging here and there, plying through the reflections, trailing long wakes of watered silk.\\"     The new edition is a faithful rendition of the original novel.  The only changes have been the addition of a foreword and afterword and chapter titles.  Misprints in the reprinted edition, not present in the original text, are irritating but fortunately rare.  There have been small changes in typography that are indeed helpful in bringing the typography up to a more easily readable modern standard.  The republished paperback and hardcover versions are identical, but the paperback has added a thumbnail biography of Prouty and its cover displays a publicity still from the well-known film with Bette Davis and Paul Henreid.    While overpriced, the hardcover edition has a binding and cover that are much more robust than those of the original 1941 edition; fittingly, this new hardcover \\"Now, Voyager\\" will last for generations. (A pristine first edition of \\"Now, Voyager\\", if you can find one, sells for over $1000.)	2005-10-08

Many, if not most of these, have come from white men living in Western nations who have in general benefited from globalization.  Now we have a book by a Chinese woman who has personal experience of the negative effects of globalization.  With this insight, a lot of research, and references of other works in the same genre, the author has written an intelligently argued, well written, easy to read, and comprehensive account of globalization in the 20th century with an emphasis on the decade since the end of the Cold War.   <br /> <br />In this book, she looks at the globalization that has occurred in Russia, China, Latin America, Indonesia and several other areas of the world.  She also looks at Germany prior to and during the Nazi period.  From these case studies, and by looking at the history of the US itself, she shows that the combination of free market economics and representative democracy that the US has convinced other countries to adopt in the last 20 - 30 years has led to economic and social chaos in those very same countries.  And the worse part, the US has rarely adopted these same practices that it has imposed on other countries.  In fact, it has even down the opposite.  As a clear example, she illustrates how the US adopted the New Deal as a remedy for the Great Depression.  Yet, when other countries have financial difficulties, the US, through the World Bank and the IMF, encourages those countries to trim spending, balance its budget, and tighten its financial policy.  The result, these countries have their economies screwed over for years or even decades.   <br /> <br />The added insight that this book provides over others in the same genre is how the combination of popular democracy fused with free-market economics often leads to social tensions broken down along racial or religious lines.  These tensions occasionally break out into civil strife, hence worsening the economic situation.   <br /> <br />What the book does not do is blame globalization, democracy, or free market economics.  The book does blame the policy of one-size-fits-all reforms that the US has forced onto other nations. <br /> <br />All in all a great book and worthy of reading for any history, economics, or poly sci major. <br /> <br />	2005-10-08

Although conventionaly focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has a physical, cognitive, behavioural, social and philosophical dimensions.\\"  Wikipedia<br /><br />Joan Didion starts her book:<br /> \\"Life changes fast<br />  Life changes in an instant<br />  You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends.\\"<br /><br />On December 30, 2003 Joan and her husband, John Gregory Dunne were just sitting down to dinner about 9pm. They had returned from visiting their daughter, Quintana, who was comatose in an ICU in New York City. They were having a conversation as Joan put dinner on the table. She looked up, it was very quiet, John was not responding. He was slumped over the table with his hand raised. She realized all was not well, and in that instant her life changed. An ambulance was called; the trip to the Emergency Department, the meeting with the doctor, massive heart attack mentioned, and she knew her husband was dead. She returned home alone, did a few chores and went to bed and slept soundly. She awakened and realized something was wrong, and her first taste of grief descended.<br /><br />Joan Didion has written a devastating story of her first year after the death of her husband, and the grief that enveloped her. She writes as she thought, and the story is laid out in detail as it happened and in her own words. She has friends and family but John isn't there. She talked to him every day for the forty years they were married. They talked constantly and were with each other all the time. Even though conventional wisdom has it that absence makes the heart grow fonder.  She remembers thinking \\"there is no one to hear the news, no where to go with the unmade plan, the uncompleted thought. There is no one to agree, disagree, talk back\\". Life changes in an instant. There is no place on earth to go where there is no memory. She kept expecting him to come back. She couldn't get rid of his shoes, because he needed shoes to come back. She knew this thought was irrational, but it kept her going.<br /><br />She kept busy helping her daughter and son-in-law put their life back together, and then it comes apart when Quintana becomes ill again. There is much to do, much to read about Quintana's illness, much to discuss with the hospital staff that look at her strangely when she discusses edema and too much \\"fluid overload\\". She immerses herself in the language of medicine, and it keeps her busy for a while. She tried new projects, nothing really works except time, but she still keeps expecting John to come home. He never does. She remembers all the little things he said about his life. He told her they had to go to Paris that November because he might never have the chance again. He was right.

I can't pretend to know what percentage of this book is actually true or what exactly Mr. Goldman's \\"agenda\\" was.   <br /> <br />One thing I do like about the book is the insight about John and Paul's relationship and their contributions to The Beatles music.  Like many of you, I've always been a devout student of their music and really tried to learn as much about who wrote what song and how the creative process of the band really worked.  I've always been a bit confused by the general perception that \\"Saint John\\" was somehow the greater artist of the two and Paul was the cute tunesmith who wrote silly love songs.  If you think that, I'd love to have a one on one debate with you.  Along with reading this book, the debate would make you reconsider your view.   <br /> <br />John was supposedly the \\"leader\\" of the band, yet, as the book shows and nobody disputes, at the most critical junctures of the band's artistic evolution, it was Paul who rose to the occasion and brought them to the next level, while John was off on his latest self indulgent, navel gazing search for himself.  Paul was the chief architect of Pepper and John's contributions were relatively minimal.  While Paul was writing and producing with George Martin the groundbreaking elements of Abbey Road, John was taking the usual path of an artist who's run out of ideas - going back to basic rock and roll (and stretching an average song fragment like \\"I Want You\\" in to an eight minute song by playing it three different ways).  If it weren't for Paul, the story of The Beatles would have ended much sooner and we'd have less great music to cherish and enjoy. <br /> <br />In short, John was the second best musician and songwriter in the greatest rock and roll band in musical history.  He contributed some of the greatest songs and lyrics the band produced.  Thatdoesn't make him a great man.  If you want to idolize a great Englishman, read one of the many books written about Winston Churchill - a man of truly great character who did a tad bit more for world peace than sit in bed with his wife. <br /> <br />If you think Goldman was wrong about John as a person, you have a remedy.  Do your research and write an 800 page book about what a selfless person, loyal husband, great father and all around great guy he was.  Lotsa luck. <br /> <br />	2005-10-08

Arab culture is often a difficult one for writers to convey accurately, as it is an equal mixture of eastern exoticism and western functionality.  Lean too heavily on one element or the other, and the picture becomes distorted.  In fact, much of the success of this book comes in the contrast and comparison of Arab culture, as embodied in the boy Raji, to the western influence, as represented by the archeologist Jim.  Neither culture is glorified nor condemned by the author, but each is treated respectfully and compassionately, despite the many differences between the two.  It is an enjoyable and well constructed story, that is written in a wonderful, easy flowing style.  It's clear that the author knows quite a bit about the history and artifacts of Petra and this information brings added richness to the tale, as do a good number of supporting characters.  All in all, it's a great read and a memorable story that readers across the generations can enjoy.	2005-10-08

Cobb caught my attention with the vivid descriptions compiled in this book.  I like the fact that as i sat and read it, I could picture the story as if I were sitting in the middle of the scene.  It touched on the life of a military officer in both her professional and personal life.  Although there are things that are mentioned in the book that in real life would not happen, it is interesting in this novel how Cobb weaves them in to a story, and we follow Commander Garrett through her trials.  The descriptions of the action scenes are some of the best that I have ever read.	2005-10-08

Some of the book is quite interesting and well done, however it is continually undermined by the most outrageous plot twists and implausible characters. The story begins with the gruesome torture and disemboweling of an elderly Jewish man in his squalid apartment in a run-down Jewish neighborhood of Istanbul. The huge swastika painted in blood on the wall would seem to indicate an racist dimension, but is it that simple?<br /><br />Meanwhile, the reader is also introduced to Robert, a pathetic Englishman who has fled personal disaster back home to teach English to uninterested students in Istanbul. The major event in his life right now is his twice-weekly tryst with exotically beautiful Natalia (half Russian, half Turkish) who bestows her favors on him in exchange for expensive gifts (he, on the other hand, is besotted and in love with her). She is a mysterious woman who lives to exercise her sexual power over men, but her family of hermetically preserved White Russians is much more bizarre in a very gothic way. And when Robert thinks he sees Natalia fleeing from the murder site, he, her family, and an elderly German industrialist become a part of Inspector Ikmen's investigation.<br /><br />There's a lot to like about the mid-1990s Istanbul setting and the Turkish characters. Nadel has lived in the city and does a nice job of capturing some of the details of daily life. The central character, police Inspector Ikmen is a fine example of the grizzled, grumpy, but brilliant, veteran detective addicted to his job. The father of eight children, with a ninth on the way, he makes his way through a bottle of brandy and 50 cigarettes a day as he pursues justice. Equally compelling are his supporting cast, including the handsome but shyly devout Muslim Sgt. Suleyman (in the midst of avoiding an arranged marriage), Armenian medical examiner Dr. Sarkissian (like so many of his fictional counterparts, he's got a sharp tongue and sense of humor), lascivious Jewish officer Cohen, and Ikemn's acid-tongued ex-professor father, Timur.<br /><br />However, there's a lot not to like as well. Principally, the groan-inducing convoluted plot twists which drag the story's tendrils back to the end of Tsarist Russia. Similarly, Natalia's Russian emigre family is just far too strange to be taken realistically. They exist on a cartoon/horror movie level totally removed from the rest of the book. And as if an entire family of unhinged delusional isn't enough, by the end of the story, Robert has also completely lost control of himself. Nor does it help that the plot relies a little too heavily on people happening to be in places at just the right time. There's also a lame mystical element involving Inspector Ikmen's transvestite seer cousin which smacks of gratuitous exoticism for its own sake. The finale is so over-the-top that one comes close to chucking the book across the room in exasperation. Ultimately, the book is a disappointment, but the setting and Turkish characters are strong enough (although too calculatedly multi-cultural) that I may try the second book to see if gets any better.<br /><br />NOTE: The series continues A Chemical Prison (published in the U.S. as The Ottoman Cage), Arabesk, Deep Waters, Harem, Petrified, Deadly Web, and Dance With Death.Sarkissian (like so many of his fictional counterparts, he's got a sharp tongue and sense of humor), lascivious Jewish officer Cohen, and Ikemn's acid-tongued ex-professor father, Timur. <br /> <br />However, there's a lot not to like as well.

This story is patriotic and thoughtful, examining terrestrial issues like family and duty, as well as ET issues and technology advances.  Despite being very old, it still reads like a current work.

Tazi and the Adventure of Moroccan Cinema	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Moroccan Film & Third World Challenges	Few Americans have seen Muhammad Abderrahman Tazi's films and Kevin Dwyer is an anthropologist. But you needn't be a specialist to find this book fascinating. As Tazi's career is described, readers will also learn a great deal about film making, Morocco's colonial hangover, and the effects of globalization on Third World culture.    <br /> <br />Dwyer is well qualified to write about Morocco and its arts. He has spent much of his professional life there and in other North African countries and is now Professor of Anthropology at the American University in Cairo. As demonstrated in this and previous books, he is also well qualified to conduct the interviews on which much of Beyond Casablanca is based. Thoughtful questions and comments put his subjects at ease. There is organization and direction, but we feel we are privy to the conversations of friends -- without the grinding of personal or academic axes. <br /> <br />Foreign film producers often take advantage of Morocco's exotic settings and lower production costs, and so Tazi has worked with Scorsese, Coppola, Huston and others. His credits include \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\", \\"The Black Stallion Returns\\" and \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\". On the latter, a John Huston film, Tazi assisted with casting, recommended shooting locations and managed portions of the production effort. As he describes his early practical experience we begin to appreciate the logistics of creating a film. Whether in Morocco or Hollywood the basic requirements are the same. Casting, scene location, lighting, shooting sequences, props, continuity, sound mix, camera angles and perspective are some of the elements discussed here.  <br /> <br />It's intriguing to hear a director talk about technique. Tazi tells us he tends to shoot from a distance rather than close in. He believes close-ups ruin \\"objectivity\\" and intrude on more appropriately private space. It's even more intriguing to learn that early in his career, lacking guide tracks andSteadicams, the director shot from the trunk of a moving car or from a wheelbarrow pushed by an assistant. I won't take the cameraman for granted the next time I watch Indiana Jones tearing away from a mortal threat. <br /> <br />Dwyer knows that the technical problems of a Third World film maker are a good stand-in for the more general challenges faced by ex-colonies. That wheelbarrow is a not so subtle reminder of what they face as they adjust to independence. Dwyer traces Tazi's evolution from wheelbarrow to digital editing, a difficult trip that remains incomplete. The parallel journey from colony to viable independent state is unimaginably more challenging and happy endings are far from given. Physical infrastructure, the economy, and governmental and educational systems must be rethought and made more effective. Pessimism and frustration have many thousands of Moroccans taking to small boats to cross the Mediterranean on dangerous voyages to Spain as illegal immigrants, a problem Tazi highlights in two of his more serious films. <br /> <br />The film maker's career also demonstrates that globalization can add to the woes of a country such as Morocco. It makes digital technology more readily available so it's easier and less expensive for Tazi to create the movie he wants, but at the same time he must now compete with U.S. media giants. Because of the limited number of screens in Morocco and the lack of foreign interest, Moroccan films invariably lose money. That means funding is scarce and only 10 or so films are made each year in spite of strong domestic interest. American films, profitable because of enormously wider distribution, fill much of the vacuum. Over 95% of the movies shown in Morocco are by foreign producers. Analogous problems plague many Third World industries. Proponents, including me, believe globalization will be for the best longer term, but there is increasing recognition that governments must intervene to temper market forces as long as there are huge imbalances in relative strength. <br /> <br />Fighting through the paucity of funding, weak technical support and strong foreign competition, Tazi has produced and directed five feature films. Beyond Casablanca describes the plot and circumstances of production of each in some detail. One of the clearest messages is that he makes movies that tell stories about, as he says, \\"... what haunts me\\". That's one of the reasons he is a frequent winner at various international festivals.  <br /> <br />I think some American films are terrific and many more are entertaining, but few American directors make films because they have stories to tell about what haunts them. Even the most successful, and therefore independent, check marketing studies before they get very far into a new project. It's a business with big stakes. Film company managements have input and writers tend to come in teams designed to ensure something for everyone. M. A. Tazi on the other hand knows even his most popular films won't breakeven. He makes them because he has to. That's a pretty good definition of being an artist and Beyond Casablanca is well worth reading for its insight into an artist's mind and for the light it sheds on some of today's most difficult and controversial international social and economic issues. <br />	2005-10-08

Packed with interesting anecdotes and behind-the-scenes stories, a New Brand World offers helpful take-aways in the areas of commodity branding, the brand mantra, and proven ways to live the brand. My favorite line: When it comes to branding, \\"Everything matters.\\" Bedbury goes on to say, \\"For every grand and finely worded statement by the CEO, the brand is also defined by derisory consumer comments overheard in a hallway, or in a chat room on the Internet. Brands are sponges for content, for images, for fleeting feelings. They become psychological concepts held in the minds of the public, where they may stay forever. As such you can't entirely control a brand. At best you can only guide and influence it.\\"	2005-10-08

I find that I usually learn a lesson better after making a mistake than if things had gone smoothly.  In the same vein, a straight-up rebuke often changes a bad course while a dozen nice \\"words to the wise\\" fail to get my attention.  \\"78 Reasons...\\" takes this corrective path, and does so admirably.  An editor who has experienced the bad and the good, Pat Walsh is eminently qualified to tell it like it is.  And he does so without mincing words (although there's some humor to leaven things a bit).  Many the 78 and 14 reasons average about a page, while some are bit longer.  But all are worth reading by an aspiring author who seeks the holy grail of publication.<br /><br />Bottom line, many of the obstacles to getting published are due to character flaws, lack of talent, or industry ignorance on the part of the would-be author.  For example, the person who won't revise a manuscript, cannot tell a story, or doesn't understand the publishing game.  These folks often refuse to believe that the problem is between the chair and the keyboard.  That's sad, because a little self-correction can go a long way.  Thin-skinned writers that refuse to work on their weaknesses, or who are simply annoying jerks, won't get published.  Indeed, their biggest creation will be a bad reputation among editors and publishers.<br /><br />As for the 14 good reasons, they are mostly virtues that will serve anyone well regardless of occupation.  Taking calculated risks, being flexible, and learning from rejection are all qualities that can lead to publication for a humble, solid writer with something to say.  In addition to the correction and encouragement, Mr. Walsh provides a look into the nuts and bolts of the publishing world.  He serves up interesting information about writing conferences, self-publishing, agents, and much more.  Even those merely curious about how books get from manuscript to shelf (virtual or otherwise) will find these insights fascinating.<br /><br />This is a necessary manual for a writer.  And as Mr. Walsh warns, don't skip the 78 in favor of the 14.  If you do that, you may miss out on the boot to the head you need to get on the right track towards publication.necessary manual for a writer.

The book was very clear explaining clearly on <br /> <br />> What is a commodity <br />>How is commodity quantified (bushnels etc) <br />>Trends on Individual commodities <br />>How counties are influencing Commodity futures <br /> <br />His topics on trends in commodities were very eye opening.He also is very successful in busting the 'Indian' myth and giving due respect to 'China' with respect to commodities.  on reading further about the author, had plenty of bad press for him..the guy is more of a show man etc, had lot of phony trades etc .  <br /> <br />But the book was simply impeccable to understand the commodity business very well.Highly recommend	2005-10-08

To be honest, I thumbed through it four times after receiving it from Amazon and I didn't find any good info it (i.e. nothing about it really grabbed me) and I haven't looked at it since - so take my review for whats it worth.

We need way less tax than we have, but if fairtx is instituted we will have the exact same amount of tax we do now.

He is mostly successful.  This work slightly more accessible than Grudem or Erickson and would provide a competent introduction to a beginning student of theology.  It is actually more of a joint introduction to historical and systematic (since he does not actually begin to tackle the systematic categories until 205 pages in) and it works well as such, but it leaves him very limited room to build a comprehensive \\"Christian Theology\\".<br /><br />My main critique of this is that despite his space limitations McGrath often gets sidetracked, devoting large chunks of text to advanced or non-central topics (which, to be fair, I often enjoyed) that detract from the general, introductory appeal he claimed to be persuing.  This is most egregious under the doctrine of God where the debate over the suffering of God, theodicy and God's gender comprise nearly half the text.  Still, if you are looking get a joint intro to historical and systematic theology while \\"only\\" investing 500 pages (rather than the very worthwhile 1000 + or - of Grudem or Erickson) McGrath is a fantastic guide and this text would fit those purposes well.	2005-10-08

However, its major failure is exemplified by Mr. Sowell review below.  The tragic mistake of confusing totalitarianism with socialism is repeated here.  Mr. Sowell's soundbite \\"redistribution of wealth leads to redistribution of poverty\\" is just plain wrong. Some counter examples might include Social Security, Medicare, and Urban Housing assistance--all products of socialism that have immensely benefited our society.  Sweden, one of the most socialized countries in the world, is also judged by The Economist as one of the most economically competitive--the point is that Sweden is socialistic but democratic.  That a learned scholar, Mr. Muravchik, would fail to clarify the difference in a substantial text is disappointing.	2005-10-08

While the book traces the return of the individual crews to the United States in an interesting and insightful way, there is a glaring lack of analysis on how the Roosevelt administration failed to adequately implement a communications plan to achieve its war aims or to maximize the war morale back home - the stated goal of the Doolittle Raid.    Written at a level for junior high students, this book both glamorizes Doolittle and really fails to demonstrate that he was, despite some real failures in implementation, the indispensable man making the raid happen.  No other officer had the flying experience combined with the engineering skills to drive the raid from 25 page document to bombs on target in less than 3  months.  There are many small inaccuracies in the book which, no doubt, the editors left in for the sake of readability.    This book is the best analysis of the planning and implementation of the raid.  This is not my opinion.  I read this book to help a scholar I work with on a project.  Every military historian and every librarian that I talked to mentioned that this book was the only one that really walked through the plan from the original idea to execution with any level of detail.     My main complaint about the book is that it fails to discuss how the Roosevelt administration, after initially fumbling, used the raid and the execution of some of the raiders by the Japanese to inspire enthusiasm for the war.  That additional element would move the book from the realm of rousing war story to serious analysis of history.      Overall importance of the raid to the outcome of World War II is still debated today.  Recently declassified information about high altitude balloon firebombing indicates that the Japanese were motivated to pursue this costly and ineffective technique by the Doolittle Raid.  Likewise, many argue that the raid forced Japan to pursue further expansion eastward toward Midway and Hawaii - a strategy that resulted in the destruction of Japan's carrier forces during the Battle of Midway.  However, many historians argue that damage from the raid was inconsequential; the loss of 16 B-25 was a poor exchange for the small amount of damage done.  Likewise, the battle at Midway or similar turning point would have happened because Japan had exceeded their ability to support their far flung forces and any attempt to advance any further in any direction would have resulted in a crushing defeat.    To this reader, none of that makes any difference.  The Doolittle Raid ultimately transcends World War II and even the participants.  Ultimately, the raid was about creativity and ingenuity in a time of great stress.  This book captures that creativity and describes how it came to be reality.  As we engage in the war of our generation, the Global War on Terrorism, we could do worse than to learn from the genius of the Doolittle Raid.	2005-10-08

The tale is told from multiple first person viewpoints, primarily from that of Otori Takeo or Shirakawa Kaede.  The story unfolds a tale of Takeo's struggle with his multiple heritage, and Kaede's hardships imposed upon her by a Male ruled, female submissive society; their love for one another brings a strong motive in their unified fight to bring peace to their countries.<br /><br /> Hearn is a magnificent writer.  She fills her stories with vast amounts of images and meaning.  There is rarely an idea that does not have a second meaning.  The tale invokes some part of you to feel sympathy for Takeo and Kaede, and a desire for them and their love to succeed over all the hardships.  The intense shifts from high paced action and slower but deliberate movements of dialogue keep you in the moment with the characters, and on the edge of your seat.  She uses beautiful images as omens for the characters, as well as you the reader to observe and try to decipher the direction of the books.  Unexpected twists come in the most exiting places to keep the story alive, and hints and info from the narrator helps to fill in certain gaps here and there.  Lian remains very true to the time period and setting, as well as the mentality of the people of the time.  You grow to know and love or hate these characters, and when one dies in the raging war, your heart really does feel sorrow for those we care about, and happiness with the passing of those we do not.  While slightly sexually suggestive at times, it helps to strengthen our understanding of the time period, and the bonds between charectors.	2005-10-08

Another Civil War group called Sons of Liberty was a secessionist underground Union network in Richmond, Virginia.   The Copperheads, the Confederate spy network, plagued the Union throughout the War.  In 1862, in Baltimore, the Black German used betrayal to risk the life of the woman he loved for the \\"cause.\\"  She in turn betrays another young woman.  Thus is the life and insecurity at the time of a war, any war.    The '48ers were a group of Europeans living in America who fought for the Union.  They were highly educated men and women who'd already developed tools and talents of leadership.  Elizabeth Van Lew, a proud Southern spy for the Union, should have known better.  We would have called her a 'turn-coat.'    The fictional story concerns Eden and Holly, after they join the Sons of Liberty.  Brandon Rolf has a woman, Charise, whose duty is in the undercover world of espionage.  Maryland has the North/South boundary and tried to be non-partisan during the great Civil War.  Feeling Southern sympathies, it is nonetheless a part of the North and most fought for the Union side.  But, then, so did Knoxville, Tennessee.  And I would have been a Confederate spy for sure.	2005-10-08

Not sure why all the reviews here are for the textbook because these are the Audio CDs for the Genki I textbook.<br /><br />I just purchased them from Amazon and received them in the mail today. The first CD contains audio for the main Genki I Textbook while the second CD contains audio for the Genki I Workbook.<br /><br />The publishers website mentions a 6 CD set but I have been unable to find them anywhere... even from the publishers website. Up until now I had been using audio cassettes that the school provided. There are 6 of them so maybe there was just some confusion.<br /><br />The main textbook, workbook, and audio CDs equal a great learning experience. I'm about 3/4ths of the way through it, learning with a small group. It's been a lot of fun and one of the easier language immersions I've experienced. Do you need the CDs to learn the language? I'd say yes... for a while I avoided listening to the audio, only depending on the class sessions to train my ear instead. After so many classes I found myself falling behind and unable to understand the teacher because she started to talk at a normal speed and in full sentences. Doing the homework with these audio CDs are a great help.	2005-10-08

This is not your run-of-the-mill true crime story regarding serial killers.  Two things set this book apart from the usual stories of this genre.  First, Dr. Linda Hazzard's theory of starvation curing all illnesses was accepted as a legitimate practice and she was sought out by many wealthy people.  Secondly, she and her con-artist husband didn't lurk in bushes, or lure young girls and prostitutes to their deaths at bars or roadsides.  The victims sought out Dr. Hazzard!   <br /> <br />Gregg Olsen has written a book that delves into the mind of a woman who was beyond cruel and manipulative...a female Rasputin who was able to convince people, as they were dying from starvation, that she was actually helping them, all in the name of greed.	2005-10-08

He really knows how to write about the internal and external struggles children face.  But that didn't happen in LOST BOYS. <br /> <br />This thing tanked badly.  As noted in another review, it began as a short story and I agree that it should have been left there.  LOST BOYS had such potential, too.  The book focuses on the parents, not Stevie, who should be the real interest of the book.  If this work had been written primarily from HIS perspective, it may have worked very well.  The mother's constant worrying about EVERYthing is overly described, distracting, infuriating, and does nothing to move the work along.  The father's occupation, however, is interesting and you wish OSC had better described the fictional game the character became so noted for (\\"Hacker Snack.\\")  There was good information about computers, though. <br /> <br />OSC chewed up a lot of unnecessary time by spending it on the descriptions of the Mormon religion which had nothing to do with the plot.   <br /> <br />If this book had focused more on the hook given on the dust jacket, it would have been better.  I struggled through it because I wanted to see how Stevie discovered a program with no software, how a computer programmer father could address it, how the lost boys became a part of it all, WHY such a program could exist; but there was just not enough here.  A final point with possible SPOILER:  the ending was good, but made you say HUH?? when you learn who the killer is.  All clues to that person's identity seem to have been intentionally left out and it further frustrates you to learn that you chased nothing but red herrings.  I suggest that if you want to read it, borrow it or get it from a library.	2005-10-08

Dr. Davis Moore is a doctor who specializes in cloning for fertility purposes.  When his daughter is raped and killed, and no suspect is ever arrested, he decides to clone the killer to discover his physical features.  He takes a special interest in this child as he grows up, hoping to glean some insight into the man who killed his daughter.  Also significant to the plot is a virtual reality game that just about everyone plays called Shadow World.<br /><br />Shadow World is one of the best aspects of the novel, I think.  An online gaming community where you start off as yourself -- your own life, your own job, but you can become whoever you want to be, do things you would never do in real life.  And it's online, so you're interacting with other players who are doing the same thing.  This game seems both plausible and enticing.<br /><br />People who know me know that I usually have one major gripe about books:  The endings always suck.  Not this time.  This ending works better than 9/10ths of the books I've read in the past year.  It raises so many questions about what could have been done differently and I liked the unsettledness of the ending.  It couldn't have ended better.<br /><br />Highly recommend.  What a great debut novel.	2005-10-08

Both have been previously published. This has caused some consternation from some people who believed they were getting something new and instead got something they already had. If you have not read either of them, however, it's a great deal. <br /> <br />They two included books are CRUSADE and IN DEATH GROUND. Individual reviews appear below: <br /> <br />CRUSADE <br />I am hooked on the Honor Harrington series. I have spent so much time reading them that, when I was done, I was disappointed because I had nothing else from Weber to read until the next one comes out. I forgot to check for some of his other works. I wouldn't have thought he would have time to write anything else. WRONG! <br /> <br />CRUSADE pits the human federation against a new alien species which considers itself saviors dedicated to saving Terra and humanity for the evil Orions who just happen to be uneasy allies of humanity. It takes a while to figure out how this strange turn of events came to be but, when it finally comes out, it makes sense. Religious zealots are at work promoting a jihad for personal advantage. Their only contact with humanity came at a time when it was at war against the Orions. <br /> <br />A major problem is that the Orions are a warrior culture and their alliance with humanity is an uneasy one. When the new aliens, the Thebans, are first encountered, it is the Orions they attack and they do so in the name of humanity. Resolving this is left up to humanity but the Orions are keeping a suspicious eye on the situation. <br /> <br />The battles are well thought out and fans of space battles will appreciate the book. Just as interesting are the political battles. For me, they are even more interesting to read. It's a good book worth the time. <br /> <br /> <br />IN DEATH GROUND <br />Humanity and its allies face a deadly enemy. That enemy is one so different that even communication is impossible withthem. Only a few things are really known. They look like giant spiders. They attack without warning. They are very powerful. They eat most of their victims. The rest they raise as livestock for future consumption. <br /> <br />The naval commanders charged with protecting humanity, and later the rest of the alliance, face terrible choices with frightening consequences. They can't save everybody. That means that the ones who are not saved are going to be eaten. They realize that throwing themselves into battle anyway just increases the odds that all of the allies will lose. Before they can fight the big battle, they must fight rearguard actions and marshal their forces. Whatever they do, people are going to die, people are going to be eaten and the nightmares will come. This book and its sequel do the best job I have ever encountered of pointing out the pain that can come with major commands.  <br /> <br />Its not a fun read but it is a good one. Its also a cliffhanger. <br />	2005-10-08

There's something about this book because it was buried on the bottom of the shelf.  It's in the relationship section of your bookstore and it really stands out when the aisle is filled with men.  At the time I stopped in, there were six other men flipping through the pages.  I thought they were all reading the Bible because of the gold binding and faux leather cover.  There is even a red nylon book mark attached to the binding.  After I bought this book my friend came over and asked if I was reading the Bible.  I was, but I was reading the Other Man's Bible as I now call it.<br /><br />This book is a terrific read.  The general flow is suspenseful as you follow Neil in his travels from Average Frustrated Chump to player Pick Up Artist.<br /><br />You don't have to want to be a Pick Up Artist in order to read this book.  If anything, this book will reveal those secrets you always have pondered from your observations in the bar or club.

My wife is an early childhood specialist, and was once the head of the children's book department at a major independent bookstore, so she has seen MANY children's books.  I teach illustration at two colleges, so I have seen a LOT of children's book art. We both agree author Sharon Creech and illustrator David Diaz have cooked up something really special with 'Who's That Baby?'.  <br />Creech's poems are brief but speak volumes. Her charming cadence rejoices in real-life details about parenting, babies, and 'Grandmas with not very big vocabularies' (who only say 'Oooh' and 'Aaah', and 'Awww', and 'Oh!).  <br />I was a David Diaz fan long before he won the 1990 Caldecott Medal, children's book illustration's highest honor, for Smoky Night, a sort of 'The-Snowy-Day-meets-the-L.A.-riots' child's-eye narrative that is both fierce and tender.  In this new book, Diaz's glowing watercolors halo infant faces so engaging I cannot look away. <br />Some may find the book short -- two of its sixteen poems offer only eight lines -- my daughter, for one, can't get enough of it.	2005-10-08

The method described for making fresh pasta by hand is the same as the one used by my grandmother, who was born and raised in Emilia.  Excellent book that captures the essence of typical Italian cooking, and as the prior reviewer notes, the Vodka Pasta recipe is worth the price of the book.	2005-10-08

I own all of the books he has written or co-written, but have generally avoided the tie-ins that are largely the work of others.  I should have avoided this one too.<br /><br />The text, what there is of it, is almost entirely lifted from \\"Thud!\\" and is a \\"funny once\\" for those familiar with Discworld.  And if you've read \\"Thud!\\" you've read this. But it's the illustrations which ruin this work for me.  Pratchett has tended to avoid detailed physical descriptions of his characters, leaving it to the reader's imagination.  I therefore found it jolting that the depiction of Sam Vimes, in particular, was so completely unlike my own mental image of him. Paul Kidby's illustrations in \\"The Last Hero\\" seemed to fit much better.<br /><br />If you're buying this book thinking it would be good to read to a young child, think again.  It is a book about a children's book, not the book itself.  The illustrations are lavish, and it would appear that there's lots of detail to savor, but the depiction of Sam Vimes as looking like Buzz Lightyear really was a turnoff to me.<br /><br />If you have to own \\"everything Pratchett\\", then go ahead and buy this too.  It's certainly not bad.  But I found it rather unfulfilling.  If you haven't already, buy Pratchett's \\"Once More (With Footnotes)\\" from Amazon.  Now THAT is a worthwhile read!	2005-10-08

He has a hard time in school and the kids make fun, but in the end he lands a cool job doing sound effects for a radio show.  It's an older Dr Suess book, written in the 1960's I think.  Some parents don't care for it because they don't like how Gerald is made out to be shunned for being different.

Harris presents a precise, rational, logical and academically authentic argument for reason over blind belief. The conflict is so emotionally charged, of course, that readers on the extreme ends of the argument will find the book reinforces their pre-existing positions, notwithstanding the curious irony of two seekers discovering their own versions of truth in a single, shiny nugget. Rationalists will welcome the case Harris makes; believers will see it as an another example of clever word-smithing against the Word, i.e. belief in any religion. <br />However, if you're looking for possible answers, valuable information and some glimmer of illumination on your personal quest for understanding of how the world works and why, \\"The End of Faith\\" will give you more than a little of what you're after.

Ah, another example of too much time and too big an axe to grind. <br /> <br />Sterling arguments this book makes: <br /> <br />1. DARE is a program established by \\"the man\\" to keep us down. There I was thinking it was a well-meaning but misguided government attempt to protect the people... Shows what I know. <br /> <br />2. The upper eschelon of society is a conspiracy formed to keep us from attaining social heights. But no one knows that. Not even them. <br /> <br />3. Funny cartoons make serious points more serious!

Further, Perucci and cohorts openly admit at some points that their arguments make no sense and sink to giving the reader visual aides.

However, I think the Dresden Files books are a great read. They're the first books I've read in years that haven't been a labor to get through--they're a fun, exciting series. <br /> <br />I just finished Fool Moon earlier today, and I admit, the inconsistancies of Dresden's character are sometimes annoying (SPOILER: for example, he decides to tell Murphy about the White Council and the Nevernever but doesn't get the chance... and yet when Dresden mentions the White Council in front of Murphy, she doesn't ask about it, and he doesn't clarify what it is. Perhaps the plot was too convoluted for Butcher to keep track of all the seeds he was planting?), they are minor errors and don't take away from the enjoyment of the book. In fact, even with all the bumbling heroes popping up lately--like a previous reviewer mentioned--this one seems the most genuine of the lot, and the most interesting. It's pulpy fantasy at it's best, and I can't wait to get the next book.	2005-10-08

Set in 1942-43, it is the diary of a young man waiting to be drafted (Bellow himself was deferred so long that eventually he joined the Merchant Marine). Although the self-centered story of Joseph waiting for his draft call becomes annoying at times--it brings to mind the criticism made about James Joyce's \\"Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man,\\" namely that it focuses too intently on the author gazing into a mirror in unblinking self-regard--Bellow manages to insert some wonderful lyric passages into the diary form of the story. <br />   <br />For someone of my age (71) it's especially nostalgic to read the contemporary references to the World War II era: \\"both doors of the phonograph were open;\\" the songs \\"Mr. Five-by-five\\" and \\"Chattanooga Choo-Choo;\\" rationing of leather goods, sugar, coffee, gasoline, and butter; hoarding; the conga; baking days and washing days; the navy transport plane called the Catalina; a blacked out street lamp bent over a curb on a rainy night; war mothers knitting mufflers; \\"Your Hit Parade;\\" doors shut with pneumatic arms; pants in the new style saving cloth, without cuffs; Bataan.  <br />  <br />Bellow cites other telling details that resonated with me personally: \\"I was forever buying books...As long as they surrounded me they stood as guarantors of an extended life...\\" \\"I fell back into bed and spent an hour or so...watching the dark beams from the slats of the blind wheeling on the upper wall.\\" <br /> <br />Bellow's protagonist is a \\"reflective man\\" who suffers from a feeling of strangeness, who seeks to know who he is. Like his literary successor, Augie March, he is fenced around, less than a whole man. He holds lengthy internal debates with his Other whom he calls \\"But on the Other Hand, Tu As Raison Aussi.\\" <br /> <br />Yet he can appreciate the majesty of nature: \\"The clouds were sheared back from a mass of stars chattering in the hemispheric blackness--the universe, this windy midnight, out on its eternal business.\\" <br /> <br />The author's magnificent ability with words stops the reader cold: \\"For every need there is an entrepreneur, by a marvelous providence. You can find a man to bury your dog, rub your back, teach you Swahili, read your horoscope, murder your competitor.\\" <br /> <br />There is a great deal of autobiographical reference in this work: Bellow actually grew up on St. Dominique Street in Montreal, mentioned in the text; in Chicago he lived near Humboldt Park, also referred to. Though the story is short on plot--a drunken party, a fight, a long period of waiting and privation, a stressed marriage--his writing can reach inside the reader's gut, as in his description of the pleasure he took in shining shoes as a child (in my case it was polishing coins): \\"the stove shone on the davenport and on the oilcloth and on my forehead, drawing the skin pleasantly. I did not clean shoes because I was praised for it, but because of the work and the sensations of the room, closed off from the wet and the fog of the street, with its locked shutters and the faint green of the metal pipes along the copings of its houses.\\" In fact, his descriptions of the slum inhabited by Joseph have a strongly Dickensian ring: \\"chimneys pointed heavenward in openmouthed exhaustion...houses, their doors and windows open, drawing in the freshness, were like old drunkards of consumptives taking a cure....[T[he smeary blind eyes of windows...in hope of an impossible rejuvenation.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Dangling Man\\" is an underappreciated, under read marvel. <br />	2005-10-08

(Eph 5:23  KJV) For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.  (Eph 5:24  KJV) Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing. (1 Cor 11:9 KJV)  Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. (1 Cor 11:4 KJV)  Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.  (1 Cor 11:5 KJV)  But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. (Luke 2:23 KJV)  (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) (Titus 2:4 KJV)  That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,  (Titus 2:5  KJV) To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.  (Col 3:18 KJV) Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.  (1 Pet 3:1 KJV)  Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;  (1 Pet 3:5 KJV)  For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:  (1 Pet 3:6 KJV)  Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.  (1 Pet 3:7 KJV)   Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.  (Gen 3:16 KJV)  Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.  (1 Tim 2:11 KJV)  Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.  (1 Tim 2:12 KJV)  But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.  (1 Tim 2:13 KJV)  For Adam was first formed, then Eve.  (1 Tim 2:14 KJV)  And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.  (1 Tim 2:15 KJV)  Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.  I applaud Elizabeth Rice Handford.	2005-10-08

He does not really believe in their cause, and definitely isn't after glory on the battlefront; he is fighting because his family would be shamed, and possibly even killed, if he didn't. Yuan is captured after a dangerous retreat and wakes up injured in a hospital as a war prisoner. Ha Jin, an effortlessly powerful and intelligent writer, takes the 'war is hell' approach away from the front lines and casts its light onto the plight of POWs, who must struggle to survive a deadly, \\"Lord of the Flies\\" type battle for superiority and favor among their fellow prisoners. Yuan, an educated man fluent in English, is quickly sought after for his communication skills but is largely unable to fit in with his fellow prisoners, who are suspicious of his alliances and envious of his talents. His devotion to the Communists is constantly called into question, but even the Nationalists Yuan encounters question his motives. Yuan remains stuck in the middle, a man who did not want to fight in the first place but must convince the Communists of his sincerity in order to return home to his ailing mother and beloved fiance. Through his eyes we see the hypocrisy, violence, and baseness of all sides in the war. Because Yuan is not truly allied with any of the sides he encounters he can see them for what they truly are -- from the American GIs guarding the prisoners to the Communists he must endear himself to, Yuan lays bare the cold realities of their existence. He seethes with indignity at the Communist government that is using him as an object, and at how his superiors in prison continue to do the same.  Yuan wants nothing but to return home, even though he knows that he will be branded a coward by his government and must forever live with the stigma of being 'war trash'. The Communist government sees his very life as an embarassment to them, because they teach their soldiers that they should die fighting rather than be taken captive. What do you do when no one trusts you or gives a damn whether you live or die?<br /><br />\\"War Trash\\" is an excellent novel.

As a University Lecturer, I was disappointed with this book  because it contains large sections of material copied from  datasheets and web sites without proper references. We try to  teach our students to be ethical, and not to simply cut and  paste from the Internet without references. The author assures  me that permission was obtained from Microsoft, Intel,  Microchip, Sharp, etc. to re-publish their material.    It is not a text for a beginner if you want to learn about  robotics or how to design your own circuits and program  embedded systems. For instance, it assumes that you can already  program in C.    However, it does contain detailed instructions for building a  robot that can be controlled using the Infra Red port on a PDA.  If you don't mind making your own circuit board, then this  might be the book for you, but you really need some basic  background in electronics and computers if you intend to build  this robot. If you treat it as a recipe, and try to learn from  the exercise, then you might find it useful.	2005-10-08

Ceram includes chapters on Pompeii, the discovery of Troy, the pyramids and Valley of the Kings in Egypt, deciphering the cuneiform script, ancient Babylon and Ur, and New World discoveries in Mexico and Peru, among other topics. The text is succinct (it is a pictorial history), but clear and focused. Ceram is also willing to venture an opinion here and there; for example, he believes Schliemann's methods at Troy were not as bad as most make them out to be and archaeologists need to cut him a break. The pictures and photographs (310 of them) complement the text beautifully. For someone new to the field or wanting a brief outline of the major events (Ceram even includes a thorough chronological table listing important archaeological matters), this is an excellent source.	2005-10-08

The title and back cover intrigued me since I figured that it was a response to Moneyball. Although I lean more towards that side of the argument, I was curious to read a well-written counterpoint. Not a great choice.  <br /> <br />The book is basically made up of chapters that select several Braves and looks at how they were drafted and how their progression through the minors went. In between thoughts or at the end of chapters, the author would throw in a line about how stats didn't mean anything when looking at Player X, it was all scouting. Well, maybe. But HOW? The author writes at length about Chipper Jones before he was drafted and shows how the Braves were trying to make a last ditch effort to convince Todd Van Poppel to sign. When they coudn't convince him they went for Chipper because he showed \\"toughness\\". Hellooo, he was the concensus #2 and the Braves still preferred Van Poppel. The Braves lucked into Chipper. <br /> <br />Chapter after chapter about each player was the same. Player X had skills, player wanted to play for Braves since he was a kid, Braves steal him in the draft, player makes the team or is used as trade bait. Nothing about the loads of players that every team drafts who amount to nothing. The secret, evidently, is to draft players who want to play for you. That's the one and only scouting tip that the book serves up over and over.  <br /> <br />In the end, whether you agree with Moneyball or not, it was insightful into the \\"why\\" Beane et al think they way they do. Nothing here was explanatory, it was simply put out by someone upset at Moneyball who wanted to say \\"Me too!\\" <br /> <br />It gets two stars because all things baseball related deserve a read.	2005-10-08

A childhood friend's younger brother has died, apparently of a heart attack. The pacemaker he wore because of a congenital heart defect seems incidental, and yet, his sister questions natural causes as the reason for his death. Claudia agrees to investigate and soon finds herself immersed in a shadier side of Sydney--that of crime boss, Harry Lavender. <br /> <br />Plotting for the book is fairly complex, with a couple of twists and turns; most come to mind, however, before they are carried to their end, with few real surprises. The story requires from the reader several leaps of faith in following Valentine from clues to their interpretations. <br /> <br />More engaging than plot are the characters in the book. Claudia has several sources of information, from the computer expert to a reporter friend, and Detective Carol Rawlings, a school pal now with the police department. On the other side of the coin are associates of Harry Lavender: lowlife small-time crook, Ronny O'Toole; the big Maori with the bigger knife; and Johnny the Jumper, so-named for his method of exacting punishment. <br />  <br />Most enjoyable of all in this book are the descriptions of the Australian city. What Fusilli does for New York City, Day does equally as well for Sydney. I look forward to reading the other three books in this series.	2005-10-08

All the date setting and charts, mil's and trib's made my head spin and just seemed to be a distraction from the heart of the faith.  However, when I was finally forced to tackle it, I (unsurprisingly) found myself in able hands with Grenz.  He is even handed, biblically literate, historically comprehensive and, ultimately, relevant.<br /><br />He conducts biblical and historical surveys of postmillennialism, dispensationalism, historic premillennialism and amillennialism with balance and insight. (I actually found the postmil chapter the most interesting as my unilateral association with it and old line Liberalism was patently discredited).

One suspects that the summer release of \\"Lifeguard\\" was absolutely intended for the beach, and if so, it met its goal!  Although the leading man, Ned Kelly, a college grad drifting along right now as a lifeguard, indeed works at a Palm Springs beach, the story quickly moves into an art heist gone bad that sets our boy into a lam headed for his hometown Boston.  It seems Mr. Kelly, son of a professional thief (apparently not a great one based on living half his life in prison) has some petty crimes on his resume, and looks to score the big one ($1 million) for his share of stealing three priceless paintings from a rich beach resident.  While Ned's four friends break into the house, Ned is running around town setting off house alarms just to occupy the police.  But things go totally sour when Ned is called by one of the friends and waved off.  Just hours later, his four compadres are dead, as is (seemingly unrelated) Ned's new one-day girlfriend; and guess who the leading suspect is?<br /><br />Meanwhile, FBI Agent Ellie Shurtleff, who happens to be an art crimes expert, latched onto Ned but believes his tale of woe and spends the whole book trying to defend and clear him; indeed, he abducts her instead of she apprehending him.  Given this ridiculous implausibility, it was tough to swallow much of the tale.  But as one might presume, The real story of who wanted the paintings and why and why all those people were killed unfolds and the book ends mostly in predictable fashion.\<br /><br />Patterson seems to be pumping out a lot of books in the past few years.  While his Alex Cross novels, which we hasten to note he writes completely by himself (presumably), maintain the quality that keeps JP unfailingly on the best seller list, his use of co-authors for this and many of his other recent novels leads us to believe the money machine is getting more important than giving us consistently great efforts.  While \\"Lifeguard\\" is a typical suspenseful Patterson outing, it's not a story you'll remember for ten minutes after its conclusion.  We'd prefer a few less books and more careful word and plot craft, to warrant keeping JP on our top shelf.

It's books like this that keep non believers away from Christ	This book is a biased look at Christian rock music from a guy who obviously has no concept of what an open mind is.   <br />What makes this book rediculous is that Jeff Godwin singles out rock and roll as a tool of influence used by Satan.  The bible clearly says that Satan was the angel of ALL music.    <br /> <br />Also, many of the hymns in our Sunday hymnals are based on the melodies of old pub songs.  Gospel music is derived from American country/western music which in turn was derived from standard blues scales and song structure...which, ironically, is also where rock and roll comes from...LOOK IT UP.  <br />   <br />Regardless of Satan's role as angelic musician, the church has always used music as an instrument of praise.  If the chuch is going to be hypocritical about music, then maybe it should keep up. <br />As music evolves, the use of the new music styles can also be turned into instruments of praise.    <br />There is absolutely no better way to reach a fan of rock music than to use his own music as a method of spreading the word. <br />The closed-minded view that Rock music is evil and your Gospel music is somehow holy is precisely why the people that would read this book are completely ineffective in bringing young people to Christ.      <br />...oh and by the way... <br />In high school, a \\"new kid\\" at school gave me a tape of a band called \\"The Crucified\\".   That tape introduced me to Christ in a way that 16 years of sunday school never did.  Think about that.	2005-10-08

In many of those cases descriptons on how to get to the trailheads where inaccurate, or if or what parking pass is required at some of the trailheads. But what really is missing is information on the road conditions to the trailheads: I found that many of them can only be accessed with a four wheel drive or high clearance vehicle -- something that would be good to know ahead of timeif you only have a plain old passenger car like I do.

This is a very useful improvement ovet the original edition of this book. I actually found this second edition to be useful in informing the reader about the basics of using the GUI interface to WEKA. I have still found some strange results using WEKA. For example, when using the C4.5 algorithm with boosting, I set the upper confidence limit to .05. WEKA built a small original tree and then ignored my upper confidence setting and built all the rest of the trees ignoring my input value which resulted in extensive trees using, I assume, .25 as the upper confidence limit. Anyway, the book is worth the money if you want to get the most out of WEKA and also want a basic understanding of the theory and algorithms used.	2005-10-08

I knew nothing about this book when I started reading it, but after two pages, I was totally hooked until the end. Even lots of my favorite books have had some dead spots that I just needed to get through, but this didn't at all. <br /> <br />The author is often compared to Neal Stephenson, mostly for good reason. This is like Neal Stephenson at his best with more realistic characters and tech and MUCH more heavily edited. <br /> <br />One thing I particularly loved was how the characters in the book that are supposed to be smart people, actually act like smart people. They are as complex as smart people tend to be in real life and they think a lot about what they are doing, rather than follow the plot structure blindly like robots in a movie. <br /> <br />The author has obviously spent a number of years in the computer industry and describes the people in it with an accuracy and fun insight that comes from more than just research. The technical details of the threat and the social aspects of the conspiracy are also totally plausible and make it really rather creepy.	2005-10-08

However, in the author's defense, there are individuals and movements that would like to both call themselves evangelicals and hold these positions, so they are worth being informed about.<br /><br /> The text focuses on the biblical data with lesser space devoted to philosophical arguments and appeals to church history.  This is not a devotional text (look elsewhere for that).

It is largely this book that provides the foundation of this assessment. Whether one loves Kant or hates him (philosophically, that is), one cannot really ignore him; even when one isn't directly dealing with Kantian ideas, chances are great that Kant is made an impact.<br /><br />Kant was a professor of philosophy in the German city of Konigsberg, where he spent his entire life and career. Kant had a very organised and clockwork life - his habits were so regular that it was considered that the people of Konigsberg could set their clocks by his walks. The same regularity was part of his publication history, until 1770, when Kant had a ten-year hiatus in publishing. This was largely because he was working on this book, the 'Critique of Pure Reason'.<br /><br />Kant as a professor of philosophy was familiar with the Rationalists, such as Descartes, who founded the Enlightenment and in many ways started the phenomenon of modern philosophy. He was also familiar with the Empiricist school (John Locke and David Hume are perhaps the best known names in this), which challenged the rationalist framework. Between Leibniz' monads and Hume's development of Empiricism to its logical (and self-destructive) conclusion, coupled with the Romantic ideals typified by Rousseau, the philosophical edifice of the Enlightenment seemed about to topple.<br /><br />Kant rode to the rescue, so to speak. He developed an idea that was a synthesis of Empirical and Rationalist ideas. He developed the idea of a priori knowledge (that coming from pure reasoning) and a posterior knowledge (that coming from experience) and put them together into synthetic a priori statements as being possible. Knowledge, for Kant, comes from a synthesis of pure reason concepts and experience. Pure thought and sense experience were intertwined. However, there were definite limits to knowledge. Appearance/phenomenon was different from Reality/noumena - Kant held that the unknowable was the 'ding-an-sich', roughly translated as the 'thing-in-itself', for we can only know the appearance and categorial aspects of things.<br /><br />Kant was involved heavily in scientific method, including logic and mathematical methods, to try to describe the various aspects of his development. This is part of what makes Kant difficult reading for even the most dedicated of philosophy students and readers. He spends a lot of pages on logical reasoning, including what makes for fallacious and faulty reasoning. He also does a good deal of development on the ideas of God, the soul, and the universe as a whole as being essentially beyond the realm of this new science of metaphysics - these are not things that can be known in terms of the spatiotemporal realm, and thus proofs and constructs about them in reason are bound to fail.<br /><br />Kant does go on to attempt to prove the existence of God and the soul (and other things) from moral grounds, but that these cannot be proved in the scientific methodology of his metaphysics and logic. This book presents Kant's epistemology and a new concept of metaphysics that involves transcendental knowledge, a new category of concepts that aims to prove one proposition as the necessary presupposition of another. This becomes the difficulty for later philosophers, but it does become a matter that needs to be addressed by them.<br /><br />As Kant writes at the end of the text, 'The critical path alone is still open. If the reader has had the courtesy and patience to accompany me along this path, he may now judge for himself whether, if he cares to lend his aid in making this path into a high-road, it may not be possible to achieve before the end of the present century what many centuries have not been able to accomplish; namely, to secure for human reason complete satisfacton in regard to that with which it has all along so eagerly occupied itself, though hitherto in vain.' This is heavy reading, but worthwhile for those who will make the journey with Kant.h hitherto in vain.' This is heavy reading, but worthwhile for those who will make the journey with Kant.  <br />	2005-10-08

A few weeks ago I went into a bookstore with a couple of friends and just felt like buying a book on impulse, not knowing anything about it and see where it would take me. Selecting the international fiction shelf for my picking, it was Ed McBain's \\"Hark!\\" that got my attention and so I didn't have to think much to bring it home with me. That was the whole point right?<br /><br />From the back cover description, I thought was up to something much like the acclaimed \\"Da Vinci Code\\" but while it has a couple of similarities, this turns out to be a hard-boiled police procedural, something I'm not really used to reading but which turns out to be a refreshing change.<br /><br />To make a long story short, \\"Hark!\\" is the continuation of a huge on-going saga of the 87th precinct which started back in 1956 (!) and has now over fifty titles. Ed McBain must have been one of the most prolifc writers I've ever come across (I can only remember maybe Asimov and Clarke with a bigger throughput) and I'm left wondering why I never heard of him before. I said \\"must have been\\" because I just learned McBain passed away a couple of months ago after fighting a tough battle with cancer. Even if this was only the first work of his I've read, I couldn't help feeling a little sad for this loss. I hate to see people going away like this, but it's happening all the time...<br /><br />As for the book itself, picture this: you got a bunch of policemen in a precinct who go about their daily routine and into the picture comes this intelligent fella who goes by the name of the Deaf Man. In case you didn't know, like I didn't know, the Deaf Man is an old acquaintance of these cops from past novels of the 87th precinct and now he's back to haunt them. He's a smart thug and like every smart thug he doesn't do things conventionally, he has a twisted mind and so spends a lot of time delivering notes to Detective Carella at the precinct with hints about whatever he's planning to do next, basically trying to break their balls. These notes are actually under the form of palindromes, anagrams and Shakespeare quotations which gives them a certain charm.<br /><br />What the Deaf Man does next I'm not going to tell you but it's not the end of the world as we know it either. I found we spend too much time trying to figure out the Deaf Man charades and then the payoff doesn't satisfy and is really open-ended. But then how else do you produce a 50-year saga if you don't leave the threads hanging?<br /><br />The book is definitely a page-turner and despite never having heard of the 87th Precinct before, I soon felt like I knew all the cops. There's a lot of parallel threads going on, none of which really satisfied me in the end, but which were well developed. The characters actually have some depth, are well pictured and they definitely sound like regular people going on their daily routine. It just doesn't fully deliver what it promises but I'm not complaining too much either.<br /><br />May Mr. McBain rest in peace after what seems to have been a well-accomplished writing career.trying to break their balls.

Little Red Riding Hood is reincarnated in this imaginative retelling of a favorite tale, Carmine taught to read by a beloved granny who uses alphabet soup to instruct the child. She started with a spoonful of letters and now Carmine can read a whole bowl. Whenever Granny makes a fresh pot of soup, like today, Carmine is invited for lunch. Before she leaves, Carmine sorts through her clutter for anything she might need on her journey, pencils, paper and paint. Accompanied by her beloved dog, Rufus, Carmine has been known to dilly dally on the way to Granny's house, although she has been warned by her mother that the route is fraught with danger. This time a lurking wolf spots the child, who has stopped to paint a picture for her grandmother, distracted by nature's abundant beauty. Racing ahead... well, you know this story. Luckily for Carmine, her Granny doesn't meet the same fate as the original grandmother, this one hiding in the closet as the hungry wolf gathers an armful of soup bones to take home to his pups. Happily reunited, Carmine, Granny and Rufus sip their soup while admiring Carmine's latest work of art.<br /><br />The artwork in this book is vivid and imaginative, combined with a layout that introduces new vocabulary words used in context with the illustrations. This artist thinks outside the box, using both visual images and language to inspire young readers, cartoon balloons filled with Carmine and the Wolf's dialog as they confront their situations. Words like pluck, dawdle, mimic and nincompoop add alliterative rhythms, balanced with lively drawings, a bright palette accented with every shade of red: scarlet, carmine and fuscia. A multi-level reading experience, Carmine is a fabulous addition to a child's library, a visual and verbal feast as exuberant as its young heroine. Luan Gaines/ 2005.	2005-10-08

Diana Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series is without a doubt my favorite in all fiction. (I consider J. R. R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Ring\\" trilogy to be in a category of its own). I had been hoping for another novel about the fabulous time-traveling Fraser family but thought \\"The Fiery Cross\\" would be the last. Needless to say, when I heard that a sixth book was in the works, I reread my already well-worn copies of the first five installments, and pre-ordered \\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes.\\" I must say that Ms. Gabaldon is the only author I know of who is able to maintain her storyline, the tension and excitement, through thousands of words, and six novels, over a period of fifteen years. She continually invents new adventures, accurately recreates history, and allows her characters and their relationships to grow to extraordinary depth. I can only say BRAVO(!), as she has yet again come up with a winner.<br /><br />As Gabaldon fans know, Claire and James Fraser have weathered more storms than most. They crossed oceans and centuries to make a life together. Readers were first introduced to Jamie and Claire in \\"Outlander,\\" right after Claire made the voyage from peaceful 20th century Scotland to 18th century Scotland and total mayhem. We witnessed passion, love and friendship grow between this couple as they began married life, and experienced adventure, adversity and attempted to alter history. They finally settled in North Carolina along with their daughter Brianna, her husband Roger, their son Jemmie, many of their family members and friends from Scotland, including most of Jamies fellow prisoners from Ardsmuir and hundreds of refugees in exile in the wake of the Jacobite rebellion.<br /><br />Claire, now a beautiful matron in her 50s, spends much of her time utilizing her physician's skills and searching for ways to bring 20th century science to her 18th century practice. James is the founder of the Fraser's Ridge community and acts as an unofficial clan chief to the families who look to him for leadership. Brianna and Roger, and Fergus and Marsali are young couples coping with a heavy daily work load and parenting. This is a period when backbreaking work, from first light to last, is necessary for survival.<br /><br />\\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes\\" opens in the year 1772 on the eve of the American Revolution. Even in the backwoods colony of Fraser's Ridge, NC, people are rebelling at the increased taxation by the British, with no government representation for themselves. Word of the Boston Massacre has reached the Frasers and their neighbors, and, in fact, one of the novel's characters was involved in the event. The American colonies are in turmoil. Tension builds as isolated cabins are burned in the wilderness and families murdered. North Carolina Governor Josiah Martin asks James Fraser to help unite the backcountry population, including the Native Americans, in support of the King. However, Jamie knows about the revolution to come. His wife, Claire, has traveled back in time from the twentieth century, as have his daughter Brianna and her husband. They are well aware that it's only a matter of a few years before the start of the War of Independence.<br /><br />Looming over the Frasers is the threat of a tiny newspaper clipping from The Wilmington Gazette, dated 1776, which Claire discovered before returning to the 18th century. The article reports the destruction of the house on Fraser's Ridge, and the death by fire of James Fraser and all his family. Claire and James know from experience that it is not possible to change or effect future events, but they are determined to do all in their power to prove the newspaper report wrong.<br /><br />While not as good a read as \\"The Outlander,\\" (but what is?), this is a fabulous novel and the historical events portrayed are fascinating. I am from the Northeast and when I studied the American Revolution I usually focused on events in Philadelphia and New England. Ms. Gabaldon gives anotherperspective here, which has motivated me to further explore the history in the southern colonies.<br /><br />The author has an imagination for which I will always be grateful, and she is as skilled a writer as there ever was. She develops characters so that they truly come to life and remain with the reader forever - no small accomplishment. Her ability to capture the essence of a loving relationship, whether between lovers, spouses, parents and children, or friends can easily move her readers to tears. The dialogue is excellent and the wonderful Scottish dialect, interspersed with Gaelic, adds much to the novels' credibility and the readers' enjoyment.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"A Breath of Snow and Ashes.\\" And for those who have not read the other books in the series, do yourselves a huge favor and begin with \\"Outlander\\" and read straight through all five sequels. You will be delighted and richly rewarded.<br /><br />Just a closing note: I know many men who have read and enjoyed these books. These novels are much more than chick lit!!

It seems that the Robicheaux series just keeps churning out brilliance but CRUSADER'S CROSS even exceeds the high expectations set forth by previous installments. Longtime followers of the series will find their favorite Cajun detective still alive and kicking with sidekick Clete Purcel, this time uncovering the secret surrounding the disappearance of a woman fifty years in Dave's past.<br /><br />This book is classic Burke in many ways: the story, the setting, the prose, and more. The fact that this installment is coming along now is ironic, considering how much New Orleans and the Louisiana bayou country has been in the news over the last several months. Everyone has felt a connection to the area and many Robicheaux fans watched the coverage of Hurricane Katrina with their hearts a little heavier because of the connection we feel to the region through these books. The language is beautifully descriptive and the story is one of the finest in the series. We also get to see Dave's half-brother Jimmie, a rare commodity.<br /><br />Clete is classic Clete. Every Robicheaux fan knows of which I speak.<br /><br />The book leaves you breathing a breath of fresh air and you are somewhat disappointed that it has to end. At the same time, you almost feel that the final sentences were the final words in the series.<br /><br />But fear not Dave fans, the new book is already in the works. I, as well as many others, can't wait to read it.	2005-10-08

Much to one's dismay, one finds a whole parade of grief counseling peddlers. Garden variety touchy-feely advice. Precious little for people with brain cells in the right places.<br /><br />That is what makes this Kubler-Ross compilation an absolute treasure of a find. It is intelligent in its narrative of moments one goes through at times of deep sudden loss, and the kinds of things one can do or think to ride the emotional rollercoasters that inevitably ensue. The prose is sane, easy to identity with. There is a rich cornucopia of examples and real life experiences that go to great lengths to cushion the self-doubt one could quite easily feel while indulging in a book on the subject.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this muddle-through read highly enough. A smart, sensitive companion. Look for the paperback if possible, there is one. As you are reading this review, may I also offer to point out that life's curveballs may appear random at times, with very little explanations offered for unpleasant things one has to live through, but life goes on. You will get through it. Best wishes.	2005-10-08

They were all exterminated without mercy.  <br /> <br />Today not a single Indians is found on any of these islands. Similar massacres happened in South, Central and North America.  <br /> <br />In its totality, 97% of this noble race ...(ranging well in the 100 millions)... was wiped out from the face of the earth. Only 3% remains today. Need I say more? <br /> <br />There wasn't a Greater Holocaust or a Greater Genocide of human beings in World History. No other can rightfully compare in magnitude and cruelty. Regretfully so little is said about this Holocaust.  <br /> <br />No cameramen marched into villages to film and document the atrocities committed, no journalists or newspapers wrote about it.  <br /> <br />None of the 20th century media existed. No monuments or parks were dedicated to it, as if man wants to bury his shame. David E. Stannard's book brings it back to our memory and assessment.  <br /> <br />They paid dearly to sastify a lustful greed ... a pound of flesh for a pound of gold...done under the banner of Christianity. A great message of \\"Love thy neighbor as you love thyself\\" was completely igored.  <br /> <br />	2005-10-08

First of all, it only demonstrate six fonts, and while it certainly examines those six fonts in depth, it is still a rather slim offering.  The book is also terribly organized.  It jumps around from subjects to fonts to exercises and back again in a manner that is neither user-friendly nor particularly enlightening.

And I'm not talking about the story itself. I'm talking about what the 13 authors are trying to do to each other! <br />The genre originated wonderfully with the august members of the British Detection Club way back in 1931, in a \\"serial\\" novel in which the various authors contrived ways to skullduggle not only the reader but each other and try to make it almost impossible for the final writer to wrap everything up neatly and tie it with a bowknot. That effort, \\"The Floating Admiral,\\" is still the very best of its type. More recently, it's been done with sparkling wit by the Miami bunch including Carl Hiassen and Dave Barry in a delicious romp entitled \\"Naked Came the Manatee.\\" <br />Now it's been tackled by a baker's dozen of America's female mystery writers. Yes, the plot is silly. Yes, the characters aren't all that fully developed. But who cares? The enjoyment of this book, as the others, is in seeing what each successive writer is doing to skewer what has already been written (without, however, contradicting it) and send the story reeling in a provocatively new direction.

Contrasting scenarios challenge what you think you've already assuredly figured out. <br />It doesn't really matter who winds up having done what to whom. If you're enjoying the wicked twists being perpetrated not by the characters but by their creators, then what you're looking for is how the final writer responds to the challenge of wrapping everything up with no loose ends and no plot spins left twisting in the wind--not even the yellow polkadot bikini! And in this regard, Laurie King shines splendidly. <br />As I closed the book, I was imagining the final dinner party those naughty thirteen were having after they all got to read King's inventive closure, and what a laugh they were enjoying. But the laughter is not at our expense. We share in it.	2005-10-08

I was one of those who watched and read everything I could find, and I admired Ms. Smith.  Not much changed with the publication of the book.

This book allows us the wider vision necessary to understanding who we are in our relationship to God and the Universe.  This book, in its ability to explain Quantum Physics, cosmology, light, singularities, magnetic fields, et al in simple understandable terms, can contribute to the breakthrough needed to remedy many problems in our world today. It is exciting to think that scientific discoveries are bringing the shift in our perception that will ease the myopic, clouded and limited views of God.  That, perhaps it will be science, not religion, that allows us new revelations, bringing greater insights that light our pathway to the higher, holy ground.  After reading this book I am seeing more clearly, even seeing new dimensions, beyond appearances; yes, all is one and we really are made of the stuff of God.

The unusual friendship between Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) and an impressionistic neighbor boy, Joe Connelly, is the crux of Kipling's Jungle Books in Vinton's imaginative tale. In 1892, the newly transplanted writer has settled in Vermont to build his dream house, inspired to write without the exotic distractions of India. Forming the skeleton of his new tale, Kipling finds both landscape and boy a source of inspiration: \\"The cold and the snow were like a revelation, with stark and unspoiled purity he'd never beheld before... here was a place where he could work... where the seasons went from wet to dry and the dead never seemed to stay dead.\\"<br /><br />Joe's imagination is caught by Kipling's words, the tale of the boy, Mowgli, yet forming in the author's mind. With Joe as inspiration, man and boy confer, Kipling sharing the bits of adventure yet to be written, the boy taking ownership, ignited by such freedom, the color and warmth of India, the lush jungle so different from the icy scene of Vermont. Reaching into the Vermont landscape, Kipling builds Mowgli's world, peopled with all its enchantments, dreaming Joe into the verdant fantasy, while the boy's parents watch their son with chagrin, determined to recapture him. The two families could not be more different, yet Kipling and Joe form a bond that transcends circumstances in Vinton's fictionally believable account of a creative endeavor and a budding friendship. The prose is striking, contrasting the stark Vermont countryside with the India of Kipling's youth, the tales of Scheherazade and the burgeoning adventure of a boy raised by wolves.<br /><br />Joes' father, Jack, is an Irishman come to America to escape the famine, almost killed while working on the railroad, now toiling on his own small farm for meager sustenance. A man burdened by disappointment, the ideals he once nurtured dashed by the reality of hard labor, Jack finds solace in his jug at night, but the drink turns him bitter, shamed that his wife, Addie, does washing and ironing for their strange neighbors, the Kipling's. Jack doesn't trust Kipling, views him the same as the wealthy landowners who passed the starving Irish peasants without a nod. What can such a man do when his son is threatened by the fascination of new ideas, called to a world so unlike what his father can provide? In his wanderings, a conflicted Joe has come face to face with his own limitations, Kipling's words a heady drug that leads him into the dark and unforgiving night: \\"How foolish to think that he was heading forward... when in fact all he's done is wind his way back to another story's beginnings, one that leads only... to dull compromise and sharp regret.\\"<br /><br />Vinton has brought all together in a fierce, magical tale, filled with the intimate details of Kipling's life, his pampered childhood; his removal from the security of mother and home, placed in a hostile foster home until his mother rescues him and his sister; Kipling's friendship with Wolcott, who  introduces the author to his sister, Carrie. After her brother's untimely death, Carrie marries Kipling, now pregnant with their first child. Vinton's brilliant prose introduces the reader to the inventiveness of the writer's world and the power of a fertile imagination unrestricted by geography, fashioning a compelling story from Kipling's rich history, building on the writer's life with layers of her own imaginings, the pages scattered with images that transcend time and place in the heady prose of the creative mind.

In the book the Dalai Lama relates Buddhist philosophy and science to western metaphysics and science. It is a broad attempt to reconcile modern science with spirituality (especially Buddhist).<br /><br />In the middle of the book the Dalai Lama relates a question that he asked at one of his biannual conferences on science. He saw that the metaphysics behind western science was reductionism . Higher level systems are described in terms of lower level principles. Systems are describes in terms of laws that relate lower level concepts. So chemistry is explained as a consequence of underlying atomic and molecular physics. The Dalai Lama asked the question if higher level systems could ever affect the lower level principles by which they are constituted. The assembled scientists answered that there could be no such interaction and the Dalai Lama wrote that he did not pursue the question.<br /><br />In his discussion in the book I could see why this question came to the Dalai Lama. In fact, I can see it as a primary reason why he pursues his interest in science. The Dalai Lama indicated that compassion was the one the great truths about the universe. If the universe is at its basis controlled by the cold inanimate laws of quantum physics, then what is the place of compassion? How can it be a truth of the universe if it is found no where as a fundamental principle?<br /><br />The answer that I see for this question is a rejection of reductionism at least as I understand the term. There are certain basic principles that do not manifest themselves until a sufficient level of system complexity is reached. So the principles behind evolution (notable the `selection of the fittest' and the `inheritance of acquired traits'), are basic but cannot be found in physics. `Selection of the fittest' requires at least a biological systems and the `inheritance of acquired traits' requires a social system.<br /><br />Inherent in the ideas of evolution is the principle of competition. Species (or genes) compete to survive. However competition quickly breeds cooperation. With cooperation, individuals can specialize and as a group derive advantages that cannot be achieved by a single individual alone. Cooperation taken into a social setting extends into altruism, empathy and compassion. These are not mere surface phenomena. These are basic principles that provide for advantages in evolution. It is no coincidence that the only species known to have a perception of its place in the universe regards compassion as one of the truths defining that place.<br /><br />With the level of system complexity needed for evolution to be operative comes the possibility of the Baldwin effect . This is an evolutionary principle that an evolutionary advantage of a characteristic can affect the evolution of that characteristic. So take the example of cooperation. Acting at a group level, cooperative individuals will have an advantage. They will have a selection advantage in reproduction. Thus individuals without the genetic capacity will disappear and the population will become more and more cooperative. So a principle operating at the social level can have effects at the biological level. The success of a cooperative social group will create cooperative individuals. A higher level principle will change the underlying system of which it is constituted. In the same way compassion being at higher level than cooperation reinforce the effect.<br /><br />So this is an answer to the Dalai Lama's question. Higher level principles can have an effect on the operation of lower level principles. All that is needed is a system of appropriate complexity. So compassion is a basic principle of the universe. It is a basic principle that shapes the universe in its own image.r /> <br />Inherent in the ideas of evolution is the principle of competition. Species (or genes) compete to survive.

I found this books as I searched this site for new works from authors I respect. My introduction to the book was as a reader of the reviews on this site.    I'll admit it, I was confused.  How could Sue Halpern write so haphazardly or gratuitously as some  reader comments suggest.  I usd those reviews as guides through the book and found none of the disappointment one would anticipate after reading such negative stuff.    I'm no critic.  I'm a reader, and I am also an Adirondacker of sorts.  I think that what might have startled some readers is the gentle and flowing Ms. Halpern is not so gentle in this novel.  It does flow well, in my estimation.  What is missed is what makes her writing work time and time again, the quality that prevails in all her writing: honest portrayal of subject matter.     If you are looking to be swept away into bucholic bliss in a quaint Adirondack setting, run from this book. If you are looking for a compelling story that is so absolutely true to what life can really be like in a small Adirondack town, buy this book!    Sue caputures what is a particular lonliness and longing that casts its shadow as often as not on the youth of Adriondack towns living  far from what most of us understand as community life. The characters, every one of them, are portrayed with honesty and can easily be found in almost any small, remote town.  Not fun stuff, but the real McCoy.    She doesn't pretend for a moment to lead anywhere other than the theme of hardness, from the title to the various themes that set each chapter, she leads us to despair and hope and back again to the inevidible hardness that is created by not being able to get away.    Some were unhappy with plots undeveloped, for example the fact that the tree house goes unexamined after its miraculous finding.  That wasn't,in my estimation, undeveloped or faulty.  It was the undeniablilty of the randomness, the wandering of existence and circumstance of such a place.     The scary part for me is the absolute possibility of the brutalness of the ending of the book.  It wasn't gratuitous or unnecessary.  It was born of hardness, of the rigidness of boredom and the desire for excitement and change...just about any change in otherwise listless lives.     And as for the ending...don't forget, Cuzzy ends up knocking on that door (you'll have to read it to know where I am going).  His time with Tracy was one of growth and even through the tragedy of a brutal loss of life he is lead to a greater knowledge of himself.  To me, the ending can be taken two ways.  One of a continued hardness,of Cuzzy capitulating to the hopelessness of isolation in a small town.  But how I read it was as a positive ending. Cuzzy is willing to open up, to take a chance, to see that his life has meaning (thank you Tracy) and that maybe he can being those things he never would have discoveres without Tracy's presence to bear on his life and that of his family.    Buy this book.  It is a good read.  It is clear and well written. The juxtaposition of the beautiful Adirondacks with hard realities and the longings created by  being so far removed from everyday America is an honest chronicle of desire and disaster.  It could as easily have been called a documentary as a novel. Its power lies in what it reveals to any reader believing that the Adirondacks is only of beauty and peace.  Great book.	2005-10-08

We're all familiar with that overused idea of how no-matter-how-different-we-look-from-one-another-we-can-all-be-friends.  This thought has inspired some of the vilest treacle imaginable and has undoubtedly poisoned the tender little minds of our youth for years.  This isn't to say that the message shouldn't be taught, though.  It just needs to be taught well.  Enter, \\"Guji Guji\\".  The book looks at first like an overworn idea done to death yet again.  Then you actually read it through.  Rather than overworn, the book is raucously original.  It's sweet and funny and even reading its name aloud to small children causes them to squeal with laughter.  Few books can claim half so much.<br /><br />Our story begins with an egg.  An egg in transit.  As mother duck sits reading a book, she does not notice that a particularly large brown egg has rolled down the hill and into her nest.  When the eggs hatch beneath her, she names each baby accordingly.  The last and largest egg hatches and a baby crocodile emerges (hands triumphantly over his head) with a cry of \\"Guji Guji\\".  And that becomes his name.  Lest you think this is some slight adaptation of the \\"Ugly Duckling\\" story, you couldn't be further from the truth.  Not only is Guji Guji accepted into society, but he's a whiz at everything.  \\"Guji Guji always learned more quickly than the others.  He was bigger and stronger too\\".  Such bliss cannot remain entirely uninterrupted, however, and one day the little crocodile is confronted by big, mean, hungry, adult crocodiles.  They attempt to convince Guji Guji to sacrifice his duck family to them since he is truly a bad crocodile at heart.  Such arguments fall flat with the canny youngster, however, and by the tale's end he and his adopted family have defeated the crocodiles and for Guji Guji, \\"every day he became a stronger and happier 'crocoduck'\\".<br /><br />In an afterword placed on the book's back cover, author/illustrator Chih-Yuan Chen mentions that he was inspired to write this story after witnessing a friend of his who was Korean yet adopted into a non-Korean family in America.  Says Chen, \\"The birth of every single child is a miracle, worthy of our respect\\".  If \\"Guji Guji\\" is an ode to such thinking, then it is quite an effective ode indeed.  The story (who's translator is left unknown and only the mysterious Hsin Yi Publications is credited) is a wonderful one.  Just the same, it would have been easy enough to ignore had it not been accompanied by Chen's remarkable illustrations.  These are light-hearted and fun pictures.  Guji Guji, toy duck on a string forever in tow, is so good natured and adorable and you understand the ducks' acceptance of him completely.  There are remarkable little details in this book as well.  Ones that you might miss even on a second or third reading.  These include the black crow that perpetually accompanies the bad crocodiles, or the fact that the ducks are balancing rocks on their heads when they walk out onto the bridge.<br /><br />Obvious pairing with this book might be, \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" (though I've never much cared for the story) or even the delightful \\"Mrs. Chicken and the Hungry Crocodile\\" by Won-Ldy Paye.

A class act for the preschool set.a stronger and happier 'crocoduck'\\".   <br />  <br />In an afterword placed on the book's back cover, author/illustrator Chih-Yuan Chen mentions that he was inspired to write this story after witnessing a friend of his who was Korean yet adopted into a non-Korean family in America.  Says Chen, \\"The birth of every single child is a miracle, worthy of our respect\\".  If \\"Guji Guji\\" is an ode to such thinking, then it is quite an effective ode indeed.  The story (who's translator is left unknown and only the mysterious Hsin Yi Publications is credited) is a wonderful one.  Just the same, it would have been easy enough to ignore had it not been accompanied by Chen's remarkable illustrations.  These are light-hearted and fun pictures.  Guji Guji, toy duck on a string forever in tow, is so good natured and adorable and you understand the ducks' acceptance of him completely.  There are remarkable little details in this book as well.  Ones that you might miss even on a second or third reading.  These include the black crow that perpetually accompanies the bad crocodiles, or the fact that the ducks are balancing rocks on their heads when they walk out onto the bridge. <br />  <br />Obvious pairing with this book might be, \\"The Ugly Duckling\\" (though I've never much cared for the story) or even the delightful \\"Mrs. Chicken and the Hungry Crocodile\\" by Won-Ldy Paye.  Still, \\"Guji Guji\\" trumps all of these in terms of spirit and presentation.  A class act for the preschool set. <br />	2005-10-08

I also find that McKay is somewhat unclear in his analysis of the causes of a particular event.  He shifts around without ever establishing a main cause:  something that can be very annoying when you see the question, \\"what was the main cause of...\\" on the test.  In addition, the author has a great talent for dragging and extending his points long after he's finished explaining them, and then covering other equally important topics in two sentences.  Well, I guess that's all concerning the style this book is written in.  If you're reading this book to study for the AP exam, there's probably not that much wrong with it, if of course, you can focus solely on the factual parts.	2005-10-08
US	14119895	R2FJHIMVIUTWRY	1413726356	531563296	It Never Stops	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Graphic, Yet Poignant and Truthful	\\"It Never Stops\\" <br />By: Barbie Durbin <br /> <br />Barbie Durbin writes of her own personal journey through the horrors of domestic violence.  However, her book does not contain documentation of repeated incidents, which continue until the book  is concluded.  Instead, she writes using a refreshing and unique method.   Barbie writes from the perspective of an author who is meeting, and helping, many victims of domestic violence.   <br /> <br />Barbie holds book signings, back-to-back, as well as visiting abuse shelters and women's prisons.  Each time, she meets one particular victim that stands out to her in the crowd.  They usually bring up one of the chapters in her book that aided them in leaving, or considering leaving.  A conversation usually follows, as Barbie remembers and discusses Brady, her abuser.  On one incident, in her book, she is visiting women in a prison.  During this time, she listens to their individual stories, and offers her compassion, and her understanding, in a way that left me in tears.  <br /> <br />The factor that most intrigued me with Barbies book, \\"It Never Stops,\\" is how she is able to discuss so many truths of domestic violence and its effects, while intertwining her own personal story into all of it.  The storyline flows smoothly, and though hard reading because of the topic, is still easy to follow along. <br /> <br />Barbie Durbin discusses factors of abuse that many will not dare to speak out.  However, through her tenacity and her courage, she is able to reach out and touch the heart of those who either have endured it, or are currently enduring it.  She speaks of the cycles of abuse, the truth of Battered Wife Syndrome, the endless threats, the realities of why so many do not leave their abuser, the suicidal thoughts the victim feels when at their most desperate moments, the self-blame, and the injustices of the legal system. <br /> <br />Barbie is a writer that is able to include such a broad range of truths pertaining to domestic violence in her book, while speaking compassionately to the heart of each reader as an individual.  Her book is one that I will recommend to all those whom I personally meet, because it is not a book of personal tragedies, but rather an offering of support from one who is a companion along a journey so dark and tragic, that it leaves most feeling utterly alone.  Through her writings, Barbie dispels these fears. <br /> <br />She offers her story as a gift of compassion to other victims of abuse, as well as the gift of knowing that they are not alone.  However, perhaps her greatest gift through her book, \\"It Never Stops,\\" is the manner in which she bravely encourages countless others, through bold truths and undying compassion, to leave their abuser and take back not only their life, but also their voice.   <br />	2005-10-08

However, there is very little in this novella that compares favorably to the writers King expresses such admiration for. <br /> <br />The entire story involves two elderly newspapermen relating an unsolved mystery to a young female intern. The mystery itself is curious and somewhat interesting to ponder, but the brief length of the novel and the context in which it is written--essentially a long three-person dialogue--prevents much in the way of detail, character development, or motive. The idea, apparently, is for us to appreciate the mysteries of life, and recognize that reality is more complex than the standard detective novel with few clean wrap-ups. Towards this end, there is no resolution to the novel. What is more frustrating is the scarcity of information available for us to ponder. We know far more about the storytellers than the subject of the mystery, so how are we supposed to play with theories or hypotheses? <br /> <br />As always, King focuses on setting place and defining characters. In this case, however, I found the asides and tangents annoying; if the book is going to be less than 200 pages, I would have liked more of it devoted to plot or details about the victim, rather than repeated comments about the young woman's attempts to impress the newsmen and their fondness for her. It is a fast read, but not a particularly enjoyable one.	2005-10-08

Books	5	2	6	N	N	A highly enjoyable work of popular history	This is an eminently readable, well-written and researched book on the Boxer Rebellion; a true treasure for those interested in the rebellion and a very good work of popular history in general.<br /><br />Diana Preston traces the incident from the factors that led up to the incident that transfixed the world: through the outbreak of violence against foreigners in China, the tense sieges in Peking and Tientsin, and the eventual formation of a coalition of nations (a heretofore unseen thing) to save the besieged. Finally, she ends by looking at the consequences of the rebellion, and its effects both on China and on the world at large.<br /><br />As for accusations that the book only looks at the Boxer Rebellion from an imperialist, racist viewpoint, I find them specious. Preston certainly has no qualms about exposing the callous ways the Chinese were treated by many of these foreign interlopers, and shows how these attitudes led to resentments that eventually found form in mob violence.<br /><br />It does tend to focus on the accounts of foreigners within China - especially Europeans - but on the other hand, that's because there are many more of their accounts available. There are so many firsthand accounts by Europeans, it sometimes seems that every single foreigner under siege kept a diary. (And, the fact that my great-great-aunt was one of those under siege - and kept a diary to her experiences - attests to that.)<br /><br />The major players in the Boxer Rebellion were the foreigners under attack and the Boxers themselves, and sadly firsthand accounts from the Boxer perspective are much rarer than from Europeans, so Preston was forced to turn to the foreign perspective.<br /><br />I'd certainly recommend this to anyone interested in history of this era, and for anyone who is specifically interested in the Boxer Rebellion or related events I would say it's a must-have.	2005-10-08

It's a great tool to help people think, act and have an impact beyond the narrow scope of their specific responsibilities. It helps my clients look at their companies through a big picture window, and helps them see how they can impact the entire company from their current position. I use it to challenge leaders to overcome their inertia, fear and company culture and to see themselves as teachers and catalysts for changing their entire organization. <br /> <br />The drawback is that many of the business leaders and business stories profiled are dated. The benefit is that each chapter has a page and a half of reading and another page of questions for the reader to answer about their own company, and their own leadership skills. It creates an effective, introspective approach to changing the company by changing oneself and by teaching others.  <br /> <br />I find the book to be very powerful when used in a coaching relationship.  <br />Tom Nugent <br />Grosse Pointe MI	2005-10-08

Bombarded daily by gimmicks and promises of `the fountain of youth,' women concerned about anti-aging treatment need the knowledge and expertise of a seasoned professional. And that is where Dr. Brooke R. Seckel's new book, Save Your Face: The Truth About Facial Aging, Its Prevention, and Cure comes in. <br /> Dr. Seckel, a plastic surgeon and Assistant Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School, is an internationally recognized expert in the field of facial rejuvenation.

How does one discern the evidence from the marketing?  Dr. Seckel's new book answers this question in a straightforward manner, providing important information for the lay reader and medical professional alike.

It belongs on the shelf with the best of the best of martial art books.<br /><br />Historical information on the origin of martial arts is all too scarce  and suspect, but the authors succeed in shedding light onto this elusive subject. Howard Reid and Michael Croucher committed themselves to exhaustive research and extensive travels in order to observe and interview both students and masters of numerous martial arts systems. They provide readers with valuable insights into the origin of martial arts and where these arts stand at the present time. It is to their credit that they were able to accomplish this task and present the reader with a wealth of knowledge; all condensed into a mere 223, very readable, pages.<br /><br />Their writing is clear and intelligent and follows the historical timeline of the oriental fighting arts, such as the ancient art of Kalaripayit, Shaolin Temple boxing, kung fu, karate, Jujutsu/Jujitsu, Filipino arts and the many forms that derived from them. The authors also cover some of the weapons used in the fighting arts, especially the cultural significance and utility of the Japanese samurai.  They write of the importance of Buddhism, philosophy, meditation, kata (formal exercise), tradition, culture and much, much more. The book is well-presented and profusely illustrated with drawings, paintings, and photographs. \\"The Way of the Warrior: The Paradox of the Martial Arts\\" can also serve as a reference book.<br /><br />\\"The Way of the Warrior: The Paradox of the Martial Arts\\" is not a how-to book of self-defense.

I think it unlikely because they were released within a couple years of each other.  The plot is very similar: a group of boys and girls are stranded with no hope of rescue and have to learn to govern themselves.  In Lord of the Flies, the students are prepubescent (to avoid the \\"hormone\\" issue) while Heinlein tackles it head-on: these are hale and hearty men and women from 16 to 22 who are sent on a survival test (because it's science fiction, on another world).  They are allowed whatever they want on the test, but the best students know their best weapon is between their ears, and go through mainly with knives and other non-perishable material.  However, their \\"warp gate\\" home never materialises at the end of the test, and they have to eke out an existence, assuming catastrophe at home has left them stranded forever. <br /> <br />Overall, I think Heinlein deals with the situation far more elegantly (and realistically!) than Golding. The point of both books is not whether they make it home, but how they adapt to their situation.  They are trapped more irrevocably than the island-dwellers in Lord of the Flies ever could be - a way gate requires an atomic pile to drive it.  The kids set decide to set up a \\"colony\\" and make the best of their situation.  Heinlein allows them to dislike each other, to fight, to marry, and in every way act like real people.  Sure, they still talk in early Heinleinese (they sound like they escaped from the set of Leave it to Beaver), but this was originally conceived as a juvenile.  The first few chapters are the worst for this - once the hero lands in the new world for the start of his test, Heinlein changes tone to a more readable and less saccharine style.  There are also some weird inconsistencies at the beginning, such as the students being unwilling (or unable) to form teams for the duration of the test - wouldn't you be stupid not to form a team? <br /> <br />However, once the story starts going and the kids start organising themselves into a society, Heinlein does a masterful job of protraying a realistic and interesting resolution to the problem.  Alliances shift, people don't like each other but get along because they have to (or die), people pair off in marriage, some are sexist or racist, etc.  Heinlein does tend to philosophise in his books, but it's mercifully absent (for the most part) here - he lets the situation and the characters speak for themselves.  It makes for a fast read (the book is only 200 pages anyways), but an enjoyable one.  It's somewhere at the level of Starship Troopers and Double Star for weight of ideas and level of activity (there is no sex per se and little violence), but probably does not contain the level of insight of these two.  Having said that, it's certainly above the young adult stories like Between Planets (for which I have an irrational love) and Rocket Ship Galileo.	2005-10-08

I totally agree with the review from above (i.e., (i) Debt sucks. Don't get into it. Buy with cash; (ii) here's how to payoff debt: Concentrate on the smallest debt first. Pay what you can on it, over the minimum payment. Once the smallest debt is gone, add that former payment to the next outstanding debt payment...and so on...and so on (the \\"debt snowball\\"); (iii) after all debts are gone, set aside 3-6 months of expenses (emergency fund); (iv) after the emergency fund, pay off the house and start investing).  That's the plan the book offers folks.<br /><br />I don't criticize the advice at all.  I've heard it from multiple sources.  If fact, I read the above-quoted review before purchasing the book.  I bought the book notwithstanding, because I was looking for some motivation to help me implement it.<br /><br />There is some good motivational stuff here, but not $16.00 worth.  I'm torn, because I think the basic rules he puts forth are sound, and I think that there is some value in the motivational stuff, but I guess it just wasn't as robust as I was hoping for.<br /><br />Bottom line.  The book is overpriced for what it offers.	2005-10-08

But the first two sections can be skipped by most people.  Section one, \\"The Encircled River\\" is about the Kobruk River, and section two, \\"What they Were Hunting For\\" is a funny tale of the defunct effort to establish a new Alaskan capital city.    Section three, titled \\"Coming into the Country\\" describes the people and region of Eagle, population 100 plus a loose scattering of rural homesteaders.  The time is the late 1970s when Alaskan lands are being divided up into national parks, native american, state, federal and private lands.  McPhee seems to have interviewed about everybody in Eagle to get a cross section of views -- most of them anti-government and libertarian. He probes deep into the Alaska psyche by simply recording what people told him.        What of the homesteaders?  I admire their individuality and hardiness -- but their bulldozers and airplanes seem incompatible with living simply in the woods.  Someone once said that the greatest boon to homesteaders was food stamps; thus their lifestyle is more than a bit artificial and dependent upon there being very few people inhabiting large areas of land.  On the other hand, do the \\"posey sniffers\\" (as they call environmentalists) have the right to dictate to Alaskans how they conduct themselves and what they do with their land?  Would New Yorkers on Fifth Avenue resent Alaskan advice on the management of Central Park?      The struggle between the environmentalists and the Alaskans continues to this day.  In the little town of Wrangell last summer, the Greenpeace ship \\"Arctic Sunrise\\" paid a call and was promptly slapped with a summons for violating environmental laws.  Greenpeace fled the scene, but was convicted of failing to have an \\"oil spill prevention plan,\\" which seems a serious omission by an outfit that protests oil spills for a vocation.       I'd like to see an update of McPhee's book.  What's happened to the homesteaders he interviewed?  I suspect that most of them have long since abandoned their cabins and returned to civilization, possibly to be replaced by a new group seeking the solace in the wilderness that is the goal of both homesteaders and posey sniffers, each in his own way.  This is a good book of objective reporting which both groups can enjoy.             Smallchief	2005-10-08

The idea is to transform the PC into a digital media centre. Now, to be sure, there has been a lot of hype about this kind of thing, from vendors. Here, you can see for yourself what is easily achievable by an average or new PC user.<br /><br />Many of the comments in the first part of the book are directed towards a reader who might already have been taking traditional photos for years. (Decades?)  Bond explains a photo editing package called PhotoShow. This can trivially remove redeye from your photos of people that you took with a flash, for example. With traditional photos, redeye was a constant affliction to be endured. But now, it is remarkably easy to remove. PhotoShow has many other features, of course. Like annotating a photo with text. Or rescaling and rotating the photo.<br /><br />Later parts of the book discuss manipulating audio and video. Not surprisingly, these operations are more intricate than simply editing single images. But Bond explains how, with the right software, you can also understand and apply these ideas.	2005-10-08

Take some time and view the reviews by lowest rating first.  The title of my review says it all for me.  In an \\"interview\\" in my version, the author says she ended the book the way she did because \\"this isn't an easy book ... and there are no easy answers.\\"  In my opinion, she chose the easiest answer of all.  After dangling different scenarios that a final choice might bring, she lets every single character off the hook in the end.  No one has to make a choice at all - \\"fate\\" does.  Bull!  In real life, a real choice would have to be made.  The whole book is about making a very tough decision.  Then poof! Golly gee, here's the big whammo twist ending, make sure you cry now!  But no one has to decide. That's the cop out.   <br /> <br />I agree with other extremely well-written reviews that the popping from character to character is too much and confusing.  The author has a point-of-view problem.  Worse, the emotions come from a dictionary with as much depth.  Did we cover it all?  A is for anger, B is for bitterness, C is for confusion. . . I knew I was being manipulated. <br /> <br />I began to skim, a bad sign, tired of the tediousness of it all and supremely irritated at those points I was supposed to stop and gasp about what a great analogy/metaphor/poignant point the author was making.  Don't make me aware you're writing - sweep me along. <br /> <br />I had to read this because I am part of a book group.  Otherwise, I'd have thrown it in the trash early, and I never do that to books.	2005-10-08
US	24296683	R2BDDA9CQ6NU5W	0770429211	324388859	Throwaway Daughter	Books	2	5	6	N	N	Over-rated	This book must be read as a fictional story. Unfortunately, many readers will come away thinking that they are now more informed on how international adoption in China results. An analogy would be thinking that \\"true love\\" was illustrated through a Harlequin romance novel. <br /> <br />As an adoptive mother of two girls from China, I read this book initially with anticipation that this might be a book that I would introduce to them. Unfortunately, it is the author's romanticized, sanitized version of how female infants come to be abandoned by their birth parents and subsequently adopted by foreigners. This book should be read after one reads \\"A Bitter Leaf in the Wind\\", the author's autobiography which details how she came to her decision to leave her own 9-year-old daughter to pursue a relationship with a married American man, William Bell (who also had children). Then perhaps one could appreciate that this novel (i.e. Throwaway Daughter) is possibly the author's way of assuaging her own guilt for abandoning her own daughter \\"for better opportunities.\\" Unfortunately, the opportunity was for the author herself, not her own child. This is quite unlike the situation whereby these foundlings are left so that better opportunities could be had for these children. <br /> <br />This book is entertaining in following the path of one searching for oneself through looking for one's roots, but is definitely not meant to be educational about the complex issue of adoption. Read it with this in mind.  <br /> <br />For more factual account of Chinese adoption, I would recommend \\"Wanting a Daughter, Needing a Son\\" by Kay Ann Johnson. <br />	2005-10-08

The common link, which I find very noble and inspiring is the Orpheus chain of music that bonds all the guests together, through Roxanne, the accompanist and the piano they are connected to one another.<br /><br />They sit down, terrorists and captors alike in a glass prison as the days flow into months the most magical and unique bonds are formed between all in this highly fragile and impossible real situation.<br /><br />The novel centres mainly on Mr. Katsumi, Roxanne Cross, another Japanese businessman and one or two of the terrorists (sorry I've forgotten the name, I read it quite a while ago!)<br /><br />It's a gratifying insight into human nature, that trapped away from the rest of the world, perhaps all our masks can be shed and there is a feeling that the friendships and bonds formed here are more permanent than anything we have experienced. Not even able to speak a common language, they communicate through music, miming at times to each other or playing their feelings on the grande piano. As time slips by, friendship blossoms to love...enemies slip away...and the tower of Babel that stood so firmly surrounding each person gradually disappears as the translator (another Japanese) helps terrorists and dignitaries alike to engage them in the thing that keeps most of us human: contact and the forming of relationships.<br /><br />However peaceful this paradise might at times seem, there is always a sense that the bubble could, at any time, burst open and that this happiness is at best temporary and almost an alien emotion in our society.

The main character Bullet, a high school track star and an obstinate loner, is a racist. This is all right, as the book is set in the sixties. However, the protagonist does not noticeably change by the end of the book. He has had a new wrinkle put in his ideas about race, but he is pretty much the same personality that began the book. Whether this bothers you or not depends on your idea of an effective story and intriguing protagonist. <br />	2005-10-08

Haven't you wondered what Sam Vimes really looks like? How about Lord Vetinari, or Rincewind, or the Nac Mac Feegle, or those wacky witches of Lancre? \\"The Art of Discworld\\" brings together artist Paul Kidby's renderings of the wonders of Discworld. Filled with both color paintings and black-and-white sketches, this book brings Discworld alive. Kidby's works are not only painstaking in their detail, but they faithfully capture every nuance of the characters as described in the books.<br /><br />In addition to the artwork, there is also running commentary by Terry Pratchett on the many people, creatures, and places in Discworld. He provides interesting new insights on the conception and evolution of his creations and describes how his mental visualization of them compares with Kidby's execution. Kidby also adds his own comments on why he depicts the characters the way he does.<br /><br />There are so many treasures in this book! There's Death dressed as the Hogfather. There's Angua in her human and wolf forms. There are depictions of the Librarian that show the man within the orangutan skin. There's a sketch of Twoflower that's a perfect rendition of the first Discworld tourist. Let's not forget the cosmos-scarred Great A'Tuin, bearing the weight of four elephants and a flat planet on his mighty back. I could go on and on, but I won't.

Berlin is a fallen acropolis.  Bernhard's wife Kirsten works at Johnny's American Bar.  She had been a school teacher.  Bernhard Gunther was a Soviet prisoner of war.  His ability to speak Russian is useful to his work of private investigation in the aftermath of the Second World War.      He travels from Berlin to Potsdam because he is handling a case for Dr. Novak.  Dr. Novak is paying him in coal.  On the journey Bernhard has to give up his coat to a Russian.  When a war has been fought a city consists of its women.  Hunger dulls the wits and blunts the memory.  The Russians have an officially licensed black market in their sector of Berlin!      Bernhard's wife has access to the PX.  Her friendships bother Bernhard.  Gunther, with various police personnel, had been drafted into an Action Group operating in White Russia.  Not wishing to be part of the mass execution squads, Bernhard sought service at the front.  He was transferred to the War Crimes Bureau in Berlin.      Bernie travels to Vienna to investigate the case of Emil Becker, a cigarette seller, among other things.  The Central Cemetary in Vienna is larger than some towns.  Most Austrians don't like Berliners.  Becker is accused of murdering Linden.  Bernie links up with an American, Belinsky, supposedly of the counter-intelligence corps, to solve the crime for his client who faces the death penalty.  Belinsky is from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York.  It seems that Linden had had contact with some amateur Nazi hunters, the Drexlers.      A mysterious German group, simply known as the org, is connected to the crime Bernie is investigating. Bernhard Gunther is pleased to receive a letter from his wife who, it seems, misses him greatly.  Agents spirit his wife out of Berlin before she is caught permanently in the Russian sector.      The plot turns on the use of double agents and is very exciting.  The atmosphere of the story is suitably dark, considering the era and the circumstances of Germany and Austria in defeat and occupation.	2005-10-08

So far, I have made several recipes, all of which did not disappoint.  However, be warned: this book is not the best for a beginner or novice cook.  As other reviews mentioned, some of the recipes are not accurate in their measurements, but if you have the knowledge and familiarity to recognize when a recipe doesn't sound quite right, you can fix the situation before it becomes a problem.  An example--the Savory Pot Pie is DELICIOUS but the crust recipe calls for 1 cup of oil!  I have NEVER seen a pie crust recipe call for so much oil.  I cut the measurement down to 3-4 Tablespoons oil and kept all the other measurements the same and ended up with an easy to work, smooth and delicious dough (roll it out on wax paper to make it easier).  I would recommend using this book after you've developed some confidence in the kitchen because you just never know when you'll run across a recipe with mistakes in it.  Once you can navigate the book with confidence, you should not be disappointed.  Delicious!	2005-10-08

Books	5	7	7	N	N	"Retired" High-tech manager	Two years ago, I \\"retired\\" from a high-tech company in the Silicon Valley at 58. This was a forced situation that was not possible to avoid. With the cash I received as a parachute I decided to really retire and not look back. In just one year I came to realize that this is a pipe dream. I must get another job that paid me almost the same salary and continue until I can no longer do it. I think I need another ten years to protect my golden years. During the past year I tried responding to all kinds of jobs but this was a waste of time. No one was hiring, and even now, people with semiconductor experience are in trouble. Reading Rehired, not Retired, gave me some ideas of how to reinvent. Using the tools in the book I have now become a process quality control engineer at a local biotech company. I was so hung up on my old background that I forgot who I was and merely focused on what I did. This book opened my eyes to that possibility and after taking couple of certification courses I was qualified to apply and now I am employed again. Thanks for a great idea in the book on how to reinvent. <br /> <br />	2005-10-08

Do you praise employees who sit at their desks and work for hours at a time without a break? Do you measure engagement in work by how long a person persists at a task without stopping? If so, Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz would tell you to change your ways. The authors are founders of and executives at LGE Performance Systems, an executive training program based on athletic coaching programs. Their full engagement training system embodies the methods of interval or periodical training used by elite athletes to maximize performance capacity. The authors urge us to approach our work activities like a sprinter, not a marathoner, balancing stress and recovery. <br /> <br />Loehr and Schwartz state the essence of their system in this passage: \\"Balancing stress and recovery is critical not just in competitive sports, but also in managing energy in all facets of our lives. Emotional depth and resilience depend on active engagement with others and with our own feelings.\\" A recent Gallup poll has confirmed suspicions that the majority of workers are not deeply engaged in their work. At the same time, we keep hearing about the intense pressures on executives and resulting problems of burnout. Pushing ourselves and others to do more for longer won't work. We will reach full engagement, say Loehr and Schwartz when we skillfully manage energy in all dimensions: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.  <br /> <br />Full engagement comes when we are physically energized, mentally focused, emotionally connected, and spiritually aligned. The authors explain what each of these requires and say that the most fundamental source of energy is physical, while the most significant is spiritual. Unfortunately, most of us are undertrained physically and spiritually and overtrained mentally and emotionally.  <br /> <br />To build ourselves up to a level of full engagement requires realizing that fully engaged energy rather than time is ourmost precious resource, and that energy capacity is diminished by both overuse-chronic stress without recovery-and underuse-chronic recovery without stress. Therefore, we must learn to balance energy expenditure with intermittent energy renewal. To build capacity we must push beyond our normal limits while managing energy carefully. Positive energy rituals can help us do this.  <br /> <br />The book's resources include a summary of the full engagement training system, a list of the most important physical energy management strategies, glycemic index examples, and the full engagement personal development plan worksheet. Loehr and Schwartz do a good job of explaining the principles of the system, but the training program itself could be better defined. However, executives should be in their element developing and customizing the program.	2005-10-08

I don't know where Mark Haddon gained his insights, but he has done a wonderful job of portraying the perceptions and coping strategies of the autistic-like Christopher as he attempts to solve the murder of a neighbor's dog.  Equipped with a brilliant mathematical mind but no mechanisms for undestanding the motivations and machinations of the adults around him, Christopher's search takes him unwittingly into the snarl of the failed relationships and emotional limitations of the adults around him, including his parents. You the reader will perceive elements sad and poignant between the lines of Christopher's narrative. The story resolves in a way that I think will be satisfying to most readers.  It is also a quick read and hard to put down.  For another excellent book with a high functioning autistic/asperger's character, I would highly recommend Elizabeth Moon's recent book, _The Speed of Dark_.	2005-10-08

He has finished the last of four volumes of his systematic theology. Like the first three of the series the layout of the book is the same. At the end of almost every chapter he gives you quotes from the eary church and the medevil church and the reformation. Also it's very apologetic. In this last volume he gives his view about the church and the end times. Dr. Geisler is a dispensationist. He is pre- trib and pre-Mill in his view of the end times. He also talks about church govt and the gifts of the spirit and touches on the issue of tongues. This book is great from the dispensational view point and I give it 5 stars and a book I would recommend. Having said all that, he made some errors. I hope that Dr. Geisler will correct the errors because it is misrepresentation at best and have his chapter on the tribulation redone. In that chapter he talks about preterism. He mention 4 people and rightly explains the different camps in preterism. The problem is ( I don't know this happen being a book by Geisler) he misrepresent two preterist. He makes mention that Full pretersim is a hersey and rightly so. Partial preterism is okay in the Church. He puts Gary Demar and R.C. Sproul in this camp. Which is where they belong. He goes on to mention two more guys and put them in the full preterism camp. Anorld Chilton and Kenneth Gentry. This is errror and make Dr. Geisler look bad. He already misrepresents Calvinism. Now going on to misrepresent Preterism.  <br />Arnold Chilton was a partial preterist all his life until a heart attack then change his position to a full position after that. A Few months later he died. From my understanding he didn't write a book from this position. Dr. Gentry is a partial preterist and the best advocator for this position today. He was the one to influnce R.C. Sproul to this very position. Dr. Gentry already wrote to the pub to have this change and to forward this to DR. Geisler and I hope that Gielser changes in the next edition.  <br /> <br />Good work except for the errors.	2005-10-08

The South in particular is heavily populated with Confederate ghosts and spirits but this ghostly residue is hardly peculiar to the old Confederacy. Gettysburg for example is supposed to be one of the most haunted places in the United States and even the most hard-nosed skeptic has to find it difficult not to feel some kind of aura in that Pennsylvania town.<br /><br />The authors of this book have collected Civil War ghost stories from around the country, including an entire chapter about Gettysburg. Having read other books by this pair of authors I bought this book knowing that most of the stories would be a simple retelling of old legends with no recent eyewitness accounts to bolster the story's believability. I was therefore pleasantly surprised to find that several of these stories do include the much appreciated eyewitness accounts. I found the story of \\"Old Green Eyes\\" at the Chickamauga battlefield to be a particularly interesting entry because first hand accounts of this well known haunting are few and far between.<br /><br />As usual, these authors have a pleasant and enjoyable writing style and they obviously enjoy their own subject matter. They do need to learn however that the term battle casualties includes wounded and missing troops as well as those killed. On several occasions in this book Asfar and Thay vastly over state the deaths in a particular battle because they seem to be counting all reported casualties as deaths. They have also over estimated troop strengths at Gettysburg, especially on the Union side. There are also several small historical errors that they might want to correct in future editions and there is a clear north of Mason-Dixon slant to the book.  The errors aren't major but their presence still hurts the book's credibility.<br /><br />Still, this is a pretty decent ghost book and while it won't send any chills up your spine it would certainly be a good introduction to the ghost lore of the Civil War. Since there are stories in this book from several states east of the Mississippi you might just discover a haunt near you.his is a pretty decent ghost book and while it won't send any chills up your spine it would certainly be a good introduction to the ghost lore of the Civil War.

But by the middle of the first tape, I was ok with it.  I've just gotten so tired of listening to Los Angeles radio stations in the car (we sit in traffic a lot out here) that I thought it would be nice to be entertained by something I really love.  I was glad I did.  Even if you've read the books in the past, it's fun to let the narrator do the reading for you.  AND... something I thought was neat and that made me laugh was... when the narrator would be talking about Koko and Yumyum and a noise they were making, he would sound EXACTLY like my own Siamese cat.  So it made it funny, because I knew exactly the \\"language\\" he was referring to.  (He must have studied Siamese cats before attempting this narration!) <br /> <br />Anyway, I will probably buy more \\"Cat Who\\" books on tape.

Fortunately, playwright and filmmaker, Trevor Griffiths, gives us a model to follow in These Are The Times; A Life of Thomas Paine, a play about how a seemingly ordinary person can do extraordinary things.  That is Thomas Paine's philosophy, his life story, and his legacy. <br /> <br />For the folks who know about Thomas Paine (1737-1809), the enlightened philosopher of the American and French Revolutions, and the 18th century English revolution that did not take place, all the major aspects of Paine's adult life are included in Griffiths's epic tale.  <br /> <br />Griffiths's screenplay, however, is not a documentary. Although rich with historical and multicultural detail, it is a highly innovative portrait of Thomas Paine, the person.  Invented characters and incidents are added to help tell the story, to get to the essence of the life and times. The script begins in 1774 when Paine, aged 37, sails from England to America, and it continues across the time and space of a tumultuous era to his death in 1809 and beyond.  Necessarily episodic, the fast-paced story, with its crisp dialogue and vivid images, is engrossing, sometimes sad, sometimes funny, but ultimately insightful and inspiring. <br /> <br />Thomas Paine is a man with a vision of a better world for all people, and he has the courage to write and speak out for it.  The scenes of These Are The Times are laced with Paine's words, including an occasional voice over the action, often Paine's voice, quoting a relevant passage from his work.   <br /> <br />The Paine first introduced in These Are The Times is a man \\"on the edge of things\\"-ready to seek a new life in a place where an ordinary person might have opportunities.  The ocean crossing shows him to be gentle and helpful to other passengers, ordinary people, like himself, in distress.  In America, though, he sees some of the same disparity and hostility that he left in England between the rich, powerful, and privileged and the ordinary people.  But he is an observer, a self-educated thinker, a truth seeker, and Philadelphia seems to be a place where he can express his radical ideas of liberty and equality and help make a new and different world. <br /> <br />As Paine begins to have an impact, however, the self-styled important people call him \\"a ruffian,\\" \\"a mere adventurer from England.\\"  And, it's true that he is without fortune, family heritage, connections, or even proper grammar.  He is also fiercely independent and without ambition for personal gain and status, so he will never be called a \\"gentleman.\\"  But he is confident of himself, at ease with the high and the low of society, with workers, soldiers, women, and children, as well as with ministers, generals, presidents.  When necessary, he spares no contempt for the rich and powerful who are also corrupt, greedy, and ruthless. <br /> <br />Paine's primary foils are financier/lawyer Gouverneur Morris, Edmund Burke, and Richard Bache, who is Franklin's arrogant son-in-law.  Each is appropriately despicable regarding Paine, believing that he interferes with \\"the natural order of things.\\"    <br /> <br />Griffiths's Paine is blunt, provocative, the \\"orneriest cuss\\" Franklin ever met, defiant to the end, but a man of principle, if occasionally shown to be an \\"innocent\\" in a harsh world.  He is a warm, sensuous man, a loving and sexual man.   <br /> <br />\\"Old Common Sense\\" never becomes part of the select ranks of the illustrious Founders, either during his lifetime or beyond.  His modest station in life and his self-imposed observer-critic role help to keep him from high office, and his challenges to authority, whether state or church, create enemies who slander his name, suppress his ideas, and limit his influence. <br /> <br />Griffiths, though, in his screenplay demonstrates how Paine's life offers a window through which the larger issues may be seen.  From the beginning, Paine becomes aware that a merchant/land-owning class dominates the colonies of the New World.  There is little equality of opportunity.  The noble intentions of freedom and democracy pronounced in the Declaration of Independence (and in the French Dclaration des Droits de l'Homme et du Citoyen) are undermined by the ambitions and greed of those who have already grasped authority and who control the rest of society.  The guiding ambition is still the accumulation of power and personal wealth for the few, not the promotion of the general welfare for the many.  Paine sees betrayals of the revolutionary spirit and inconsistencies between stated ideals and pragmatic realities.  The play, through Paine, challenges the official mythologies of history on both sides of the Atlantic. <br /> <br />Griffiths's play also reveals how relevant Paine's ideas are today.  Paine speaks of a \\"brutal occupation,\\" state terror to stop terrorism, the \\"strutting grandees of Congress,\\" and rulers who may be monumentally incompetent, misuse power, and cause great harm.  Paine is the embodiment of how ordinary people, though, who are well informed, can understand societal issues, can offer visionary solutions, and can become true participants in the democratic process and agents of their own destinies.  Such people frighten and threaten the established order and must be slandered and, if possible, destroyed before they influence a deceived, distracted, and downtrodden populace.  Paine warns, \\"A nation born in greed and graft and corruption will surely drown in them.\\" <br /> <br />Yes, eventually the levees will break.  Then, the bloggers (among whom Paine, a citizen of the world, would thrive today) will demand accountability from government hacks and corporate looters and will call for making the world anew. <br /> <br />These Are The Times is not a political pamphlet.  It is a compelling biographical drama, a lively presentation of ideas that could actually inspire discussion and debate.  If thebarefoot soldiers of 1776, the sansculottes of Paris, and the early 19th century carpenters of Philadelphia can be seen as inspired by Paine's work to make another world for themselves, then these may be the times for us to pick up those ideas again for use against the tyrannies of our own day. <br /> <br />   <br />	2005-10-08

A few days later at the evening meal, Dunne suffered a massive and fatal heart attack. In this exquisitely written and searingly honest book, Ms. Didion recounts her days in the next year or so and attempts to make some sense of it all. Her grief is intensely personal and solitary, yet universal. She remembers what started out as an ordinary day and asks the age-old question: \\"what if?\\" She returns again and again to the following:<br /><br />  Life changes fast,<br />  Life changes in the instant.<br />  You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends.<br />  The question of self-pity.<br /><br />Ms. Didion may not provide a map for getting through the pathless wood of grief; she rather defines it: \\"Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it. We anticipate (we know) that someone close to us could die. . . We might expect if the death is sudden to feel shock. We do not expect this shock to be obliterative, dislocating to both body and mind.\\" And even though I think she would agree with Auden that suffering ultimately is solitary, what she has written can offer consolation to all of us as we can see ourselves and our own struggle with loss in her experience as she defines and differentiates between grief and sorrow: grief is passive but mourning, \\"the act of dealing with grief,\\" requires attention. There are her coping mechanisms-- she avoids as best she can revisiting any place or event (\\"the vortex effect\\") that will trigger a connection between either her husband or daughter-- and finally her attempt of letting go: \\"I know why we try to keep the dead alive: we try to keep them alive in order to keep them with us. I also know that if we are to live ourselves there comes a point at which we must relinquish the dead, let them go, keep them dead.\\" Emily Dickinson, who said as much about death as any other American poet, would have called it, \\"sweeping up the heart.\\"<br /><br />THE YEAR OF MAGICAL THINKING is also a beautiful love story of two people who were married forty years and worked together most of those years. On the dust cover of this book notice that all the letters of the words \\"Joan Didion The Year of Magical Thinking\\" are written in black except the letters that spell out J-O-H-N; those are in gray. A beautiful tribute to Mr. Dunne.<br /><br />A lot of people will return to this book again and again and see images of themselves.

Big pharma is not the problem.  The reason you pay so much for drugs is that all other countries in the world have price controls, so US consumers have to pay for research, which a lot of the pharma profits go back into. <br /> <br />Also, the FDA can't do anything to him--they regulate drugs and food, not literature!  It's not that he can't share these secret cures--he knows that they don't exist, and you're paying him to keep saying it (by the way, isn't it funny that only HE knows what they are?  Wouldn't they be published somewhere other than a random guy's book?)

Here I'll give you a $30 tip whatever you do not buy this book because of these \\"awesome\\" reviews.<br /><br />In this lame attempt the author tries to take you in as him and other PUA's or so called pickup artist, perform their magic of trying to persuade women to have sex with them. Not only does their advice suck, but these women must have been nothing but huge trailer trash sluts. These are just boys and not real men! Real men don't have to have a set of rules, and a huge ego to get women. You just have to be yourself, and if being yourself is not good enough to get the woman of your dreams, well then I guess you just haven't found the right one. Face it, its crap like this book that really explains the problem facing the men in today's world. It's all about getting a piece of A$$, and that my friend is not why we pick up women. Women are not objects for you to test theories and little 6th grade science projects on. Real men like myself, want a woman for more than just what this book says. If you're looking for ways to attract a real woman's heart than you better get to know her. I find this the read to be completely and utterly out of character logically, and morally.	2005-10-08

That's an outrage.  This is one of the classic pieces of women's literature of all time and when I went to college it was required reading at the UW (Washington, not Wisconsen).  The book, besides having obvious overtones of individuality and escape from oppression/societal norms, deals with a wider array of controversial (still, but especially then) topics than can be easily summarized.  (For instance, book could be read as very existentialist because it's never quite certain that she didn't dream it all)  Suffice it to say that the book is an extraordinary read.  Also, it is a small book, sparsely written, episodic, plot-driven, but with just enough sparkling detail to keep the reader transfixed.  And it is funny.  My favorite part is when she meets the satan-cat and realizes the cat is the devil but she is, though mildly alarmed at first, too impressed by his \\"Satanic playfullness\\" to worry.	2005-10-08

The first books are OK, decent storytelling and art, but perhaps not quite as amazing as the many gushing reviews I've since read make it out to be. The premise, as the title says, is that some kind of plague spontaneously kills every male on earth at the same instant -- except a 20something slacker named Yorick and his monkey Ampersand. Following the events of the first two books, this third picks up the story of Yorick, his government agent bodyguard (Agent 355), and the geneticist who might be able to solve save humanity. En route to San Francisco, they are diverted by a Russian woman who convinces them that a space capsule containing two males will soon be landing in a field in Kansas. Meanwhile, the Israeli army squad is still chasing Yorick, helped by intelligence from a rather surprising source in Washington, DC. The Israelis' murky motives for traveling halfway around the world to find Yorick are finally revealed, and the realpolitik rationale for it all is totally laughable and a major letdown. The groups converge in Kansas -- the heroes to await the space capsule, and the Israelis to ambush them. There's some cat-and-mouse with the Israelis, and a sequence in which the authors totally misrepresent how a Stinger surface-to-air missile works. In any event, once all this is done, the surviving astronaut is left at a top secret fallout shelter and the group proceeds onward.<br /><br />The final quarter of the book is unlike any other part of the series so far, as it takes the action away from the heroes and the main plotline. Penciled by a guest artist, the story is about a traveling group of players who have arrived at a small town to perform for food. There's kind of a hokey message about whether art should entertain or provoke, but what's more interesting is why Ampersand shows up in their midst. And even more intriguing is the question of who the ninja trying to kill the monkey is? By the end of this interlude, Yorick, Agent 355, and Dr. Mann have shown up again, but not before a rather racy production! As in the rest of the books the artwork and inking is serviceable, if rather rather pedestrian. The series is definitely all about the writing and scores zero in the style department. Oddly, some have commended it for portraying realistically built women. I would agree with that, except that whenever women are scantily clad in this series, they inevitably have figures that would not be out of place in a \\"men's\\" magazine. In the first book, there's Yorick's bikini-topped Barbiesque girlfriend, and in this one, see pages 149 and 159. Anyway, I guess I'll keep reading the series, but my enthusiasm for it has lessened with each book.ying to kill the monkey is?

As a \\"Reform,\\" it promises to abolish the IRS and income taxation, but in substance and truth will only tighten the iron fist of government around the people&#8217;s productivity, and demand the less fortunate people in our society to shamefully kneel to the iron fist of government to receive their monthly government \\"prebate\\" check.  <br /> <br />Federalist Paper 79 says \\"A POWER OVER A MAN&#8217;s SUBSISTENCE AMOUNTS TO A POWER OVER HIS WILL\\"... [WHAT'S NEW?] <br /> <br />In order to accomplish the featured attractions of the plan, it reportedly will abolish &#8220;all corporate and individual income taxes, payroll taxes, self-employment taxes, capital gains taxes, estate taxes and gift taxes&#8221;. There is one answer: the American voter must demand elected public servants, their employees, put the following wording into the federal Constitution: <br /> <br />The Sixteenth Amendment is hereby repealed and Congress is henceforth forbidden to lay &#8220;any&#8221; tax or burden calculated from profits, gains, interest, salaries, wages, tips, or any other lawfully realized money.  <br /> <br />The Fair Tax proposal is just a suggestion to future Congresses to not lay and collect &#8220;corporate and individual income taxes, payroll taxes, self-employment taxes, capital gains taxes, estate taxes and gift taxes&#8220;. It leaves the door wide open for a future Congress to re-establish such taxes in addition to a newly created across the board consumption tax.  <br /> <br />Real change can only be guaranteed by a constitutional amendment that binds the hands of Congress. Leaders who cosponsor the \\"Fair\\" Tax have one agenda: to leave the door open for Congress to tinker with taxation, manipulate [AGAIN] it as is now done, and they do not promote permanent and real change by a constitutional amendment which expresses the will of the people.  <br /> <br />Adopting the above suggested wording as an amendment to our Constitution will bring us back to our Founding Father's original tax plan which was designed to provide more than sufficient power to raise a federal revenue. But what Congress and friends of big government do not like about our original tax plan is it contains a number of checks and balances to control the actions of Congress and would, if returned, force members of Congress to follow sound fiscal policies, including closing down unnecessary federal government offices.  <br /> <br />Again, overwhelmingly Americans (including business owners) agree the IRS must be tamed. Hopefully the American tax-paying people will get on the same page on this issue and advocate a direct and simple plan, the adoption of a constitutional amendment clearly stating:  <br /> <br />The Sixteenth Amendment is hereby repealed and Congress is henceforth forbidden to lay &#8220;any&#8221; tax or burden calculated from profits, gains, interest, salaries, wages, tips, or any other lawfully realized money. <br /> <br />Then, let's initiate an across-the-board 10% income tax with \\"0\\" deductions and exemptions on ALL income about $100,000. <br />	2005-10-08

Maybe it's not exactly an overcrowded field (great superhero novels, that is) but this one is the hands-down winner. I loved Tom DeHaven's Derby Dugan trilogy (especially the second one) but this Superman novel even surpasses those three books. For the first time ever in a novel, I really cared about Clark and Lois and Lex. DeHaven's feel for the 1930s era in Kansas and Los Angeles and New York is pitch-perfect, and this is probably the best psychological look at Clark coming to term with his powers. Lex Luthor has never been more callously evil, either. There's also a new character here who I don't think comes from the comics: a scrappy, wisecracking newspaper photographer (not Jimmy Olsen). I can't recommend this book more highly.	2005-10-08

Longing for clothing, leisure and privilege, she soon takes up with Drouet, a man willing to support her if she'll consent to live together, unmarried.  From there, she develops an attraction for a married man, Hurstwood, and the power and privilege he possesses.  Their relations and the result of their decisions constitute much of the book. <br /> <br />This novel presented scandalous scenarios of a young, impressionable, and not especially moral woman in a rather dispassionate tone.  It was a rebellious scenario for the times and worth reading for the glimpse it provides into American big city life in the early 20th century. <br /> <br />The writing, however, is unsophisticated, especially in the first half and the characters are superficial.  Readers aren't allowed a deeper look into their minds and motivations.  Except at one point, when Hurstwood engages in serious deception, the book lacks the tension and strong plot that drive American Tragedy.   <br /> <br />For those who haven't read Dreiser before, American Tragedy is a better place to start.  But for those who want to read more of his work, Sister Carrie offers a interesting look into morality, family, and urban life.     <br />	2005-10-08

Hamza, a poetic genius with equally exceptional writer's block, has been banished from academia to wash dishes in a hokey restaurant while his best friend Yehat, a mechanical engineer (of the mekka persuasion) slings insults and date requests at the clients of the video hell hole we works at.  When they're not plundering comic book stores or waxing logic on everything from Love & Rockets to Babylon 5, The brothers Coyote run a volunteer daycamp out of their backyard for the rugrats in the neighbourhood. <br /> <br />Things heat up when a goddess by the name of Sherem returns to E-Town and crosses Hamza's path. Yehat doesn't trust her and does is best to keep Hamza from being crippled into deeper writer's block. But Sherem is more than just a girl who likes comics and quotes Star Wars. She's out to find and protect a sacred artefact and needs Hamza to do it. A group of thugs called The Fanboys are out for the same artefact and a dangerous drug will help lead them and their employers to it. Once in their hands the world will be at their command.  With ancient skills passed down to her from a mysterious school, Sherem prepares Hamza (and his unique ability to find anything) to face these thugs and even higher beings in a race to find it.  Yehat of course, is up for the ride and the fate of the world falls into the paws of The Coyote Kings.   <br /> <br />   Faust crafts a tale about two best friends on the short end of the stick, who still manage to have fun, mixing in multiculturism, sci-fi pop culture, witty banter and unique perspectives one isn't accustomed to in speculative fiction.  THE COYOTE KINGS OF THE SPACE-AGE BACHELOR PAD...is an urgent voice in a genre where the Black voice is rarely heard (and tastefully so).  The added bonus of character profiles a la D&D and first person perspectives from just about every character in the story definitely keeps things interesting. <br />Let's hope a movie that does this book justice comes out of it. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-10-08

The descriptions of the people, places and clothing were exemplary and gave you a real sense of being there with the characters. It follows the true historical happenings very well and does not read at all like a history book. <br /> <br />I, unlike another of the reviewers, found John Tradescant a very likeable character despite the age difference between him and the Duke. I agree, there are many times where a woman is deemed less important than a man. However, that is how it would have been at the time and it is written well. If it had been missed out there would have been complaints on the authenticity of the story so clearly it's impossible to please everybody. <br /> <br />I thought the homosexuality of the book was dealt with well and if someone is homophbic, or finds homosexuality unsettling, then i hardly think they should waste time complaining about the book. Nobody is forcing them to read it and i think it's written very well. <br /> <br />I only have one complaint about the book and that is in the last hundred or so pages. After a very major event, and those who have read the book will know what i refer to, it tends to drag and i lost interest. However, i determinedly finished the book and was rewarded for my resolve. The last chapter was beautiful, full of sadness and yet happiness to. I have no doubt in my mind as to who he saw, but i like the way the author left it open to interpretation. <br /> <br />Overall, i believe it's a billiant book and one which should not be missed.	2005-10-08

This book was written by *the* two Microsoft experts on design guidelines for the .NET Framework: Brad Abrams and Krzysztof Cwalina.  It really is a MUST read for anybody designing OO class libraries especially libraries that are based on managed code (aka .NET Framework).  What I really like is that there are not only \\"Do\\", \\"Do Not\\", \\"Avoid\\", \\"Consider\\" guidelines but most of the guidelines are accompanied by annotations from many different folks (Jeff Richter, Rico Mariani, Chris Brumme, Chris Sells, Brent Rector, etc).  These annotations really help with the pragmatic side of deciding between conflicting forces.  That is, there are many guidelines where you could go one way versus another.

I picked up a copy and held onto it for several weeks, then opened it on a car trip. I read it in less than 24 hours (very odd for me). <br /><br />I couldn't put it down. I won't recap the plot because plenty of other reviewers have already competently covered that.<br /><br />The author does a very ood job getting us to sympathize with the main character, he is not a saint nor does he perform unbelieveable feats. The plot was believable but not predictable, there were lessons to be learned but they were not shoved down your throat. The whole thing was balanced. <br /><br />Think of this as similar to the movie Groundhog Day but instead of one day a 20-25 year span. Speaking of movies I think this is one of those rare books that would be equally good on the screen, if it was properly handled.<br /><br />My only criticism is the Starsea segment. It went a little over the top i.e., \\"Greatest movie of all time\\" with rave critical reviews and an unlikely new age sci-fi plot. I would have have found it more realistic if it had simply been a very successful film with not yet famous cast and crew that was incongruous or out of place. A minor point. <br /><br />Great book, pick up a copy now and be prepared to not put it down anytime soon.   <br /> <br /><br />	2005-10-08

I want to heartily urge everyone to read ITS SUPERMAN by Tom DeHaven, but also want to \\"warn\\" you that its a very different type of Superman story...in some ways.<br /><br />Its basically Superman's \\"origin\\" but set more in the \\"real world\\" than ever before. You will find much, much more Clark Kent here than the Big Blue Boy Scout. There's real people populating this novel, real emotions, real actions, real personalities, and really wonderful, quirky characters and situations. DeHaven veers off from the comic book Superman mythos at various points but these diversions are worthwhile and fascinating.<br /><br />One of the most interesting characters in the book is Lex Luthor. DeHaven paints him as the train wreck you can't look away from, evil and calculating, but intriguing and deep. He's a combination of the out-and-out villainous Luthor of legend and the more-recent crooked-businessman from the modern comics.<br /><br />The dialogue is crisp and multi-faceted and the scenes are poignant and...humorous.<br /><br />Yes, there's humor here, but this is definitely not a \\"comedy\\" novel. DeHaven's fans will know what to expect. The situations are sometimes so outrageous that you may laugh and smile at the same time you cringe and feel the horror.<br /><br />Its not a pristine world this Superman lives in. Its a sweaty, often soiled world and all is not clean and bright. But is is captivating and literary.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. DeHaven. A truly unique novel.<br /><br />Jim!	2005-10-08

I am a huge fan of Ms. Roberts work and applaud her moving more into stories where the emphasis is more on the mystery than the romance.  This was a well-crafted story, beginning when Reena is young and traveling through experiences in her life to present day.  The excellent characters, relationships, dialogue and sense of place, along with the romance and intimate scenes that are the hallmark of Robert's writing are all here.  The only problem I had was that you know the villain from the beginning, so it does diminish the element of suspense.  Still, it is understandable that Reena doesn't put it together until the end and the final scenes bring the suspense into the story.  There is graphic violence and profanity, but it's realistic and clear that Roberts did her research on fires.  Roberts is an excellent writer who has a permanent place on my \\"must buy\\" list.	2005-10-08

I've always found Yoh's character to be interesting, as he's a welcome departure from the \\"loud and stupid\\" male protagonists that frequent manga like One Piece and Naruto. Ren's character, however, is getting a little confusing...he recently preached about how he wants to stop the bloodshed of his family's reign, yet is not above spilling blood in order to achieve his goals. I say he should just remain a little ball of hatred, pure and simple.<br /><br />The action is spectacular, and Takei's artwork, as usual, is dynamic and full of kinetic energy (he constantly seems to find new, awsome poses for Amidamaru).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story doesn't progress much in this volume. The whole battle takes up nearly the entire book, and it STILL isn't finished...I'm seeing shades of DBZ and One Piece in here (meaning animes that are made of nothing but long, boring, mindless fights with annoying twists). Thankfully, this fight keeps you on edge, as Yoh's power seems to be to pull some new, wild tactic out of his behind at the last minute to keep from getting slaughtered.<br /><br />Overall, kinetic and exciting, and, of course, if you've got the last 6 volumes, you'll want this one. If you're a manga fan looking for a new series, this will give you a new, interesting series to pick up.	2005-10-08

The songs are easy enough that it won't take me weeks to learn them - a big plus. But the arrangements are put together so well and sound really beautiful.  The book is labeled as a \\"medium-difficult\\" level, but I would classify it as slightly easier than that. I also bought Chris Rice - The Living Room Sessions which is labeled the same and it appears to be a bit more difficult than this book. All the same, I know I am really going to enjoy playing from this one!	2005-10-08

I bought the book and finished it in 3 days. Its one of those books you cant put down.<br /><br />The book is not going to get you into anyone's pants like a magic wand. That you will have to do yourself. But it will give you a better perspective on what it takes to play the game. It is implied that if you have no game at all, then it can only help.<br /><br />The book is written in a story form, not like a textbook but there is a lot of substance about details of the game. You have to have your own intelligence and intuition to read between the lines and understand what's really going on.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a to read a great modern day story about the struggle men go through just to get (and keep) the attention and interest of a woman.<br /><br />In a world where most men feel at the mercy of women when it comes to sexual matters, reading this book is very empowering and the most refreshing change in perspective. I recommend it to every guy even if just for wicked entertainment.<br /><br />Halcyon	2005-10-08

The layout is perfect for moms, with separate weekday spaces for each family member. Once you get used to the unusual visual layout (week days are stacked vertically rather than the standard horizontal layout of most calendars) it's a big help in organizing your time. If Boynton ever makes the daily spaces a little larger, (personally I wouldn't mind if the calendar were larger as I hang it on a door anyway) I'll give her that fifth star, but otherwise, it's a wonderful calendar.	2005-10-08

[The very fact that the English version used in the score is NOT the original Poe poem-set can indicate just how virtually untranslateable poetry usually happens to be (hence one book trying to do that writing of such attempts as 'a study in failure')!!]  The only regret from this non-Italianophile writer is that the the instrumental nomenclature is in Italian (unlike the same original publisher's \\"Ostróva Mjórtvïkh\\" {Isle of the Dead}, Op.29, which was basically done in German);  however, that's inconsequential.  [Another thing that might have been of help could have been to print the two scores in one volume;  furthermore, the original publisher Gutheil often lets blank staves fill up pages and systems where perhaps they could have profitably been omitted - but that's not Dover's fault at all...]  Otherwise, bravo Dover!!!!	2005-10-08

There is also another book, a follow up story about it, The Blessing of the Animals. Both books touch the heart. <br /> <br />Philip Gonzalez who goes out every night to feed and care for feral cats after he adopted Ginny, found Ginny in an animal shelter. Ginny herself was rescued after left alone in an apartment without food and water. <br /> <br />In the book you will read about Madam, Revlon and other cats that haven been rescued by Ginny and are disabled in some way or other. Madam is deaf and Revlon only has one eye. <br /> <br />I did some research and learned that Ginny passed away recently. There is a Ginny Fund and a Ginny Fan Club. Both of them have more info. <br /> <br />If you know a cat lover and you look for the perfect gift, this book and The Blessing of the Animals is a sure winner. <br />	2005-10-08

The Kingdom of God was the central message of Jesus.  This book brings the message to life through it's examination of the topic, and--even though it's a theology book--presents the material in a very clear, readable way.  I can honestly say that this book has brought a fresh understanding of God's will and purposes to my Christian walk.  Of all the Christian books I've read, this one definitely makes my top 10 list.	2005-10-08

A very untidy but neatly packaged ending. The whole raison d'etre of Allen's otherwise well-written book totally falls down after Hess 'flies' because there isn't a shred of proof offered that the the man that 'landed' was actually Rudolf Hess. In fact the converse is true - the book assumes, as so many others have done, that he was the real Deputy Fuhrer.  <br />The real Hess lies under the N. Sea, where Goering, Himmler and Adolf Galland put him, and the man that flew in was a Himmler plant, a 'double', which is why everyone wrote him off as a complete ignoramus. So you see, the Nazis had a sense of humour. <br />It would have been politcally quite impossible to imprison - or kill - the real Deputy Fuhrer - if he had come on a peace mission with genuine intentions (however misguided), and such acts would have run the risk of the terrible retribution from Hitler. However, after the event, in Germany, it was business as usual. Hess gone mad? Why were the Nazis so relaxed about it all? <br />How the man who was retained in Spandau prison was kept quiet for so long is an interesting question which has never been answered, neither in this book nor any other yet published. <br />Was this the man that flew in - or a double's double this time put in place by the British, an inmate from a prison camp in the Isle of Man? Why were Hess's relatives so determined to prevent exhumation or DNA testing of the body of the prisoner? Were they afraid to suffer the same fate as the Haushofers? Was this German 'sippenhaft' or British 'sippenhaft' work or a bit of both?	2005-10-08

At the very end it made no sense why Camille was suddenly able to summon some spirit, because there had been too many incidents prior to the final straw which should have forced a will to emerge.  If we were to believe our hero in the end that she was so strong, then we are left to grapple with the question of why her strength remained torturously dormant when confronted by her mother's never ending malice and evil actions. Some of the times that Camille yielded you were left wondering why, since a truly strong spirit would have found a way to defy her mother far sooner.<br /><br />I had images of this author being threatened with non-publication unless she agreed to a volume of violent torture, sadism, martyrdom and self-loathing that even the most uncensored cable channel would refuse to show.<br /><br />I twice went back to the bio on back, searching for some reason for why this fresh faced authoress, with a seemingly quaint life, would stoop to such a vomitous outpouring.  No character in a romance could hope to develop personality enough to overwhelm the overall effect of grim endurance that both the characters and the reader are forced to share.<br /><br />I hope that she will try again and try for a little balance. Her opening passages showed that the author does indeed feel at home with a pen and a plot.	2005-10-08
